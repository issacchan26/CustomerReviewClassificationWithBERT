review,overall rating
Great ambiance and service. Lots of menu choice. We never felt rushed and had a wonderful evening catching up with friends.,3
"Exceptional service, cuisine, ambience.  Window seating was splendid with serene autumn view.  Always a pleasurable experience.",4
"Our server Darcy was wonderful!  She accommodated numerous requests as we were with 2 hard of hearing people.  Darcy assisted with the volume of music and moved us to a more suitable table.
She had positive and friendly demeanor and went above and beyond.
Unfortunately one of our party was ill once arriving home from the meal.  The rest of us liked what we ordered.",2
Great food choices for lunch and excellent service. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming.,3
Always reliable and great place to go for lunch or dinner.  Parking is a bonus!,4
Great Renovation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,4
"We sat on the patio. Service was outstanding‚Ä¶fun and efficient.
Food was excellent and the patio was comfortable‚Ä¶aside from a group of Harleys. 
The Miller is always great‚Ä¶a little pricy but worth it",4
"Great place to meet a friend for lunch - I had the roast chicken club which was very tasty - two small things: they could degrease the bacon with some paper towels and the chicken was shredded and mixed with mayo so a bit rich and messy to eat. Fries are perfect! 

Service was super friendly and attentive.",3
Our server was awesome. She picked up on our birthdays celebration and brought us a yummy dessert to share. She gave us the perfect amount of space. Thank you!,3
We had a table in the window balcony are & it was quiet-nice not having to yell back & forth with your table mates!! Service was great & the food was delicious.,4
"We went for an early dinner, 4:30.  We indicated to staff we would require wheelchair access ie lower dining room or patio as wheel trans drops off in the parking lot.  First the place closed the patio, then they closed the lower dining room.  

If you are going to charge high prices for food then your service should be on par.  Closing off rooms especially knowing a patron needs wheelchair access is mean and cheap !

We dine at the Miller often.  Shape up or we will shape out !!!

Annoyed",3
Great restaurant and we had a great time and fun..,4
Great service by our well informed waiter. He knew the menu possibilities in great detail.,4
A beautiful outdoor patio with excellent food and service.,4
Well done. Much better than the previous miller taverns... (except for the Jolly Miller. #IYKYK),4
Great food. Excellent service! Steak was cooked to perfection and crab cakes were amazing.,4
Music a bit loud to enjoy a conversation in the dining area.,3
The food options were excellent. Loved the warm vibe of the restaurant.,4
Great place,4
It was amazing service. Our Server was really kind and super nice! :),4
Amazing staff...we were greeted by two people upon entering. Great food and service.,4
"Patio ambiance was great on a hot summer late afternoon. 
Food, and drinks were great, although a bit pricey.
Service was excellent!",3
"We used to like the Jolly Miller but the last two times we have been there the food has been, quite frankly, dreadful. Yesterday we ordered fish and chips, what could possibly go wrong?  Well, the fish was minuscule barely two bites. The chips were impossibly soggy and there was a large glop of friend onion on the plate that ruined the dish completely. Also the cost is jaw-dropping even in this hyper inflationary period we find ourselves.

We will not be returning,",1
"Ambiance is beautiful, food is good however pricy and same as the wine per glass. 
Service is nice",3
Overall pretty decent. Lots of Reno‚Äôs since I was there last.,3
Big Wasp/Bee issues on the outdoor patio made it difficult to enjoy our yummy meals.  The charcuterie board to start was very good great way to start with a nice glass of wine. But pretty pricey for lunch. burger was $29!  Our Waiter was wonderful.,4
one of the nicest patios with trees and flowers.  Wheelchair access,3
"Had the 12oz strip, and it beautifully tender and cooked to perfection!!!  Server was wonderful. Would definitely eat there again!",4
"Lovely meal.
Portions a little large.
Would recommend it highly!",4
Overall good experience. However it was a bit cold for the patio. Biggest issue is there was a RAT running around on the patio,2
"The music was too loud. Food e good. Server was excellent, run off his feet. Unfortunately had to skip dessert.",3
"The new renovations are amazing, same delicious food and the service was impeccable",4
"Our visit was a great success.  The food, wine and ambiance were super.  The wine was a pleasant surprise - excellent for money.  Thank you and keep up the good work.",4
This is one of our favourite places to go! No surprise that it was the same great dining restaurant as always. Great service and delicious food! Will be back,4
"Great place, a bit pricy for the quality of the food.",4
Thank you for the great food and service.,4
"Quite busy on Sunday evening‚Äîlarge parties on the lower patio and the lone waiter was overwhelmed. Took considerable time to get the bottle of wine, then quite a wait to order, once order arrived I poured our wine throughout the meal, was never asked how things were and after one coffee a bill arrived. Have always given 5 stars but not this time.",2
Everything was absolutely awesome!!! Many thanks!!,4
"Food, as always, was fantastic.  I do need to mention that our server was amazing, so lovely and attentive, would love to be able to request him on our next visit",4
The food and service very good. Asked for a capuccino but it was just light coffee with some foam at the top They should serve Capuchino made the traditional way.,4
"Beautiful outdoor patio except for annoying wasps. We had to move indoors. We enjoyed our lunch. I had the Potebello Burger which was delicious. The service was good. The downstairs renos are outstanding, a big improvement.",4
"We have come often in previous years for the hamburgers. This time,  hamburgers were smaller than previous, over cooked, tasteless and dry despite being asked for medium cooked. The fries were cold. Completely overpriced and a not only a waste of money but an embarrassment to our guests.
The service was excellent however.",0
Great food. Amazing service. Great ambiance. Will be going back !,4
The porterhouse was delicious but the sides were lacking. Mac cheese with crab had very little crab.,3
"We went for appetizers and the menu was limited 
For different tastes - and over priced 
Overall- place did not cater to different occasion- prices are too high for a casual place",0
Enjoyed the reno.  Menu prices were steep.  Was told there were no window balcony tables available and the watched empty tables out there never filled while we dined which was disappointing.  Our server was good but very busy so we had long gaps between refilling our drinks.,2
"It was horrible they called us that will be raining and they will give us balcony seat but then when we went they offered very bad table and we said we‚Äôve been offered balcony they said no we don‚Äôt have we left and no one even said sorry,second time we gave them Chance horrible service",0
Nicely remodeled. great food (but not cheap). Will be back.,4
"Quite expensive for entrees.  Lunch ended at 3 p.m. had to order from dinner menu. Glass of Canadian wine expensive. Escargot tasteless. 

Lovely spot, really convenient parking. Very attentive service.",2
Service was friendly but not intrusive. Food was excellent.,4
"A beautiful patio and a favourite outdoor patio. Our server was friendly and helpful. However, our food took too long. 45+ minutes for macaroni and cheese and sandwiches.
We also felt $18.00 for a bloody ceaser over the top!",2
"Selection of oysters was limited. French fries came a bit overdone on a dry side. Drinks, my Dry Martini and a Cosmo, were quite good, would give it 8 out of 10.
On a separate note, as it  becomes rather cool after 8pm, there is some wind draft effect on the veranda...may be consider stopping the ceiling fans after 8.30pm.",3
"Good food, except I don't like and DID NOT book sitting outside.",4
Great experience and service.  Watress was extremely attentive and food was excellent.,4
"Very friendly staff, the food is great and always consistent! Great patio for the summer üôåüèΩ",4
"Nice atmosphere, very good service, good food, very overpriced.",3
"Lovely rooms and patio (which is huge). The food was solid - French onion soup was terrific, the steak was good, but a bit more cooked than the medium rare we asked for.",3
Service was outstanding. Great food and wine selection. Great experience!,4
"Disappointed with the food, cold french fries, awful cole slaw, fish was pretty good. Service was fine, location was good. In the upstairs balcony area the noise level was so high it was difficult to have a conversation.",2
The fries was stale and dry .. The Tuna tartar was awful ( strong fishy taste),2
"Love this place. 
Only thing is that the server was not very friendly or professional, and when it came time to pay, she automatically set the machine to give herself a 20% tip. The costumer should be able to make the choice not the server.",4
"It was the first time we took my dad to a restaurant since he has needed a walker/wheelchair. The staff were so kind, accommodating and helpful. They made us feel so welcome. The food was also wonderful and the whole atmosphere. We all had a lovely, memorable time.",4
A bit tired of the lunch menu. Maybe some new choices?,3
"This was the first time having lunch at the The Miller and found it very enjoyable.
My friends and I will surely come back again.  The patio was delightful and the food was good.",3
"Our waiter went above and beyond to serve us and the whole patio, exceptional service despite being short staffed. He was the only waiter we saw. The food was late but delicious whey we were finally served.  I‚Äôm assuming the kitchen was also short staffed.",4
"We sat in the patio and it was stunning.  Enough space between tables for privacy and quiet 
Food was excellent as was the service 
It‚Äôs a regular place for me",4
"Accommodated change in reservation.  
Friendly and competent staff",4
Went for last minute drinks with the girls for a friend‚Äôs bday. Only a few of us drink so wasn‚Äôt sure how we‚Äôd get treated. Server couldn‚Äôt have been nicer. Had fries for the table - they were crisp and nicely seasoned. They put a candle in sorbet for my friend as she‚Äôs gluten-free.,4
"It was a lovely, quiet dinner. The food was great and the service was great! We have been there before and it is always consistently good. Ôøº",4
Price is a bit high for what you get and for a tavern,4
"Welcomed by the host outside upon arrival, enjoyed a meal on the patio to celebrate my aunts birthday.  The multi layers patio with pergolas and string lights created a beautiful and relaxing ambiance.  The meal was delicious but a bit pricy.  Service was great and was surprised with a dessert for my aunt birthday.  Overall great experience and highly recommend.",3
"Beautiful Patio, friendly service and the best cob salad value in the city. 
Chicken is roasted and tender, nice size pieces. Overall excellent salad for the $$$",3
A perfect spot for a quality lunch or dinner - great food and surroundings and attentive serving staff as well as convenient parking.,4
"Professional knowledgeable server, lovely patio ambience",3
"food, especially the french fries, not as good as in previous experience.",2
The food was great.  However the service was quite slow.  I dine at miller frequently and I think it was short staffed for the long weekend.,3
"Our waiter Andrew was excellent, the food was fantastic and the location/atmosphere was second to none. Looking forward to next time",4
Fantastic location with excellent service and quality food - highly recommended,4
"Excellent service and food. Love the patio.
Attentive server. Ilan is an outstanding chef.",4
Excellent service and a menu that had  variety. The food served was excellent,4
"Love this restaurant, location, food, ambiance, everything!",4
"Amazing atmosphere, spectacular service and fantastic food",4
"Great renovations, the ambience is amazing! menu and food quality are 5*
Andrew and Dave were wonderful! 
Thanks a lot!",4
Katie was an amazing server. We will definitely come back. Love the patio! Food was great as usual.,4
"Great location but some servers disappoint experience 
Server very slow , messed up order served apps with dinner 
too long to get check to table.",2
"It was a beautiful setting on the glass patio. We had the Cobb salads - the best I've ever had. Service was smart, friendly and perfectly timed.

Thank you for a great experience!

Andrew Harvie",4
"Had to ask for music to be turned down.
Host made flippant remark.",3
The patio was lovely.  The food was pricey but good.  The service was very pleasant.  My only complaint was that the bloody Caesar I had was served in a very small glass that narrowed at the bottom.  It was filled 3/4 full of ice with very little actual drink in it.  It seemed like it was really just a glass full of ice.,3
The food was very mediocre. The strip loin was tough and the peppercorn sauce tasted artificial. The food was exceedingly overpriced. The only reason we went is for their magnificent patio but that wasn‚Äôt enough to make up for a $30 glass of average wine.,2
Thank you for helping us celebrate our family Bday and Anniversary.  Always superb meal and venue in North York.  David was so attentive and helpful.  Hope to return soon! Everyone loved the ambiance of the patio,4
Excellent staff and service! The food taste and quality was also good.,4
Great ambience and decor. It was raining so we couldn't sit outside but we would love to return to experience the patio.,4
I‚Äôve been there before and I was very impressed with the place after renovations were completed. Very classy I‚Äôd say,4
Loved the food! Tuna tartare was particularly outstanding and adored the cute outdoor setup.,3
"The new look, menu and service amazing!!! The staff, management outstanding! The food and vibe is chic but understated. Our waiter was Darren üíïthe patio is gorgeous and comfy and the music was nicely playing in the background so you could enjoy it but also carry a convo. Love that they brought back the Raw Bar so fresh and yummy! Highly recommend this hidden gem to everyone.",4
"The patio is beautiful. Menu has a great selection, and the burgers are delicious. Overall had a nice experience.",3
"I was here to celebrate my friends birthday
The food was exceptional, but the service was spectacular!!!
Highly recommended",4
"The particular table we were given was in a fairly quiet spot with access to fresh air but not to hot, considering the day.  The waiter was very competent and offered us excellent recommendations.",3
"Always an excellent experience. 
Service is spectacular. 
Food is always good. 
U can not go wrong at The Miller.",4
"The ambience on the patio was great, the service was excellent, the food tasted amazing.........extremely pricey... we were caught off guard with how expensive it has become.",4
Sat on the patio - very nice evening. It did rain but the patio is covered so it was not a problem. Server was very friendly and attentive.,3
We really enjoyed our evening with dinner on the patio.  The food was delicious and the service was great.   We will return.,4
Lovely outdoor patio. Fish and chips and chicken salad sandwich were delicious.,4
Too expensive but great ambiance.  outside better than inside. but bring lots of money. just not worth it.,1
"Our waiter, Peter was amazing.  Great attitude, very attentive.
3 of us had the Wagu Beef Hamburger-so delicious.  Portions are generous.
The other person had salad with chicken and she said that it was really very good.

A relaxing evening on the patio with great food and friends.",4
"Very tasty, whatever you order! We enjoyed the meals, service and ambience.",3
Great location for a nice dinner regardless of the occasion.  The food & drinks are great and the service is excellent.  Decor is on point and the patio is one of the nicest  in the area.,4
"Great food. Service was at the beginning tentative. Our server must be a new team member. 
It is a bit embarrassing for when one of our guests wanted vegetables instead of mashed potatoes with their dinner that the first response is ‚Äú there will be an extra charge to substitute ‚Äú. This puts a guest in a very awkward position. At $45 a plate what is the extra cost to substitute one side for another. This is not exceptional service when consumers these days have allergies or dietary restrictions.",4
Great afternoon! Thank you Craig for being attentive and awesome with our group. Lovely Sunday lunch.,4
We always enjoy the Miller. Absolutely love the patio area and the food is delicious.,4
The patio at the Miller is excellent for summer dining. it is tucked away behind hedges and very private. The food is very good and their hamburgers are terrific. The quality of the house wine is excellent and the wait staff extremely helpful.,3
The revamped dining area is well designed and the food was top notch,4
"We‚Äôve always enjoyed our lunches and dinners at the Miller, but I wish they had a more varied luncheon menu this summer.",3
Beautiful outdoor patio. Delicious food and fantastic service as always!,4
"Our dinner was amazing. The service, food, overall atmosphere was amazing.  Highly recommended.",4
Sat on the patio with a client for a business lunch. Exceptional service from Julie. Casual and classy atmosphere all wrapped into one.,4
"Quite good food but Overpriced. Music was too loud and more suited to a dance club, not good for dining and conversation.",2
"From the time we were seated, it was over 10 minutes before a server appeared, and only after I complained!  Water served was warm - (outside patio temperature) and not 
served with ice. The ambience and renovations to the outside patio are exquisite, but it would appear that the cost of the renovations have been added to the food and liquor prices in one big jump! Outrageous, compared to last year. The food was average, not great but not bad either.
My spouse said she would not be going back there, all things considered.
Significant changes are required, as evidenced by the number of customers present.",1
"Food was flavourful and well presented.  Menu is rather limited, mostly focused on steaks and ala carte options.   Looks like the place is trying to position as a high end steak house unfortunately with prices commensurate with pricey downtown steak houses.   Wine list was limited for a high end restaurant.  Service was good, very attentive.",2
As usual--i live in Hoggs Hollow--your food  was seriously over priced. My bill for 2 smaal enties and one beer was over $100.00 Yopu are a tavern not a hgh -end restaurant!!!!!! I will not eat there again and I can walkto you in 5 minutes from my house. I suppose you must be just arrogantor living in lala land.,1
"The meals were absolutely delicious and our party of 4 truly enjoyed them. Unfortunately, we were dissatisfied with a few things. 

Firstly, my brother-in-law had wanted olives but was told they are not available during dinner. It is hard to understand why as olives are not something that need to be prepared and would not interfere with meal preparation time. Seems a little snooty to be frank; it‚Äôs not gauche to have a plate of olives after 6:00! 

Secondly, I had booked the dinner as an anniversary dinner for my in-laws. No mention of the anniversary was made which was disappointing. I did not put a special request in but in other fine restaurants, they at least wish you a happy anniversary and if they are kind, they bring some cookies or even offer a complimentary drink. None of this happened. 

Thirdly, my in-laws arrived and were seated when my husband and I arrived a few minutes late due to an unexpected phone call. I entered the restaurant to find my in-laws as my husband parked our car. As we were waiting for him, a staff member approached us and asked if we wanted to order a drink and I explained that we were waiting for my husband. He repeated his question again and I again mentioned we‚Äôre waiting for my husband. Maddeningly, he asked again! I motioned to the empty chair, told him we were a party of four, not three and asked him if he had been drinking himself. How bizarre that he just couldn‚Äôt accept or understand that we were waiting a few minutes for my husband to arrive.

The renovations to the restaurant are beautiful but I would have preferred some softer lighting downstairs as it was dinner time. It was quite bright.

Our waiter was professional and generally very attentive. He was not the man that had addressed me earlier about ordering prematurely. 

In short, food was very good with other improvements needed regarding customer experience to have made our experience a superlative one. We left feeling underwhelmed on that front.",2
"Lovely spot, but terribly overpriced 
Shrimp cocktail $44 plus tax and tip makes it $56 for three shrimp.
Plus two salads, two drinks each, all in $260",2
"Great renovations.. love the atmosphere.
Service was excellent.
Outdoor dining is very pleasant .",4
Appreciated waiter turning down volume of music. A nice outdoor patio but very close to road which at times was quite noisy. Otherwise a nice place to dine.,4
The patio is very good and the food fantastic. The server was outsatnding.,4
Food is very pricey and not worth it. You can do better at many other places.,1
Outstanding food and impeccable service.  Our new favourite!,4
"Katie our server was great. Very nice, relaxed evening. Ambience of Miller was good.",4
The food was amazing.  We sat on the balcony.  It was lovely!!!,4
"Always a pleasure to dine here! Excellent service, great food and beautiful ambiance.",3
"Food was great. Mike, our server was very attentive and helpful.
I especially appreciated the level of service; a server poured our wine, no server scooped in to clear plates before all were finished. That is so nice to not feel rushed. Thank you.
Slightly more expensive than I had planned however we felt good about the evening for a 65th birthday, so all good!",4
Food and Service are always good.  Michelle is the waitress for our table and she is the best!,3
What a treat on my husband‚Äôs birthday! The food was delicious and we will definitely be back.,4
"A great local, indoor outdoor location with good food, pleasant service, and a nice ambiance",3
"Living northeast of TO, the Miller has long been my first choice when meeting friends who live downtown or in the west end. An easy decision, given the convenient location & parking, and most especially the fantastic food and ambience. GM Andrew Inman is everywhere, making sure that everyone is happy while also overseeing the ongoing yet unobtrusive renovations. Not the cheapest eatery but well worth every penny.",4
"Newly and Nicely Renovated.
Not very many Vegan Options.",3
"We were celebrating our birthdays. We were outside on a lovely day. We had a leisurely lunch.
Our waiter was very nice and left us  alone to chat. He brought us a birthday dessert to share.",4
The service was so great and the food was fantastic!    It made our Birthday celebration special.,4
"Service very good  , restaurant smelled  like dirty dishwater‚Ä¶ but most importantly the pricing is ridiculous‚Ä¶ they rival Michelin star restaurant prices and is nowhere warranted. It‚Äôs cynical. I would never return",2
Good food though pricey. Great service. Love the renovations.,3
"Amazing ssrvice, great food. Perfect for any occasion, comfortable, yet chic. The patio is one of the most beautiful in town.",4
"not impressed with the quality of the food on yesterday's visit.  The food is normally excellent, however yesterday no one in our party wanted to eat their meals.  The burger was dry (over cooked, when asked for med rare).  The wago flat iron steak was also over cooked (asked for med rare), and the steak seasoning was very over powering.  The only thing that tasted good was the salads.   We shared the truffle mac n cheese, and that was also not very appetizing.  We sat in the patio, and it was great.",2
Good service and good food.  Suitable for celebration.,4
"The food was overpriced and underwhelming.  For example, oneof the appetizers was bread and butter for $9.  $40 moules frites?!?",1
"The service was very bad 
Different servers kept going back and forth and kept questioning us .
They took our appetizers which were French onion soup and dinner rolls after 4-5 minutes without even asking if we were finished .
They were so rushing and we felt like they just wanted us to leave .
we asked for a well done steak and they brought the steak medium-rare they took the steak to cook it more but brought it back the same .
I even tipped the server 20% but I have to tell you about the service which was very very bad.",0
"Great food and nice outdoor patio, though a bit pricey. Service was also very good.",3
"We arrived at the restaurant and although there were many tables of 4 empty both on the patio and the upper open seated area (which were still available to reserve on open table), we were seated at a hot, noisy cramped table for 2 beside the door leading in and out of the kitchen. After asking if we could be moved to one of the other available tables, we were told that they were saved for parties of 4 only. After 15 years of being a regular patron from the neighborhood, It is sad that we will likely never return.",0
"Nice patio, amazing service! It was a great experience!",4
"Reno is beautifully done. It was too busy so the service was good. 
The staff were very present and friendly. 
Prices are high and I would not say it is value for the money. 
Rolls were tasteless but the waiter took them off the bill which was good of him. 
Coffee was delicious. 
Toffee cake delicious, chocolate mousse cake mediocre.",2
"Food was okay, ambiance was nice, service was very good, prices were way too high.",2
I have been to Miller Tavern 4 times and everytime I had the pleasure of being served by Michelle. Great server.,4
"Non-existent service and obscenely overpriced food. Bland salad nicoise with a few pieces of tasteless brownish tuna for $40.  The $32 burger tasted ok but was so greasy and soggy the bun immediately fell apart.  Waited for 20 minutes for the menu. After we finished eating, I waited for another 20 minutes and finally had to go looking for a waiter to clear the table.  Never again will I set foot in this place.",0
"Great patio... Best in the city. Great food, staff and location!",4
The Miller is a neighbourhood favourite  but getting very pricey. Many other options close by a better value.,3
The seafood linguini was the best I‚Äôve ever had ever !  I‚Äôve always enjoyed all the entrees but first time trying this one.  They sat the 2 of us overlooking the parking lot when tables of 4 overlooking the patio were empty our entire stay.  The interior dining room was closed.  The smoke bothered me   Next time I‚Äôll sit downstairs if the air is bad,4
"Always the perfect dinner experience. 
Never, and I mean never fails to satisfy. 
Even during the renovations, it always felt like The Miller. 
Thanks to delightful Michelle and the rest of the staff. 
U should visit soon. It‚Äôs all open again and looks so good. I‚Äôm",4
Nice place we sat on the patio this time. Really enjoyed it.,4
Beautiful spot to meet friends but very pricey after 4pm ( no happy hour any more),4
"We usually love The Miller but they definitely had an off day today. Haven't been there since last summer and we usually love their patio. One of the nicest in the city. However due to the air quality because of the forest fires we chose to eat inside today.

We were seated downstairs even though the reservation was upstairs. Chairs and booth were very comfortable, but noise level was high. 5 women, of which 4 ordered the fish 'n chips and 1 ordered the chicken club sandwich with bacon well done. Very simple order. It took quite a while for the food to come out and the chicken sandwich had to be sent back because of course, the bacon wasn't even close to well done.

While the other 4 women ate their lunch, the  other one sat there and watched. By the time the sandwich came out the rest of the women were almost done.

Cappuccinos all arrived so cold and we refused them.

Prices have increased substantially from last year, which is in line with everything going up.

I will go back, assuming this was an ""off"" day. We were looking forward to a lovely upscale lunch and were quite disappointed.",2
"First off, the service was great. I mean really REALLY great. Our server was outstanding.  The food was OK. The club sandwich was advertised as grilled chicken, bacon, etc but what came was chicken salad. The bread was thick sliced and difficult to eat and the chicken salad just gushed out of the sandwich.  However, the big challenge was the music. It was too loud to have a conversation. It was completely frustrating.",3
"Excellent cob salad, very fast service, pleasant ambiance...all in all - fantastic experience.
I went there many times; always good experience.
Will come back...more often!!",4
"Our server was so friendly and on the ball.  Very attentive. 
Our little group (3) enjoyed our meal, service and ambiance.",4
"We had Salad and Appi and both were great, would recommend Miller for sure",4
"Despite the circumstances of the day's events that prevented us to celebrate our party till  the birthday cake , it is always a pleasure to come to the Miller tavern.

Wonderful place managed by a kind and professional team.",4
"Beautiful restaurant, food is five star but very pricey. Our server was amazing!",3
"Ordered four steaks at 50.00 each.  Three came out perfect at med rare.  The fourth was over cooked med well.

I sent it back, 8 min later which doesn't sound like a long time but when you're sitting just waiting it's an eternity.

The waitress brings back the steak and said the chef says its cook perfectly. 

WIAT WHAT

I look at her and said, look at the other three steaks on the table that's how they should be cooked.

She leaves to get a manager.  Another nine mins pass.  Everyone else at the table has now finished their meals.

The manager comes back very rudely says ""we put it under the light and it's cooked perfectly"".  At this point I can no longer show him the other steaks as everyone else has finished eating 

I told the manager I should the waitress the other three and they did not look like that.

He was very rude and short and said here.  Here is another one that is less cooked.

That steak was rare and not enjoyable I had two bites .

They took the steak off the bill thinking that would satisfy me.  Incorrect.  It's not the money that was the problem.  It was the service and attitude received from the manager.

The waitress forgot several item's.  Maybe because she was flustered from the chef and manager I dot know.

The Miller use to be a great experience.  It pails in comparison to days past.",0
We had dinner on the beautiful patio. A wonderful way to celebrate a friends retirement and welcome in patio season!,4
"Great service
Nice ambience with a nice renovation
Good food but small servings
Very very very over -priced  for what you get",2
"Service was good but they were a bit slow bringing our drinks.
Food was good but the salads had more 'off' bits in them than I think they should have.
Great ambience and servers!
June",3
Was a great place to celebrate our anniversary.  Our server was great and the food was amazing.  Thank you for the great experience!,4
"Absurdly expensive for what we got. I‚Äôm not one to complain but the seafood tower for $170.00 was a joke. Our bill for my daughter and I with no alcoholic beverages after tip was almost $300.00. They brought everything out at once and we were at a small two person table. We asked them to take some stuff back until we were ready. I‚Äôll give it to them, beautiful restaurant, but I‚Äôll never go back. I should have taken a picture of the platter so I could show. I have NEVER taken the time to write a review, EVER, but this was a joke. Very disappointed!",1
Always consistently top notch food and service.  Thankfully over the years the Miller Tavern team keep things consistent.,4
"Good.  
Staff was excellent.  
Time to receive food was somewhat slow.  

Lunch menu should be updated.",3
"It was empty, no people. Desert menu very limited.",2
Good place to meet friends.  The outside patio is very comfortable,3
Food was excellent.  Waitress was very friendly.  It took a while to get our drinks,4
"My family of 8 had dinner on the beautiful, inviting patio.  The ambience was excellent, and the server was friendly and knowledgeable.  The food was presented nicely and was good.  The menu could offer a few more items.  Very pricey.",4
Ambiance was good but food menus can be more inclusive to people to special eating diet,1
"A must try if you are in the neighborhood. Great food, great service. Awesome neighborhood gem of a restaurant. All newly renovated with a great outdoor patio and indoor glass room (with windows that open) patio. Highly recommend to everyone.",4
"The lobsters were very small.  One grilled  and the other one broiled, both tasted good.  Our sirloin was a bit overcooked, but the quality of the sirloin was good, still tender but a bit dry.
Desserts were the highlight of the evening.  Mango sorbet, was like a frozen mango made into a slushy ice scoop.  The toffee pudding and pavlova were delicious.  Desserts portions were big.  Enjoyed the environment and the service.",2
"After hit and miss visits to The Miller (with our last experience being so poor that we decided to not return again), when we heard that there had been a change to management/menu, we decided to give them another chance‚Ä¶ and are so glad we did!!  Both our servers (Michelle & Greg) delivered exceptional service, going above and beyond to ensure we were well-taken care of.  The food was delicious - serving sizes were more than ample!  The physical updates to the restaurant were also noted/appreciated - the integrity of the building has been kept with subtle updates that were inviting & made us feel welcome.  We definitely will be back!",4
"The Miller is a wonderful local restaurant to meet family or friends!
Great menu, atmosphere and servers.
Our balcony/window was a pleasant option and not crowded.",3
Fantastic evening! Fabulous place to celebrate my birthday. Food was delicious and the service delightful. The entire restaurant has been beautifully renovated. Highly recommend the Miller for any occasion or anytime.,4
"The Miller continues to provide exemplary service and meals. Our server was very attentive, paying attention to the smallest details. Our compliments to the chef, the food was delicious. Andrew, the general manager, was also very present making sure that our table and others were being taken care of. Looking forward to going back again and enjoying the beautiful patio. Cheers",4
Service was a little slow.  Seemed to be short staffed but the servers that were available were extremely pleasant and helpful.  Food was very good.,3
"Great patio, menu and service. The new renovation downstairs that I saw‚Ä¶fantastic !",4
"Server good, but service slow. Had to wait long time for mains.
Music way too loud, had to ask for it to be turned down to hear each other speak.
Food generally okay, but frites were not.
Seemed less than good value.
Would recommend with cautionary comments.",3
"Been at this place many times and always happy , but this time it was much different . No comments about food, but it didn‚Äôt match the price at all. Server came up once and then was chairing to everyone at the bar.
No one gave wifi password when asked 5 times.
A lot of attitude.
Not coming back anymore .",1
The food was very delicious as well as the ambiance I was served by Andri ( he was amazing ),4
Food was disappointing for price. Service excellent.,3
A very expensive restaurant with average food. Not sure why the cocktails here are near 20 dollars.,1
It was a great experience. We had a wonderful waitress. I‚Äôm looking forward to dining there again.,3
Never going back again - not a good quality of food even after paying amount higher than everywhere else.,0
"Excellent food, patio atmosphere and wonderful service.",4
As always we had a great time. It was a nice day so we ate outdoors. The servers were attentive and friendly. We will be back!!,3
It‚Äôs beautifully renovated but quite expensive for lunch.,4
Very good food but at the prices for the mains they should include sides. We weren‚Äôt offered to add sides at the time of ordering.,3
"We dined on a Saturday lunch on outdoor patio. It was a very beautiful patio tucked in quiet side even it‚Äôs by busy Yonge Street. We feel breezy and relaxing. Personally I like to sit under the Sun but I‚Äôm okay sit under shades as well. You‚Äôll be surrounded by greens, trees, and flowers. Our server Dave he was very attentive and gave out his good recommendations on drinks and daily specials.
For the food, I love the Dinner Rolls with butter on the side. I know it is a bit off to order breads and it‚Äôs not comes free. Trust me, they are worthy. 4 little squares buns they are fluffy and deliciously made to order hot üòå very yummy. I will order that every time I‚Äôm here. Steaks are pretty good quality AND taste, considering it‚Äôs not a steakhouse but it‚Äôs in line with most good steakhouses in town. Oysters were Raspberry Bay that day, very fresh. Dave told us about very soon they will have an oysters bar in the restaurant. Spring Leek Tart was beautiful to look at and delicious in mouth. I‚Äôm also in love with the Whole Branzino. It‚Äôs big and lay out like a butterfly, skin on top was cooked to crisp and fish was juicy and melted in mouth. It‚Äôs not fishy at all. Be careful there still little bonks in centre line of the fish. The cocktail menu was good and mix with top shelve booze. All and all, a very great experience and we are definitely going back for a steak dinner next time.
Price on a high side for sure, but considering the location (next to Rosedale Golf Club) and recently renovated + inflation like most restaurants we dined at‚Ä¶I understand.
Make sure you book for out door or upstairs Window balcony if you are making reservations, because those are very beautiful. I personally don‚Äôt like downstairs main dining room, even it‚Äôs renovated but I feel like a basement (no windows) to me.
If you like to just relax and have few drinks and nice meals in a beautiful setting, this is the place to be.",4
Wow! We were seated on the beautiful patio. The service was impeccable. All the food was delicious. Such a fabulous experience. A great way to kick off the summer. We took a peek at the newly renovated indoor dining rooms both upstairs and downstairs‚Ä¶beautiful.,4
"Lovely setting. You can easily forget you are a very short distance from major traffic. Good food. Attentive wait staff. A bit expensive, but the ambience and the good service make it worthwhile. We will be back.",3
We have been to the Millar so many times.  The patio is the perfect place to wind down after a long day. But the prices are really out of whack.  $30 for a glass of wine and $30 for a salad.  $32  for a burger.    As much as I like it I won‚Äôt be going back for a long while,3
"The service we received was extremely poorly!!!
Steaks not done right they were cold!
Waiting for the waiter to come to the table. Not friendly at all. It felt we were not welcomed at all!! Been there before and wanted my family to have the great experience we have had before! But this was truly a disaster! Had to apologize to my daughter for it was her birthday and she had come out with her 7 month baby! Not sure why but our guess is because we were seated inside???The manager was not helpful either. Replaced the steaks but now the sides were cold!!! No curtsy was shown nor were they apologetic!! I would think twice going there!!!üò°",1
"The food is exceptional, the menu variety is great and all the ingredients and premium and fresh. Service goes above and beyond to round out the experience, and the wine list is extensive. Patio is unlike any other in the area.",4
"Very nice place, good service, good food but expensive. Outdoor patio quite noisy.",3
"the service, amazing. the food, amazing. the place is STUNNING",4
"Very expensive, limited menu but quality is good.  Beautiful patio.  Wait staff is polished and knowledgeable.",3
Overpriced and conceited waiter.  But great food and  lovely patio,1
The music blasting thru the speakers was so loud - honestly made me wonder if you are now a bar instead of a restaurant ‚Ä¶ the menu was quite limited - I hadn‚Äôt realized it had changed so much,2
Food was good. Order was messed up. Food was returned and showed up again on the cool side. Credit was given for the food but I didn‚Äôt go to get a refund.,2
Very understaffed. Took 1//2 hour to have order taken ; 1/2 hour for one person to receive soup. After another 20 minutes asked where others‚Äô salads were. Told they were waiting for soup to be finished then served salads with main courses. Prices were ridiculous - 2 side shrimps cost $30 .  Very noisy. Bartender was hooting with customers. Very unpleasant. Used to enjoy this place. Won‚Äôt be back,1
I really like this spot. The food is good but the prices are getting worse. Today I had to specify the number of shrimp I wanted in my salad and each one was $6. That would have turned a $20 salad into a $45 salad if I choose a number greater than 4,4
I haven‚Äôt been to the Miller Tavern in over 5 years and it was so nice to be back,4
Offering filtered water than ‚Äòmunicipal‚Äô water would have improved our experience. But more attention to us also would have made the evening more enjoyable. An adjacent table with 5 people had the undivided attention of their server. Perhaps more servers were required or we didn‚Äôt appear to be as important. After ordering what we considered an expensive bottle of wine we had to pour it ourselves at one point.,4
Everything was great especially the service.  I would give 6 stars but they only let me give 5.,4
"Poor service, small portions, late sides (they came with the bill, rather then the entrees), and high prices combined for a disappointing Mother‚Äôs Day dinner.",0
"The reservation was for the main dining room, and we were sat in a private room, which was dated and not renovated. 
The staff and kitchen were overwhelmed with Mother's Day.  At 5:30 pm, they ran out of Burgers and had no Kid's menu available.  Considering the restaurant was FULL of families with children this was a major oversight in the company planning.",1
Honestly it is easily the best place in the area. Andrew - the manager - is great. Food is amazing and service is top notch. My wife and I now go every week. We took our kids on Mothers Day and they loved the burgers but loved the place as well. Reminds me of Soho House. 10/10,4
"I arrived to my reservation 10 minutes early. The man at the front informed me that I wouldn't start receiving service until my actual reservation, which is fine. Two tables sat after me. My reservation time comes around and no one greeted my table. However, the two tables that were sat after me were greeted. 20 minutes into my reservation, I still hadn't been greeted nor even poured water. The table behind me had already put in their drinks orders and were in the middle of ordering food. They had already received their apps by the time I was greeted. The service didn't apologize for not coming over. Our drinks (one cocktail and one water) took 15 minutes to come out. The food was nothing special, especially for the price point. We asked the server for more water 3 different times and she still forgot to bring it over. By the time she brought us water we were ready to leave. The pavlova was good and the only thing I actually enjoyed about the experience.",1
"Fabulous food and outstanding service! It was Mother's Day, so the place was packed. I was noisy but to be expected!",4
Food was brought out my steak was well done supposed to be medium rare was told 3 min to re cook another one wife finished her food my steak was still not brought out. Place is not the same will never return. Peter the server was extremely good but food was terrible,1
"We had an early Mothers Day dinner.  This time we sat in the newly renovated downstairs section.  The lighting was dark and uneven, felt like a rec room from the 70s.  It could be cozy in the winter, but definitely not inspiring on a sunny late spring day.

Our waitress was excellent ‚Äî cheerful, charming and professional.

The food was mediocre and overpriced.  4oz of salmon for $38, served medium-rare which meant essentially cool in the middle.  The pea coulis was more like a soup; the sugar snap peas were almost raw.  Top sirloin steak was cut very thick, not much seasoning, served rare; as a result, it was a bit tough and chewy.  Wagyu burger was rich, literally drenched in melted cheddar.

All in all, an underwhelming experience.  For the price, we could have had much better cuisine in a more inspiring environment.  The patio is gorgeous, might be worth a simple but expensive lunch now and then; but we‚Äôd avoid coming back to the basement.",2
Great lunch and amazing service. Everything was timed perfectly.,4
All good except took awhile for our orders to be taken‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll be back,3
"A perfect spot for an upscale lunch.
The main floor and outdoor patio are being renovated in early May, but it looks like things will be fully prepared for Victoria Day and afterwards.
The upstairs is in fine shape already!",4
"All was good, but don't tell your patrons your veranda is fully booked when it's not. We felt judged by the way we where casually dressed. This should never happen. Our waiter was very professional",4
Great service combined with supper food and ambience.,4
Really enjoyed our dinner at miller tavern. We sit at the window area and the view is beautiful.,4
"Very loud inside -in the future, we will stick to the outdoor patio",3
"As a regular visitor to Miller Tavern, I feel it's important to share my honest feedback about the place. The ambiance and environment here are consistently enjoyable, making it a good spot to hang out and unwind with friends. However, the overall experience can be hit or miss due to fluctuating service and food quality.

During my visit last week, my friends and I were greeted with a somewhat unprofessional and condescending tone. Our waitress referred to us as ""kids"" repeatedly, despite our casual attire. I understand that appearance isn't always indicative of one's age, but a bit more respect and decorum would be appreciated.

This week, I decided to give Miller Tavern another shot, hoping for an improved experience. Fortunately, the service was much better this time around, but I must admit that I was disappointed with the ribeye steak I ordered. It was an expensive cut, yet the quality didn't match up. A large portion of the steak was inedible due to tendons and fat, leaving me with only about one-third of the dish to enjoy. For the price, I expected more and have had better steak experiences with their lunch specials.

All in all, Miller Tavern can be a decent place to dine, but the inconsistency in service and food quality makes it hard to wholeheartedly recommend. With some improvements in these areas, I believe it has the potential to be a solid dining choice. Until then, it remains a three-star establishment in my book.",2
I found the food and service mediocre relative to the price charged. The beer selection was also mediocre.,1
Excellent service from our waiter and the food tasted amazing!!! So glad we spent our anniversary here (it was our first time at Miller Tavern @ York Mills). We will definitely be back!,4
"Everything was great, except for the long wait for the main course.

Very friendly and welcoming staff, great food and a beautiful ambiance. The newly renovated second floor is such an improvement!
Can not wait for the completion of the main floor.

Our waiter, James, made our evening very enjoyable, despite the wait.

Will be back for sure. üòä",4
Everything was perfect except of noisy annoying music,4
"Cobb salad - was so full in the small bowl it was impossible to mix. Would be better served in larger bowl or plate.  Also, too much blue cheese and bacon and needed more lettuce.",3
I had the grilled fish and broccolini.  The fish was perfectly cooked.  There was a little too much olive oil on the plate ‚Ä¶ a bit hard to digest when one doesn‚Äôt eat a lot of fat.  The broccolini wasn‚Äôt overcooked but it was difficult to eat.  Service and atmosphere were good.  However bottom line an expensive meal for me.,3
"We were delighted to once again be served by Kristey -- truly one of the best waiters we have ever encountered. Friendly, but not too much. Nice, but not cloying. Present, but not intrusive. Brilliant at anticipating needs, but never overbearing. Truly, a professional of the first order. 
Match that with excellent comfort food and an interesting and varied menu. What's not to love?",3
It was a good experience!! I would go there again in the future.,3
Very attentive wait staff. Varied lunch menu. Prices higher but understandable. Very nice meal. Not rushed.,4
"I will return when the renovations are complete, maybe in the Fall",3
"Wonderful renovations and the pal e looks amazing, can‚Äôt wait to see the first floor and patio when done.
Great food and very good service.  
I decided to have this restaurant as my meeting point when getting together with my friends . 
Thanks for a lovely time and such enjoyable menu .",4
"Great service. The waiter, Peter, was awesome. Great atmosphere and the food was delicious",4
"Everyone has to taste The Miller's risotto. It's great. The spring pea is good, but the mushroom is awesome!",4
We enjoyed our lunch and would definitely come back. Thanks,3
The Miller is a great spot to grab a delicious dinner in the hood. Highly recommend to anyone debating whether they should drive downtown for a night out or stay uptown. Stay uptown and go to the Miller!,4
The food for two people was not worth $180; the risotto was a big disappointment ; the salmon just ok and could have been a lot better for an overpriced restaurant. The  restaurant is definitely over priced; The Keg is a better deal ! Although your patio is nice and service is super friendly- the food needs to better quality and better variety is required!,0
We all had the steak special with choice of sides. Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly. We ended up on the patio and that was amazing,4
Nice to be back at the Miller Tavern.  It's been a while and we loved it.,4
"Good, with the potential to be great. Tough to work while construction going on in the main dining room.
Service was fine, but some improvements needed.
Prices were high.
Parking was an issue.
Noise an issue for conversation.
But I am a senior so maybe that‚Äôs a reflection of my age.
It is a happening place, so what the heck!
Rock on.",2
"Always an excellent meal with great food, an amazing ambience and an overall good vibe. The wine selection is quite extensive as well. 

The only thing I would be able to knit pick about this visit to Miller Tavern is the fact that they were out of several food items, which meant certain dishes on the menu were unavailable.",4
The burger and the crab cake were great. The caesar salad was one of the best I ever had.,3
"Service was great. Food good, but over priced. Almost 5$/oyster and $29 for a cobb salad. I like the reno. Envuronment was nice. Would I go back? Not unless I was going for a special  occasion or had an expense account.",3
"I am a regular customer.  Things are usually good.

This visit ‚Ä¶
Ordered steak.  Took a long time to get food.  Steak was not served hot.",2
My order was wonderful :crab cakes and ceasar salad but my friends onion soup was too salty she said. Dessert toffee sticky pudding out of this world!,4
We love the Miller it this time was a fail.  My martini was the smallest glass I‚Äôve ever seen and half full.  My husband birthday and he ordered a double scotch.  His glass was smaller than my water glass and we didn‚Äôt think it was a pour.  Tables beside and behind us has their phones rigging and talking loudly when they picked up.  Michelle was a great waiter and food was great.  Overall a disappointing and expensive night.,1
"The menu provided a variety of excellent dishes. Service was very welcoming, friendly and efficient.",4
Excellent as always,4
"It‚Äôs renovated very nicely but I think the prices are high for the meals. 

Also very noisy on the balcony",2
"The place is beautiful, the food was good and the service was fast and very attentive. Celebrating my wife's birthday and they were so nice to give us cake for the celebration.

Thank you",4
Very enjoyable. Food was lovely (a little slow) and the room was pretty. Service was great.,3
We love coming to Miller Tavern for our celebrations the food and service are always top notch !!,4
A bit pricey more than one expects. But food and ambiance are excellent. During weekends it‚Äôs crowded so perhaps that explains why servers sometimes are overwhelmed. Otherwise everything was very good.,3
"Great place, will definitely return. Our server Anna was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful with recommendations",4
No complaints.  Both the food and the service were excellent and we never felt rushed.  All good.,4
Lunch at the Miller was delicious as always.  The newly  renovated dining  area is beautiful.,4
"Fantastic mushroom risotto - amazing attentive service! And love the new renovated interior!

Way to go Miller Tavern - yummy food as always! Perfect location for business meeting",4
Portions are remarkably smaller than our last visit which was last week.,3
"Food and service was very good like last time. I have one small criticism- I wanted feta instead of blu cheese in a salad and was told that would be $3 extra. When you‚Äôre charging $30 already for a salad, perhaps this is overkill and not necessary. Just sayin.",3
"The new chairs in the dining area are very uncomfortable. Too many interruptions from the server. A little too noisy, we could have been seated in a quieter area. We were seated between 2 large parties.

The Moules were very good but Les Frites were soggy white potatoes.... very disappointing.

One of my favorite places to go but was not impressed last night.",3
"Delicious food, best tuna tartar in the city, hands down! Usually, a restaurant is good at one thing and the rest of the menu items are okay, more like filler so that they can show variety. But here, there is variety AND it‚Äôs all done incredibly well. It‚Äôs worth the 401 trek from Oakville to come here.",4
Noise level (acoustics) on the atrium makes it very difficult to have a pleasant conversion.  Would recommend eating indoors.,2
Food very good.  Service slow.  Had to ask for water and glasses never refilled,3
"The renovations upstairs are beautiful. Very mid century and fresh looking.  Green and browns with a brown and white marble tiled floor   Service was excellent as always. The food is fresh and delicious 
My friends and I have come here regularly for years 
Can‚Äôt wait to come back soon",4
Great service.  Fabulous food,4
Unfortunately your price are too high   That‚Äôs both food & alcohol,3
"Good, had halibut for dinner.  Could have used more flavouring/spices (not hot spices).

Other:  Please add a smaller ribeye to the menu.  20 oz is too big for one person.",3
Great food service and patio. Be back again real soon.,4
"Michael our server was very attentive and friendly. It was my spouse and I's, 11 year anniversary and we decided to try this place out for dinner. We ordered the tomahawk for two, with a dozen oysters to start. Tomahawk was super delicious and cooked well done to our liking. The oysters were from PEI and succulent as well. We ordered the creme brulee for dessert and even that was creamy and delicious. We definitely will be back again!",4
"Fantastic meal, service, ambiance. Thanks for a great night",4
We hadn‚Äôt been here in a long time.  Very happy we returned. The food for all four of us was delicious and perfectly prepared. Renovations are under way and the whole place is brighter.  Will definitely return.,4
As always food was great and met our expectations. Service was exemplary. We will be back soon!,4
"There are no breakfast type items on the menu such as Eggs Benedict which we had really wanted for Brunch.    Ordered the Reuben and it was delicious.
Wish they would bring back true Brunch items like eggs and french toast.",3
Great place for meeting up with friends and family - ambience amazing!,4
"Lunch at the Miller with a friend? Perfect! A menu that's hard to choose from because there are so many great options. (My guest said -- but I want to eat everything!) Wait staff (kudos especially to Kristie) who are friendly, professional, attentive at just the right moments without being oppressive. And a pleasant ambiance in the garden room with generous windows onto the outside world.",3
"The Village salad that I ordered consisted of 50 gram of lettuce (50 cents), 4 olives (20 cents) and 100 gr of a block of feta cheese on top - $5. The price for the salad is $25.
It tasted just like a raw lettuce from No Frills, but thank you for the cheap olives, they made it a bit better.
We had a very special occasion and were ok to spend and enjoy, so I didn't want to make a big deal about this. Disappoined.",2
Wonderful food and good service! We had a great time and for sure will be back!,4
Enjoyed the food and service. Currently under renovations. Looking forward to summer.,3
"The dining room is very attractive, but the seating on the bench couch is uncomfortable, and needs pillows. It is very expensive for what you get. My salad was heavy on lettuce, olives and feta (which was served as a slab)- light on anything else. My friends fish and chips were overcooked. The crab cakes did not have much crab. The service was professional, but not friendly. Overall, pretty, but poor value for the money. ($6 per medium sized shrimp - really?)",2
"Attentive service, nice ambience and quality food made it an enjoyable business lunch.",4
"Wonderful 60th Birthday dinner for my sister. Our server Paul was professional as well as having a great sense of humour.Food was out standing as well as wine suggestions. The desserts were delicious as well as beautiful to look at.
I will be back here again!",4
Recently renovated. Beautiful atmosphere to have a business lunch and or girlfriends getting together. Oysters are very fresh.,4
"Excellent food, beautiful restaurant, great drinks, kind staff. I did not get my waitress' name, but she was wonderful. I amcited to see what the place will look like after renovations are complete, and can't wait to dine here again during the nicer weather!",4
Valentines Day,3
I visit Miller Tavern often. Great food and service.,4
A bit overpriced. Oysters and steak were decent. Baked potato under seasoned. Risotto was average.,3
Medium rare steak was overcooked and then very rare when brought a replacement. The manager was not helpful and the service was very slow. Not a great dining experience‚Ä¶,0
"The menu is reliably interesting while also offering perfect comfort food. Our waiter‚Äîwho has served us before ‚Äî is absolutely perfect at her job ‚Äî anticipating our needs without ever being intrusive . The Miller is a wonderful, reliable place to eat and meet.",4
"James was an amazing waiter
Very tentative
Exceptionally pleasant
Richard",4
The food for both of our entrees was sub par.,1
"Fish and chips for lunch, more expensive than most other places but quality and taste were just average.",3
"Made a last minute decision to dine here for dinner. What a great choice. Our waiter knew the menu well and provided excellence service. We started with cocktails and the charcuterie board, followed by the halibut. Incredible meal & id highly recommend. Note that it‚Äôs not a huge menu but I think options for most diets.",4
"Fantastic meals served by Michael! Presentation perfect and attentive service. Impromtu Birthday dinner for 60yr old! Great time with friends! We will be back.
Was here 35 years ago...happy to see the renovations!",4
Short Ribs were not cooked long enough. The other dishes were fine,3
Incredible service . Food was amazing . First time there and I will definitely go back . Highly recommend,4
"I used to come here often and it was good value and a fun atmosphere.  Now the food is ridiculously overpriced ($95 steaks at The Miller???), the food quality is poor (cold fries - twice, a very average burger), and the atmosphere is lacking.  It is aiming to be a fine dining restaurant, but it takes more than ridiculously high prices to merit that label.  I will not be going back.",0
Restaurant is under renovation so doesn't look great now. However food was excellent and service very good. Definitely upgrading to even better restaurant!,4
Old School Spot with good vibes and good grub.  Always good experience.  Look forward to bottom half opening.  Hoping there is nice bar  as part of the renos.,4
"I have to say we got the best service from David, he was nice and prepared a birthday cake to my birthday girl:) He is sweet. Also, there is another fun server who took a picture to us and left his selfie in my phone. 
The most important thing is the food quality is also the best. I will be a loyal customer at here:). 
To sum up, it is the best place to date with my girl.",4
excellent spot. Perfect for a business lunch,4
One of my favorites‚Äô,4
Nice ambiance. Service excellent. Menu overpriced. $22 for a salad exorbitant!,2
"Amazing experience!
James provided the best service! Food and wine was outstanding.
We love coming to the Miller. Never disappointed!
Waihlid is always attentive and friendly. Thanks!!Esther and Bruce",4
"The food was awesome. We really enjoyed the burger, crab cake, NY steak, trio chocolate cake and mango Gelato. Service and vibe was also fantastic. Would definitely recommend",4
We were there on Tuesday January 3. Our waitress Anna was outstanding!  She always makes sure we have everything we need and is very attentive.  We will be coming back soon!!,4
This spot was super cozy with lots of dining space. The staff were helpful and the food was amazing. The portions were very large and definitely worth the money. We will absolutely return for another special occasion!,4
"We enjoyed our birthday dinner in the enclosed balcony,which the location and ambience was great
The short rib was great the steak was underdone.  To bad no lamb anymore 
Service and cleanliness was goo",3
The renovated section is quite lovely.  It was noisier in the inner dining hall which made it difficult to hear but we asked to be seated in the balcony which ended up being perfect.  Service was superb!,3
Nice quiet environment with friendly staff and excellent food. Perfect for lunch meetings.,4
"Went to have lunch with my friend to celebrate the holiday. I chose to be seated in the balcony area (enclosed). even though it is winter, the areas did not feel cold, it was a bright and cheerful space.

We had ahi tuna, shrimp cocktail, crab cake, salad, steak frites, I enjoyed every dish, and could taste the fresh and quality ingredients.

Michele was helpful , cheerful, and making our visit even more enjoyable.

The place was quiet so my friend and I could have an easy time catching up (nowadays not easy to find a place with good food, beautiful decor and quiet enough to have a good conversation)

Highly recommend.",4
Great place for a business lunch. Portobello mushroom burger was exceptionally good.,4
"Service was great. Food delicious. Ambience festive, reflecting the season. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.",4
"Few things on the menu was not available, and we we were told only after we submitted our order, for example there was no bake potatoes and no lobster tail, and to top it all off the pasta was very salty,  a bit too much salt for our tasting.. thank you for asking",2
Very  good place to meet with friends. Good parking.,3
Out with friends!,4
"A reliable upscale neighborhood pub.

Food was comparable to a fine dining establishment.  Excellent wine selection.  Tasty cocktails.  Big shout out to the bar!

Very good service.",4
It was a nice place with good service and an excellent atmosphere.,3
"good environment for a group of people, or just 2 people.  Staff are courteous and helpful.",3
"The renovations to the Miller Tavern are nice. Still, by no means elegant, modern or a representation of an expensive metropolitan city higher-end restaurant, The items on the menu are priced like any expensive restaurant, such as Morton's Steak House, The Chase, and Biff's Bistro. However, Miller Tavern's food is less than mediocre. You can charge high prices, but your quality and experience must match. The restaurant was busy, but it shows you that there are people who will pay for a false image and average cuisine.",1
"Everything was good but expensive.  Service in all departments was great, Cocktails could of use a little more alcohol, couldn't taste any per $16.00 + per drink. I asked for my steak rare, I got it very blue. Server said it was rare, little did she know that one of my guest was a chef @ a highend restaurant. LOL  

2 bottles of wine, with drinks and food $830.00 plus 20% tip= $996.00 for 4 of us.

Overall good, but much nicer steak places for the same money.",2
"Food great, service really good, parking available (free and very affordable), great ambience. Will be going there again",4
"Positive experience overall however, too expensive for what you receive!",2
"Loved the experience, hadn‚Äôt been there in ages. Staff were so helpful, friendly and accommodating. Food was delicious!!! Thank you for a great evening",4
I was disappointed that the Cobb salad at $29 contained a pile of squash and NO avocado.,2
"I love gathering at this venue. The upstairs was really nice. We were a large group seated next to the bar and it took so long to receive water or drinks. 

I hope for a more positive experience next time.",2
"As always, the ambiance on the veranda during lunch time was great, so was the food - the tuna tartare and the branzino were superb, flavourful and tender! Very attentive service, the background music is a nice touch. If any improvements I would suggest, is on the timing of the food - it took a while to get it. Also, we noticed the smell of the kitchen this time, possibly coming from downstairs of the veranda. Thank you for all your attention to detail.",3
"My friend and I had lunch yesterday and we were very disappointed.  The service was poor.  We each ordered an appetizer and a side dish to share.  The side dish of greens did not come until after we finished our other food although it was promised momentarily a few times.  Then we shared a dessert, choc mousse which was just OK.    I will say my squash tarte and my friends crab cakes were very good.  We each had coffee.  Then the bill came and it was $98.00.  We were shocked.  I know prices have gone up but for what we had this was crazy.  I should have not left the tip I did.
Sorry but we will avoid returning for the time being.",2
"Halibut dish was below par.  For the price, I expected a filet rather than chunks hidden in a sauce.  Potatoes were hard and undercooked which our server acknowledged when I told her but that‚Äôs as far as it went - I expected she might bring out the chef to enquire or perhaps a complimentary coffee or desert.   In the end server seemed unimpressed when she took back my half eaten meal.   Noise level was shockingly loud‚Ä¶‚Ä¶for the price this lunch experience fell far short of the mark.   Too bad.  Miller used to always be a 5 out of 5‚Ä¶‚Ä¶even at these prices.",1
"Excellent services and polite staff.
The meals are well presented and taste great.",4
"We LOVE coming here! Great food, wonderful staff, beautiful atmosphere - just about the perfect place for a lovely evening out especially if we don't feel like driving downtown.... but have to be downtown for the ballet or the theatre (since the restaurant is literally minutes away from York Mills subway station).  Highly recommend!",4
Great  excellent food fantastic server excellent overall. Will return,4
Have difficulty with your lunch menu. Ordered club sandwich. It‚Äôs NOTHING like a club sandwich. Just two big slabs of WHITE bread with a slice of bacon and some overdressed chicken. What happened to a triple decker on thin brown bread!! More soup and salad and sandwich options would suit me better. Service gracious and fast. Music too loud.,3
A great evening. Good food and ambiance.,4
"Phenomenal experience, service was top notch. Over delivered on my expectations!",4
"It was a lovely holiday lunch with my goddaughter. Our waitress was charming and helpful (willingly running downstairs to check my coat for me ‚Äî I hadn‚Äôt been asked by the host if I wanted to do so before he led us upstairs). The food was superbly prepared. The garden balcony area has been beautifully renovated. I only wish we‚Äôd been offered a more comfortable table / seating. But I suppose the resto was hoping to fill larger tables (can‚Äôt blame them, but, on the other hand we HAD made reservations well in advance and in the end at least two tables set for four were only occupied by duos).",3
Seems like a good place for a work dinner. Our server must have been busy because she almost seemed annoyed with us. However another server was pleasant and helped our table. The upstairs looked nice with the renovations. Excited to see them transform the entrance.,2
"More expensive since 1 year ago!
Items double in costs which was a bit of a shocker!!!",2
"Decent food, somewhat overpriced. Very loud. Staff always friendly.",3
"I hadnt visited the Miller since it was under new ownership a few years ago.  On the day we went for lunch, it was very busy with many groups having Christmas get-togethers.  Regardless, the service was excellent and timely, and the food was very good.  We had oysters, beef tartare, tuna tartare and the halibut.  all of it was very good and fresh. I will be back!!",4
Always dependable. Nice atmosphere with recent upgrades.,3
"Our food was great, the servicer was outstanding. The area brings back great memories for me. I also found a full range menu was presented. I would highly recommend the Miller for a causal or formal meal setting.",4
The food was very good. Lots of variety on the menu. Excellent  service. Lots of parking.,4
Great food and service.  Thank you very much.  Had to pay for parking.,4
Very noisy making it a challenge to hear my luncheon companion.  Prices too high for quality of food.  Excellent service.,2
"Server waqs very good. Unfortunately my meal was cold, our server took carte of it quickly and was very apologetic. Had a great time with friends and enyoyed our meal.",4
"I've usually had really great experiences at Miller Tavern over the years. However, my most recent visit for a client holiday lunch was disappointing. Our waiter was quite aloof, unfriendly, and didn't make us feel welcome what so ever. Through all of this, the service was also incredibly slow. I actually had three clients that needed to take their lunches to go so they could make it to the next meeting. My trust in this establishment has been shaken and I'm now on the look out for a new go-to.",1
Our server suggested the Sunday night roast beef special be shared . 2 servings more that enough for 4 of us. Excellent service and food.  A bit on the pricey side but great value.,4
"Balcony was not as quiet as inside (we were inside last time - nice - quiet).
Service was a little bit slow.
Food was good but it took a long time to order it.
The bill never arrived at the table - had to request it.
Desert was fantastic - our occasion was a double birthday - thanks for that!",1
"Great food, excellent service.  Very accommodating for a your baby with us. Nothing was a problem.  Highly recommend.",4
"Food was delicious, service was great and they gave my father-in-law a complimentary dessert for his birthday. We‚Äôll be back!",4
An excellent experience. Attentive service and a great meal. Definitely in the expensive side.,4
Great ambiance with delicious food! The staff was also very friendly and accommodating.,4
"Amazing food (Tavern Burger and Reuben), truly sensational service. The Miller continues to be one of my favourite restaurants.",4
"I had been a regular Miller North York customer for years prior to the pandemic with dependably good experiences in both food and service and decent value for money. Post pandemic though I have been twice in the last few months, most recently yesterday, to see if my disappointing prior experience in June 2022 (at best mediocre food, good service but very high prices/poor value) had been an anomaly or the new normal.  Unfortunately it seems things have deteriorated since my visit in June. This time although our server was very cordial and attentive the food was a very long time coming and when it did arrive the food was at best extremely ordinary. My $48.00 pasta dish was smothered in half melted cheese (CHEESE ON SEAFOOD PASTA? A TRAVESTY) and only lukewarm suggesting it had been sitting under a heat lamp for an extended period. My wife‚Äôs $28.00 burger was drowned in some sort of sauce rendering the bun and lettuce garnish more or less inedible. She did say her fries were nice and hot but also smeared in truffle oil which wasn‚Äôt a big plus. With a bottle of fairly pedestrian wine and three menu items between us the bill was $186.00. Slow delivery of very mediocre food and very high prices are not a combination that represents good value by any measure. You can do better in this area for a lot less money.",1
"We love the Miller Tavern, but find the verandah too noisy at lunch.  The food is terrific.",2
"Very pleasing environment. Good good and good service
The enclosed patio are is very nice",3
Out with friends,4
AlwaYs like the Millers.  The renovations to the vets dah look great.  Your prices have gone up a lot which makes dining at Millers a lot more expensive than it was.,4
"We were at the Yonge Street location. The combination of the ambiance, an excellent server and delicious food made for a wonderful evening. I can't call out the service enough as James was thoughtful, knowledgable, and attentive.  Highly recommend.",3
Menu was limited for lunch on Sunday. Would have thought they'd have a more varied menu.,3
"Great waiter, fantastic experience and tasty food!",4
"Very noisy
Prices getting very high
Awesome Cobb salad
Our server was nice",4
"Great service by Anna Maria, friendly staff excellent food. The chef‚Äôs special pate was outstanding as was my main!
See you soon when back in Toronto!
Rick",4
The Cobb salad was the best I‚Äôve ever had and the service was outstanding.,3
"Front reception was courteous and quick. Service was excellent. The food was excellent also. First time i have been back to the (Jolly) Miller Tavern in 40 years, it was worth the wait, haha.",4
"Very slow service. Asked for items (cheese, drinks) that never came. Scaled down menu, limited choice.",1
"This was my third time eating there and even though I wasn't impressed the previous times i booked it again 
French onion soup was dark and burned and almost no onion. tasted like if they just used pure Worcestershire sauce as broth.
Main course, halibut, came in creamy sauce, not too bad but in my opinion halibut dish should be clean and simple. The skin was too dry and overdone.
Side dish. Brussel sprouts, a bit overcooked, glaze was too sweet and didn't feel like having a healthy vegetable anymore.
My friend's hamburger was too greasy. The combination of fatty wagyu beef. Caramelized onion, fried mushrooms, cheese and freid bun on top was too heavy.",2
Very nice experienceVERY expensive!,4
"Steak was over cooked. Mains came too fast after appetizer. Not happy with food value. Service was ok but not for
The price. Again very disappointing.",1
The food here is always good. There is lots of choice and the choices always deliver! Service is consistently good. This visit was for lunch where one can choose from either a lunch menu or the full dinner menu.,3
"As a frequent visitor to this restaurant, I can give it a high rating in terms of food quality, comfort and service.  Special thanks for the opportunity to make table reservations online.",4
Great food & service. They also make the best mango sorbet.,3
"I liked the drapes as the atmosphere was homier.

Food was delicious as usual.

Since I am old, I would appreciate more sound absorption so it's easier to hear people talking.

Always enjoy my visits here.",4
"Great service, nice quiet private atmosphere.
Steak was mediocre especially for the price.",2
We had a great dining experience. We shared a branzino along with Caesar salad and two sides. It was perfect. Our server Eric was exceptional with his service and personality. Walleed the manager is always on top of things and very courteous. We will be back soon. Well done.,4
"Service and food are amazing. From the moment we walked in until the very end of our meal, the staff has been attentive and friendly. I had a small spill on my white top and one of the servers just appeared with club sofa and napkin for me. I don‚Äôt know how he heard or saw it but I was really impressed. 

All of our meals were delicious especially the desserts (sticky toffee pudding was the crowd fave) but everything was soo good.",4
"We have been guests of The Miller many times over many years. We were not aware that the downstairs area was closed for renovation. Nor were we aware that they no longer serve brunch. Our food was good...up to the usual standard, but our server was quite indifferent (if not openly grouchy.) The second floor dining room is very non-descript. We felt we could have been in a corporate hotel dining room anywhere in the world. No character. We will not be going back.",1
Good food good service wine is expensive nice interior,3
Food was excellent.  The waiter we had was fantastic!  Great lunch!,4
Very nice evening and meal. Charging for bread is not acceptable.,4
"We enjoyed the evening but were disappointed by two menu items. The escargots were rather drab. The sauce was lacking in flavour and as well as lacking in the serving amount. The small dish probably accounted for this. There was bread for dipping but the was nothing to dip it into.
The shortribs were a challenge. They came in a bowl atop a mound of mash potatoes making them very difficult to cut as they sank into the bowl. The person who ordered this dish basically gave up and didn't bother to eat this meal.",3
"I was surprised by the renovations and that the bar will be closed for more than 6 months .. Food was good, the service was excellent, pricing was excessive .. not sure you needed to raise the prices as much as you did .. hopefully, all areas commented on will improve in the future .. you have a wonderful location and have always been a go-to place for me when I am in the area .. All the best !!",3
I am a regular customer and I found that the experience was as good as in the past. I will continue to consider Miller Tavern for future dining.,3
"Excellent spot, the food was amazing! All staff very friendly! One of our favourites thank you",4
Food was good. Service was very slow and the server seemed overwhelmed.,2
We arrived around 6:30pm it wasn‚Äôt busy the service was great at that time. We ordered our food around seven and didn‚Äôt receive all of it had to ask for the rest and look for a waiter for drinks.the rest of our food came around 8:15 and by then after waiting an hour we weren‚Äôt very hungry. Service was sub par.,2
"Very enjoyable spot for a weekend lunch. We had the fish & chips, chicken club, cobb salad and reuben on rye. All food was excellent and large portions. Excellent attentive service.",4
Fantastic food and service,4
Great food & service. Also located beside a Toronto Green P for additional parking if restaurant parking lot is full.,4
Service was professional. Food quality was excellent. Timing of food preparation and service was very efficient.,4
"Short rib was just OK, everything else was fairly good",3
"We booked for my wife's birthday as she loves the ambiance of the lower level tavern portion. Under renovations - no worries it happens.
Lead upstairs and seated. 15 minutes for drink orders to be taken, when they arrive at least 10 minutes later they are incorrect.
Then we were essentially forgotten for a good 15-20 minutes. Until (not our waiter) comes over and asks if we had ordered mains as our menus were still in front of us. I informed her that we had not even ordered appetizers a this point and were feeling a tad forgotten. 50 minutes after arrival our appetizers arrive and were delicious. The rest of the evening was very similar forgotten and served by someone who was clearly not our waiter. Disappointing experience for my wife and her birthday celebration. The food was still great and the cake and prosecco for the birthday was a nice touch but too little too late.",0
"Haven't been since the upstairs was renovated.  Lovely looking but a bit louder than I remember.  Perhaps the new wall/ceiling/floor materials are amplifying the sound. Music sounded almost too loud for conversation in the indoor area but where we were on the inclosed balcony was fine.  Food was delicious, but a bit pricy.  Maybe it's just the cost of inflation.",3
"Our group of 5 enjoyed our meals, service and overall experience but the Seafood Linguine contained very little seafood, and in general everything is overpriced.",4
"Amazing place , few times we have been there this year , we love it , food taste is great , service is unbelievable, I highly recommend it , plenty of parking .",4
Waiter did not come to ask us how our food was. Fish and chips not tasty or fresh,0
They have refurbished a part of the restaurant and the ambience is very nice. Only complaint I would have is that the mussel dish I have most mussels were empty and the ones that had meat in them the meat was the size of a peanut!!...disappointing when The Miller has always been well know in the neighbourhood as a great value for money place and for great food! Left starving!,3
It was great and thanks for moving our table,4
Seated at enclosed windowed patio area. Noise was so great that it was difficult to have a relaxed conversation with my lunch companion. It spoiled my visit. Also am shocked by the increased prices for menu items. Both factors lead me to look for other lunch options. I was very unhappy about the noise and told our server about it. She suggested we seat ourselves inside in future which didn‚Äôt address my complaint. I‚Äôve been a regular client but I will be avoiding Miller Tavern in future.,2
"My 3rd visit in 2 weeks. Excellent service and best Cobb salad ever!
I will return ofter",4
Great neighbourhood gem! Great for celebrations and enjoying great food and company.,3
"Service is excellent, but very high prices for what it is.  $32 for fish and chips or $18 for French Onion Soup?  Really?  A $250 lunch for 3 people at a glorified ""pub"" is rather excessive.",2
"I was very disappointed in the new menu .
Very expensive with very limited choices 
It has always been our favourite place to eat when meeting friends from out of town 
We were all more than disappointed that you have reduced your menu to a 
Very few expensive dishes 
The cob salad came in a bowl that was too small  our server was excellent but didn‚Äôt make up for the other issues 
I notice this is a common complaint 
Hope you take notice and have a more extensive menu 
We always loved your fish tacos !!",2
"Three of us stopped by in October 2022.  The food is delightful - three of us shared the Jolly Miller charcuterie plate, PEI mussels and a mushroom risotto along with a nice Italian red wine. Many items were market priced, steaks started at 75$ while mains were in the 28-49$ range. The wine list is interesting with a decent price range. Service was excellent; decor was stylish - I would bring clients here. You will get an excellent meal, at Bay street prices, great if you have deep pockets or are on an expense account.  It would be lovely to think of the Miller Tavern as a local neighbourhood bistro to stop by for a meal anytime but the price points makes it a business or classy event destination - at least for me. 

The Miller Tavern is currently undergoing renovations downstairs. I'll be keen to see what they do there. It is located in Hog's Hollow, has free parking; is just below the 401 and Yonge and is close to the Yonge and York Mills subway line.",3
"Used to be one of our favourite neighbourhood hangouts. Now, it‚Äôs not worth it at all. 

The meal was overpriced and terrible. I compared one of their steaks to the Keg and it‚Äôs $30 more for the same cut 10oz steak. My steak was so poorly prepared I retired it after a few bites. They didn‚Äôt ask why nor did they offer to replace it, take it off the bill or even offer free dessert in lieu of the bad meal. Really disappointed. 

Save your money and your time. Time to find another neighbourhood restaurant.",0
Excellent food and good ambiance.  Good service but a little pricey,4
"Such a beautiful restaurant
Steak was the best I‚Äôve had in a very long time
Staff was so personable and efficient",4
"Food was a bit pricey.  More than 30 dollars for one piece of fish abd chips - lots of chips.  And coffee was $5.00!  
The ambience service was great.",3
Great meal.  Super service.  Great atmosphere. We would definitely go again.,3
"We love this place. And the remake after the Covid made it fabulous!

But the menu is too restricted, and not priced accordingly..",2
Great meal and service. Thank you for ensuring a good experience,4
Poor service and disappointed in food quality. $80 steak was overdone and dry,2
The renovations are amazing and the food has levelled up! Had a fabulous lunch with the family. Highly recommend,4
"Great  service. 
Interesting but restrictive menu. 
In my experience, food not worthy of price. Preferred former menu and flavourful, varied selections and price points.
Too noisy to have a real conversation in the main dining room.
Unfortunate because it was once one of my favourite places.",2
"Food, service and ambience at the Miller have been great for years - we have been coming here for over 20 years. The only (minor) complaint is that when I tried to book using their online service, I could only book the patio - not a great choice for October. When I called to correct that, my confirmation email still said ""patio"". We were placed inside, but you should fix that.",4
Lovely new venue upstairs but the prices were quite high ($70 and up to ‚Äúmarket price‚Äù) for a steak dinner. Other options were more reasonable. Service was a little over the top- in an effort to please we felt a little swarmed at times. I would come back but would review the menu and prices first.,2
Very good night out. Food was tasty as always. Service with a smile from every staff member.,4
80th Birthday celebration for a member of a running group that started nearly 50 years ago.  Server was excellent and amiable. Food was very good and hot. Nice touch with a ‚Äúsurprise dessert‚Äù for the birthday boy.,4
Miller Tavern has changed their seating structure to accommodate Covid.   Before they had cozy banquets.  Now it‚Äôs very open leaving it with a cold and empty ambience.,3
"Unfortunately, two of our favourite dishes have been taken off the menu; namely, the lobster sandwich and the shrimp rosti. The fish and chips are exceptional.",3
"I miss the old Jolly Miller. The renovated premises is lovely and the food excellent, but the prices came as a bit of a shock.",3
"Really impressed with the renovations that have been done. Dining area was great, comfortable and easy to have a conversation. I will be back",3
"The service was not so great. We ordered 2 different Martinis and it was served to the wrong people. I ordered a lychee martini and my friend different one.
Only after we tasted we realized that I got my friends and she got my.
We didn't say anything, but we are not happy.
I just like your place for location and menu and visited on many occasions with or without reservations. Also, for business functions with some financial institutions.
Improvement in service is needed",2
"Very expensive but enjoyed food , room and service.   Alcohol costs were very high",2
"This was our first visit in the renovated dining room and it was certainly worth the wait.  Not only is the new dining area absolutely beautiful, but the whole dining experience has been elevated!  The menu has changed with so many new items.  And the service was exceptional!  Our food was served quickly, done right and delicious!  Can‚Äôt wait to go back!",4
"Great food but more importantly, Anna was an outstanding waiter. Went above and beyond for us and our kids n",4
"We enjoyed the most delicious, fresh oysters followed by steak tartar with a bottle of bubbly. We were graciously attended to by Miller staff. Highly recommend this resto!",4
"Perfect stunning heated patio, sliding rooftop- marble fire place. The entire staff were so welcoming.  Super attentive and professional.  

Food was delicious and all our allergies were noted by the team. Will be back to try indoor dining for dinner! 

An Oasis in North York!",4
"First time visiting. A beautiful place (the garden or the veranda) for a casual Saturday lunch. Food was quite delicious. Each dish has its unique profile and our server was great. The only downside was the hostess because the manner in which we were shown to our table wasn‚Äôt welcoming.  Our reservation for 2 was at 12 noon and I specified outside seating when I booked. There was only 1 other table of 4 at the restaurant when we arrived. All the 2-seater tables on the veranda were available. However, we were shown to a table adjacent to the opening of the staircase of the entrance to the indoor dining room. That would be the last table anyone would want. I asked to be seated outside in the veranda, reminding the hostess I specified it on my booking.  She hesitantly took us to a table in the veranda. I am curiously about the reason behind the offering of the table near the staircase. I will go dine at this place again. If this happens again, I will ask for an explanation next time.

Interesting note: When we left, there was 1 table dining in the indoor dining room. It was an Asian family. And yes, I am Asian.",0
Loved it! Amazing atmosphere and gorgeous interior.,4
"I was so disappointed that we couldn't eat on the patio yesterday. It was a beautiful day. When I booked the table, I requested patio. When I confirmed the day before, the confirmation was for patio. When I got a call the morning of our much anticipated luncheon/reunion, I specifically said PATIO. At no time, was I told the patio was closed. This was very disappointing since we are seniors (young seniors) and concerned about safety. The server was great! The price of the food seems to have gone up considerably in the past year. I understand inflation, but it seemed to be over and above. $4.50 for a cup of tea seems excessive. It was extremely noisy (one reason for the patio request) and hard to hear.",2
"The Miller Tavern is a good restaurant. Not great or outstanding but good. The prices are pretty eye-watering - $36 for a Chicken pot pie? Really, the food is no better than the Duke of Kent or other pubs. The service was excellent. Major beef: the music out of the ceiling speaker was stupidly loud. The server did arrange to kill the volume from 11 to a much better 2. But the thing is - why should I have to ask for this? I don't go to a restaurant for music - I go for the food. Perhaps a misguided attempt to set the mood? Well, doesn't work. The management should know this without patrons having to ask to having the volume turned down.",2
"I had been to the Miller Tavern several times before and always had a great meal and experience, but this time was not one of those times. My lunch appointment with clients started at 12:30 PM, but we only received our meals at 1:45 PM.

The wait staff said that there was a large party of 40 people that they were catering to, but that should not have taken away from our meal being served in a timely manner. Even little things like having our water refilled were not done for more than one hour!

I will seriously have to think about whether I return to the Miller Tavern based on how poor the service was. The fact that one single drink was comped in order to make up for the lack of service, and the huge delay in the meal certainly did not make up for the overall experience. It‚Äôs unfortunate how one experience like this, can change my perception of the Miller Tavern overall.",1
Food is amazing but the dining experience isn‚Äôt well. They took me to the wrong table that I booked then the waiter isn‚Äôt offer good services.,2
Really slow service. Server was friendly enough but he was not good at his job. Food was ok. Music was too pumped for weekday lunch crowd. I've been here many times before and it was much better. But not so much today.,1
"Very nice location, the food and service is very good.
Could offer a few more less expensive wines.",3
"Have been to the restaurant three times this week...Monday sat outside in the patio with heaters, second day in the lovely covered enclosed porch and today inside the restaurant.  First two times wonderful service, food and ambience....today very poor service- understaffed, noisy- asked them to turn down the music...said they couldn't as it was preset and they couldn't give us separate bills (table of 6).  With technology its so easy to do separate bills so we got one bill split 6 ways and we each paid separately.  Also no fresh air flow sitting inside.  They could easily have sat us outside as same service.  It was a disappointing end of a three day run at this restaurant.  Our waiter told us he typically has 6 tables but had 15 tables!  Had to keep asking for water, coffee etc.   As a goodwill gesture for the poor service and wait, they could have offered a free coffee/dessert/discount etc.  as we didn't receive full service.",3
"Certainly a big change from ""the Jolly Miller""  A sophisticated dining experience.

It is pricey .... but the experience is worth it.",4
"Server was disorganized, got orders mixed up and forgot an order.  Also, spilled wine on my guest‚Äôs dress and cashmere scarf and didn‚Äôt even offer any compensation! The server disappointed the experience.",3
No vegan choices. Very unusual for a nice red these days,4
Great experience. Always love visiting The Miller. We were celebrating our anniversary and were so surprised when our waiter brought us a lovely dessert - on the house!!!  Our dinner was delicious and the service was great!,4
"Overpriced for the setting 
Service was lacking, very very slow, waiter forgot to bring items ordered, had to be reminded a couple of times",3
"Loved our experience at Miller Tavern. It was my son's birthday and we had a group of 8 on the patio. The ambiance on the patio is fabulous: Beautiful furniture, nice flowers and greenery, nice table settings. The service was also EXCELLENT; friendly but not too much; good recommendations. Felt really special for a nice occasion but also could be really casual. Only downside is that it's a tad expensive, but it Toronto so we are used to it. Two thumbs up. Will definitely be going back soon.",4
"Excellent service, food and wine.",4
"Excellent restaurant !
Always love to dine there with business colleagues or friends and family",4
"Service was incredibly slow. Took along time to get our starters. 
The barata salad was a good but a lot smaller than I remember 
Prices were way up and  food was ok. 
Patio is outstanding. So beautifully done",3
We asked for specific omissions from our lobster sandwich and those were respected fully and with pleasure; the sandwiches were excellent.  Waiter was attentive without being overbearing. The patio setting is truly glorious - one of the best in the city. Can't wait to return.,4
"My wife and I decided in our anniversary we wanted to go to a different restaurant this year. We choose Miller Tavern. The settings or ambiance was very nice. They gave and option of dining in there warm outside patio, or inside. We choose to dine inside. Our waiter was prompt. Served us coffee. We ordered appetizers (Caesar salad) . The Caesar salad was very good. Our expectation for the main course was high. I ordered the angus steak my wife ordered the tender loin  with fries. Our meal came. To our disappointment the fries where cold, and the quantity that was given was for a toddler . Our waiter was prompt in replacing the fries. Our steaks had no season on it whatsoever. We asked for salt to add a bit of seasoning. They gave out the salt shaker with no salt. My wife and I decided to take the steak home and season ourselves, since we paid close to a hundred each. The waiter asked us if we wanted dessert at which point we said no, ( We went to Symposium for dessert , we know we will get what we pay for.) Overall you are paying for the ambiance, 1 good waiter, not the quality of food.",1
We had a successful working lunch.  Christine was attentive and respectful of our business first then we enjoy lunch.,4
"Loved everything about the Miller, except a little pricey.",3
"Service and food was excellent.  A bit more expensive than I remembered previously.  Value was pretty good, but the add-on charges were a bit much (e.g. $7 for dinner rolls).",4
Excellent atmosphere and service however the Menu is very strange collection of mismatched cuisine.    The prices are way over the top ‚Ä¶especially the wine where a $25 bottle of Decoy is $110.    Not worth it at all.,1
"Our server was excellent and the patio was lovely, but that‚Äôs where the positive experience ended. The lobster sandwich was a huge disappointment!  Alongside a bowl of salad that was good,  the sandwich consisted of thickly sliced brioche bread, a slice of tomato, a leaf of lettuce, barely one  slice of bacon and a meagre amount of rubbery/tough lobster hardly worth calling it a lobster sandwich.  Unbelievable and outrageous to charge $38 for it!  I won‚Äôt be back there again.",2
Beautiful patio.  Charging for dinner rolls  on a menu is a bit chinzy in our opinion. Also 14$ for a baked potato side seems a bit much. P,3
"Awesome service and exceptional overall lunch experience.  
The food was awesome.  Also really liked the recently renovated dining room.   Miller never disappoints.",4
"The most beautiful patio, very good service. We were two, for dinner. Some food was good, some ok. The Cobb salad was excellent. Deserts were very bad, especially considering the price. Even an ice cream, surprisingly very bad. We would return, but will skip the desert.",3
"Lovely spot for a celebration or fancy night out. Terrific, attentive service and beautiful ambiance. Would be back.",4
"We have been to The Miller many many times and have to once again say how great the food was and attentive the staff .

This time we were once again on the patio which looks beautiful with the twinkle lights, however, the music was far too loud and people were competing to be heard

The musical selections were odd this time.  Not conducive to dining.",3
"Food is always good however portions are on the smaller side and there should be more vegetarian, vegan type options.",2
"Excellent food, atmosphere and service..  Quiet even though we were outside by Yonge St",4
Felt very rushed to leave the table as the waiter kept mentioning the time and that we needed to leave by the allotted time slot. But the restaurant was empty with no one there so it awkward since he kept reminding us every 15 min even though we had 1 hours left.,3
"Excellent food, service & particularly ambience.
Somewhat over priced",3
The place is coming together!! Patio is lovely. Try the Wagu burger it was absolutely delish.,4
"Late summer patio experience was good. Only mild disappointment was service was a bit slow and forgetful. Still recommend menu, ambience, and value.",3
Very impressed ! Nice ambiance and space and comfort ! Super drinks and dining !,4
We found that the service was very good but the food was of second rate quality. The meat was tough and overcooked (not medium as we requested). The prices were outrageously high for what we got.,2
"The patio is beautiful as always. Our server was excellent and accommodated my requests with a smile.

Unfortunately, it breaks my heart to order a Wagyu burger that is medium well instead of medium rare.

I understand there are health regulations to follow but it is an enjoyable treat to go anywhere in the US and order a juicy medium rare burger without any issue.

My burger could have been run-of-the-mill ground beef for all I could tell - at a very expensive cost of $29.00.

Overall, the patio and service are worth the trip. Maybe just stick to salads and French Onion soup or charcouterie.",2
The meal was better than we expected.  The noise was from the main road but made the patio less peaceful. Expensive. We enjoyed our evening regardless.,3
Great patio on several levels. Lots of dining options. Highly recommend.,4
My wife liked it and wants to come back. So yay! And the service was excellent.,4
Excellent food,4
"Good food, great service and nice ambience. I‚Äôm happy to return",4
"This is one of the most attractive patios in Toronto, and it is fairly quiet despite its location adjacent to busy commercial Yonge Street. For diners looking for a pub lunch, the food is a bit quirky but it is always tasty and attractively presented. Service is prompt and helpful. I look forward to my next visit!",4
The Miller was great! It was our anniversary and they brought us a glass of prosecco as soon as we sat down.,4
"They recently renovated and it's stunning.  It is pricey, but a great meal, with great service in a great atmosphere.",4
Not what it was pre pandemic,2
Bursts salad was great along with the oysters.  Mussels were also great!,3
"Birthday lunch for my wife.
2 little grandkids in tow.
Everything went very well.",4
One of the top spots in Toronto. I have been there about 10 times in the past couple of years.,4
"When you are charged $85 for an 8oz steak, but the presentation and quality that you get remind you of a cheap diner on the road... Nonetheless, the atmosphere, staff, and drinks are outstanding.",2
"Lovely evening on  beautiful patio
Great service from Christina 
Great tasting food",3
"Enjoyed our time, great service, only downside is that the prices have increased quite a bit",4
"Superb service . Carly is very attentive, professional, 
friendly and provides an outstanding service .  
Excellent fish and wine. 
We love coming to the Miller. Wahalid has always 
accommodated our special requests.",4
The Miller is my top choice for a business lunch at a central location. It has easy access by car with parking lot and adjacent to York Mills subway. The food and ambience are great. I highly recommend it.,4
Have dined there three times since recent renovations and while the atmosphere is lovely the service is worse than slow.,2
Very nice ambiance on the terrace. Food was great.,4
"Great ambience, great food and lovely service",4
"Great ambiance, although seated close to the road, so the traffic was a bit noisy which dampened otherwise great environment. The servers were courteous and efficient, the food was excellent. The prices now though increased by a lot but the quality of food is worth it. Thank you for a lovely evening.",4
"One of the nicest patios in toronto. Excellent service, great vibe. We enjoy it every time. Great for special occasions too.",4
Very cute patio. Cozy vibe. make sure to make a reservation. It usually gets busy on weekends.,4
Very over priced. Menu needs to be expanded with more selection and to offer different price points.,1
Great food and outstanding service.,4
"I have been to Miller's Tavern several times in the past and each time found it very pleasant. This time seems everything has changed. They are advertising ""Happy Hour from 3:00 pm to 5:00 pm but fail to disclose it does not  apply to all  levels of the garden. We were seated at the main level, upon receipt of the bill we were charged for each glass of wine separately. Asked to see the Manager who wouldn't barge and was quite rude. I informed him that there is no way I would leave any tip, which of course I did not. Also told him that I will do everything in my power to put this nasty practice into social media, news papers, etc....",0
"Food was great. We sat in the outdoor patio. Ambiance was lovely- the warm heaters, string lights and renovated deck. Customer service was excellent.",3
"The food was very disappointing, the mussels were extremely small and not tasty and the next table had to send back their $40 steak as it was over cooked.   This is a beautiful restaurant and they have increased thier prices several time - so is now more than over expensive.  This is fine if the food is of good quality but the last visit was very disappointing.",1
"Sadly the food is very expensive and is not very good. Trout was delicious but mussels were terrible. Lobster Mac really had no lobster. Baseball steak was overdone on outside and raw in middle. Frites were non existent. Just inferior French fries. Oysters were tiny. Very long wait for food too.  Very disappointing. Ambience on upper patio is good, and server tried. But overall many improvements needed.",2
"Gorgeous outdoor patio but that is all you are paying for. Ridiculously expensive for the quality and quantity of food. 
Prices just go up and quantity and quality keep going down. This will be my last visit to an old favorite",2
"My partner and I had a reservation to celebrate our 11 year anniversary and we were just blown away at the service we received. Our server Monica was just so amazing and attentive! Offered us glasses of bubbly on the house for our celebration which was so nice. Our appetizers, mains, and desserts were all delicious! The food came out quick and our orders always came together - so we didn‚Äôt have to wait on the other persons meal to arrive so we could eat together (this is a big deal to us lol) It was jazz night so we enjoyed some great music as well. 100% will be coming back. 10/10 for the service, food, and atmosphere!!",4
It rained so we got a table on the veranda and I really like the new d√©cor in there.  Thank goodness as it is very noisy inside.  I want to be clear that my stars for food relate to the variety available not the quality.  I used to love the Greek salad but it is off the menu now.  I cannot eat lettuce and so the other salads are a problem unless they can substitute arugula or spinach which they could not do.  I usually like to eat a light lunch and there are not many light things on the menu.  They also removed the lobster roll.  I decided to have the lobster club which was absolutely delicious but a heavier lunch than I would have preferred.  This is my bid to have the Greek salad (no lettuce) put back on the menu.,3
"The pricing is expensive, for the quality of food. 
We had to wait a long time for our food to come.
The server was exceptional as always",3
"Dinner for 4 people - love the new renovations - great atmosphere upstairs 
Really over priced however for what you get. Menu has changed dramatically and it‚Äôs far too expensive",3
Very Expensive for what you get taste and portion wise,3
Surroundings outside are beautiful. Way overpriced for what you are getting. No value at all!!!!!,1
"Menu needs revising with more tavern-style options. Food is definitely over-priced for what you get. The one favourable aspect is the patio. Wish management would focus on improving the menu, value, and service to match the ambience of the patio.",1
"Exceptional place to dine outside. Much like an oasis in the middle of the city, hidden from the traffic and noise of the street. Service was exceptional, encouraging and informative but not pushy. We were there for a birthday celebration - arrived at 6 pm and left at 1030. Would highly recommend it to others.  Some appetizers would small yet tasty. Entrees delicious. Dessert was shared. Terrific!",3
"I had the lobster sandwich and for $38 I expected a bit more than a few bites of lobster in.  Mostly is was bread, bacon, lettuce and tomatoes.  If I wanted a BLT, I would have ordered that and hopefully it would not have cost $38. 

The patio was beautiful and the service was great as well.",2
"The menu was limited and very expensive for what was served. A mediocre Cobb Salad crammed into a small bowl was $29, with a lemonade and tip, was $48. Service was unenthusiastic and not attentive. I would not return.",2
"Amazing food, respectful service, great location, lots of spots for parking!",4
"Although I have enjoyed  the convenience and ambience of The Miller many times over the past 20 years, as a more recently converted vegetarian of 3 years I am disappointed in the lack of main-course menu options to accommodate this popular diet. Salads and Sides do not comprise a complete meal as neither provide sufficient protein and leaves the vegetarian customer without an authentic restaurant experience. I am tired of having to compose my own dinner and, while the risotto IS suitable as a main course, I am not interested in ordering the same meal each time I visit The Miller.  My suggestion is simple: there is ALREADY a Tavern Burger on the menu that can EASILY be offered with either a meat patty or one of the MANY vegetarian alternatives on the market, to seamlessly address this concern.
Otherwise, I do love going to The Miller for its convenience, ambience and the tasty food it is known for.",3
"Rude staff(including the manager) , hard to get a decent table, salad had a bug in it, Romaine lettuce was old, soggy ,, poor quality mussels all dried up,, even the mojito tasted like water,,

Very unhappy!",0
Peter was super amazing.,4
Always enjoy a nice dinner at Miller Tavern. Recommend ;),4
Miller Tavern's beautiful patio is the perfect spot to meet a friend for a leisurely lunch.  Our menu choice was delicious and service excellent!,4
We had lunch for my friends birthday‚Ä¶amazing lunch‚Ä¶the moules frites were amazing‚Ä¶!!!,4
It was a pleasant evening with the live music that was on offer on Thursday night. That is what summer is about. Very relaxed and the food was so good! Will definitely be back!,4
Great ambience and location is also easy to get to.,4
In north Toronto this patio is terrific. No street traffic and a lovely patio.  Parking could be a problem.,4
Always a great place to dine!,4
Once again trying to get the table you need even with an early reservation becomes a difficult discussion. Host quite rude. You think I‚Äôd learn,2
We were a party of 5. I had the chicken pot pie and it really was not up to my expectations. Once the crust was off it was like chicken soup. The other meals were reported great. Service was iffy. One server very pushy.,2
"Great food
Good service 
I am coming back for sure",4
Excellent service with huge improvement in food. ‚ù§Ô∏è,4
"Our visit was amazing!  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left.  Our server was very good, she arrived at the table with perfect timing.  The menu was so appealing it made it difficult to decide what we wanted to order, we ended up ordering a few apps and a main to share, plenty of food, and very delicious.  I love the ambiance on the outdoor patio, sheltered from the street amongst some very lush greenery.  Will be back!",3
beautiful patio... very welcoming... a little too expensive but on a hot summer day it was a perfect venue.,3
Lovely patio!,4
"Overall nice experience,kind of ackward they didn't have paper napkins and cheesecake,something like lower quality restaurants got all the time...",4
"lovely place, has the look and feel of a place that has been around for a while, probably an amazing neighborhood gem at one point. Service was spotty, specials sounded great, unfortunately we only overheard them from another server, beautiful looking buns were brought out to our table and then immediately removed when the food runner realized he dropped them at the wrong table, guess we should‚Äôve tucked into them quicker‚Ä¶he then proceeded to drop them at the table down from us, don‚Äôt think I would be impressed if I knew my food had been sitting at another table for a minute first‚Ä¶ Nice looking menu, a bit of emphasis on prime cuts of steak but unfortunately the execution wasn‚Äôt there, and it was very poorly cooked. Table check was immediate as soon as the food went down, whatever happened to the two minute, two bite rule? Took about five minutes to flag down the waiter to let them know I had an issue, by then my girlfriend had nibbled away at her risotto (which she said was very nice) At that point I either give the kitchen another chance and eat by myself or write off the romantic dinner, chose the latter. Was comped two glasses of wine for the trouble but would have preferred what the menu promised, especially at the prices advertised

i‚Äôm sure other people have had much better experiences and the place does have a serious restaurant ambience, probably just not my lucky night",1
"Nice restaurant and good vibes. However,  food quality is really low. We ordered muscles which is not fresh, baked potato is hard , lamb shank is cold. French pastry chef made dessert tastes just ok.",2
Incredible service!,4
"It never disappoints, especially in the summer. The food is always first-class, and the service is excellent. I am a regular.",4
We were a party of four for dinner and waited an extremely long time for our entree.  The manager himself came out to apologize for the delay.,2
Great spot.  Lovely interior and patios.  Will be going there again.,3
It's not like it used to be. Service still great but prices are crazy.,1
"Everything from the ambiance, service, drinks and food were superb.",4
Nice updated upstairs room.,3
"I haven't been there in awhile, really enjoyed the food, service was excellent.",4
Great food and great wait staff as always. This is one of our favourites to lunch at.,4
Great restaurant atmosphere and food is amazing. It‚Äôs a bit pricey but the food quality is exceptional.,4
"Great service, quality food, not fancy decorated dishes but tasty and fresh. great environment",4
love the place. The ambiance is so chill and the food is amazing!!,4
"This has been a regular neighbourhood meetup place for my friends, but no more.  This last time, the service was very poor - we met for drinks and apps, but after seating us they asked us to move because we were not ordering dinner.  I had reserved online and there was no indication that the patio required ordering dinner. Also most other tables were empty at the time. Our waitress was surly and unfriendly. She wouldn't ask the bartender to make me a non-alcoholic cocktail.  We met there at 5:30, but we couldn't order from the happy hour menu because they said happy hour now ends at 5pm!  Isn't 5pm happy hour??  Prices have also increased, which I understand because of inflation, but a ridiculous amount.  Charging $7 for dinner rolls??  Overall, not a good experience.",1
"Great service, helpful and personable wait staff, delicious food that was nicely paced. Good wine list and wines by the glass.",4
"Nice experience . We‚Äôll be back, 
Thank you great server",4
"Ordered burgers and drinks - were there for 2.5 hours on a Wednesday. They also cooked our WELL DONE burgers rare. Our drinks came 30 mins after ordering. 

1/5. Disappointed.",0
Always as you expect. That‚Äôs a good thing. Reliable and good food.,4
the service was excellent and the server made the evening very enjoyable,3
Great food and excellent service !,4
Road traffic noise,2
Service was slow. Food was good but way over priced.,2
The Miller Tavern has always been one of our favourite restaurants especially the patio in the summer. The renovated Verandah looks lovely and can‚Äôt wait to try it. James our waiter was excellent attending to our every need in a timely fashion. We arrived before our scheduled reservation but were accommodated right away which pleased us. The food was incredible and the ambiance of the patio is lovely.,4
In my reservation I mentioned a birthday for my husband. They were outstanding regarding his birthday. My expectations were exceeded. Beautiful outside earring shady and gorgeous table. Thank you serving staff you made it special.,4
Dodd ok but very over-priced for what it is. Server was pathetic,2
"Lovely patio, great service, delicious food.  So nice to this so close by.",4
"Overall, just not the experience I was expecting from this establishment. I was prepared for the higher prices, but still expected to receive proper value for the pricing. Not sure what justifies the $80 price of an 8oz steak with 1 side? Certainly much better service and overall hospitality of the serving staff should be a given. My fault for not sending the overdone steak back, but I'm not apt to do that and must say that I did find it most flavorful regardless. I won't be back soon.",2
"Fantastic patio. Great service. Very average food, small portions,and downtown pricing. Could be so much better. Great place for drinks.",2
We were seated inside on the bottom level - it was extremely cold and dark and for the most part empty. We had a brand new waiter who was mostly unsupervised. Not worth the money. Very disappointing. We will not be back,1
"Excellent service and atmosphere.
Risotto delicious",4
"Service was terrible, got the order wrong n took a very long time to get whatever was ordered. There were  lots of staff . So Vo reason for slowww service. 
We were greeted by the hostess and right after hello we were told that our table must be vacated by 8:15
Won‚Äôt be going back.
Found it expensive for what it was",1
The prices on all the menu items are very high,2
"Lovely patio but the food wasn‚Äôt up to pare. The quality of meat in my sandwich could have been better and the dipping sauce was a dark sludge. Given the prices, I expected better.",2
Service was attentive. Food was average. I ordered a white wine sangria (with seasonal fruits) that was served in an ordinary water glass with a slice of canned peach and orange juice. The trout and fries were great though.,2
Wonderful food. Service was a bit slow but friendly. Music was way too loud.,3
"Solid food quality, well prepared. Our server Alexander was top notch. He made recommendations and offered suggestions.
Given how impacted the restaurant Industry has been it was a pleasant surprise to enjoy great service.",3
Great food and service!,4
"Beautiful outdoor patio, lush trees and flowers, feels like you are dining in the country and not in the city.",3
Although the food was decent - it was $90 for 2 small salads and 2 coffees!! For lunch?? Way too dark inside for a beautiful summer afternoon:(,4
Great! As expected,4
Very very expensive.  Prices have increased even from the very expensive prices last year.,2
"Excellent food and service. 
Prices are very high.",4
"Service was great. Patio is absolutely beautiful. 
We used to visit here all the time but $30 for a burger and fries‚Ä¶ and the fries were burnt ends from the fryer was very disappointing. I told our the girl who cleared our dishes and she agreed.",3
We used to enjoy happy hour on the summer. It now you cannot sit on the patio and the happy hour menu for food id literally 2 or 3 things that are not at all good,1
"We frequent the Miller often and have always found great value and exceptional quality! We I‚Äôll certainly return!
Merci beaucoup",4
As usual we had a wonderful time at Millers Tavern with outstanding food and service.,4
"Good food and service. Excellent server. 
Lots of visible dust on booth dividers, speaker,etc. Details not clean for such an establishment.",3
"Very pleasant out door dining, excellent food and service. Price on high end.",4
"Wine selection and ambience are great, the food is not worth it.",1
"We love the patio at Millers. An informal and warm area. The server was outstanding, very helpful with a big and friendly smile. He actually contributed a lot to the enjoyment of our evening.",3
Outstanding service and delicious food! I highly recommend trying Miller Tavern for a nice evening out.,4
"Good service, good food, nice place outdoor, nice environment",4
Great spot for business lunch,4
Excellent food.  The most beautiful outdoor patio in Toronto,4
Very unhappy with the service and they made us move to a horrible table,0
Fantastic dining experience. The patio is beautiful with pretty lights. I had the lobster Mac and cheese and it was delicious. Very filling! I couldn't finish it. My friend had the burger and fries and she loved that too. I'll be going back!,4
Always great food; outdoor patio is spacious and comfortable.,4
Best patio in the city. Ample parking and great menu options.,4
Beautiful patio in the city. Food is excellent. Servers are busy and friendly. Prices are high but you get what you pay for. When I called to make the reservation I mentioned we had one guest in our party who uses a walker. The person on the phone was very attentive and provided an easily accessible table for us in the shade exactly as requested. The Miller patio is always a treat.,4
"Lovely atmosphere and lots of umbrellas to keep you cool. 
Excellent service. Our lunch was yummy, fish and chips.",3
Fantastic night.  Celebrating birthdays.,4
I have been to this location many times and each time had a great experience.,4
"The service was horrible,the food was not good at all specially for the price .will never go again and the washrooms very dirty",0
Monica is a attentive and competent server! She made our birthday celebration memorable!,4
Good service and food . Like the patio,3
"food was delicious - a very good menu! Our server was Maria and she was  outstanding. Highly recommended, good parking and do bring some money.",4
A memorable culinary experience.,4
"Service was great, very enjoyable evening",4
Very nice place.  Good service and friendly personal.,4
Service was excellent and patio is always lovely.,3
"The patio at the Tavern is stunning and was the perfect venue for our group of 6. Service was perfect (thanks James for taking such great care of us ladies) and all of our food delicious (nice presentation as well!).
Highly recommend!",4
The stars say it all.,4
Lovely patio. Very expensive and mains come with no sides.  Limited menu.,3
"We had a wonderful time at the Miller, catching up with old friends. Our waiter was so fun, friendly and patient with us as we chose our table, our drinks and food. Having not been out in a while, it was a really great re-entry into dining out again!  Portions were very generous and very fresh!",3
"My friends and I went for lunch. It was a perfect day!  We really enjoyed the outdoor setting, the food was good and our server was very very nice. 
Plus, the Rogers network was down, so no-one was glued to their cell phones LOL!

Two notes for improvement: 
The water was very lukewarm.  A few ice cubes would have been perfect. 

One of my friends is GF.  You do not offer GF bread.  I thought you would.",3
It's a lovely place for lunch with friends.  We never felt rushed and the food was delicious!,3
"Fabulous atmosphere and service on the patio. 
I am pescatarian and I find that the fish dishes are either swimming in oil or butter. I will likely just order veggie sides as a meal next time.",3
Loved the new menu and renovated spaces. Service was excellent,4
"Honestly, I find myself saying the same thing every time I leave. For the price, the food was very average. Not everyone in the party would agree,, but the price you charge for the salads, they should be way more attractive looking and tasty. The burger was very well liked but for that price, it should be.",2
"The service was excellent, as was the ambience outside on the deck on a beautiful summer day. In general, the food was very tasty; however, there was very little lobster in the brioche lobster roll, and that was disappointing. I would go back to choosing the Miller Burger over the Lobster Roll next time.",3
the menu has been downgraded in the last year or two. the selection is not was it used to be.,4
"The menu was way overpriced. I know the pandemic has left all restaurants scrambling to catch up and recover, but the bill wasn't easy to swallow. I would expect $100 steaks at BlueBlood, not at The Miller. Our bill with tip was $127 for two beers, a hamburger, a salad and a (generous) scoop of gelato. You have a very nice establishment, but I worry you won't hold onto your clientele. For sure, I won''t be rushing back.",2
Our waiter noticed our French accent and served us accordingly!,4
Music playing over loudspeaker was incredibly loud,3
Beautiful patio. Not crowded at all. Food was delicious. Excellent service.,4
Best outdoor spot in Toronto!,4
My biggest complaint would be the price.  Three jumbo shrimp cocktail for $44 is highway robbery.  Food was tasty and waiter was very nice but not quite attentive enough.  I won‚Äôt go back sadly.,2
Miller Tavern is a beautiful venue outside.  It felt wonderful after being so restricted for so long.  Our service was outstanding but the food reminded me of the 50's.  The prices were too high considering the ordinary items on the menu.,2
Nice outdoor patio. Service was good. Food was ok-not great and overinflated prices.,2
"A bit of a wait for mail meal, but the food was excellent.  Staff was very helpful and assisted with wheelchair access and table accomodation.",4
We enjoyed my bday night there . Very nice ambiance ..good food and music,4
"Our wait staff person was excellent.  Food was hot and delicious.
I would recommend restaurant, however, not for everyone, as it is quite pricey.
Thank you for making our birthday special.
Irene & granddaughter",4
"The menu has changed and become ridiculously expensive for what you get. Patio is great, but inside being renovated and they no longer serve Happy Hour on the patio. Honestly, the prices where befitting a much higher quality establishment. $29 for a cobb salad, $9/shrimp if you want to add shrimp, $39 for a burger $14 for a side of fries. The server was lovely, but even she couldn‚Äôt make up for the shock of the value.",1
"The menu has been updated more towards the high end, but still delicious. Service is impeccable as always.",3
"I always enjoy the restaurant however it was very, very noisy and difficult to carry on a conversation. Also noted there are no places for disabled parking close to the entrance.",3
I like Miller Tavern because of the beautiful patio and food . Service is great too !,3
Great experience food was top notch service fantastic! Very enjoyable will definitely come back!,4
"Great, amazing food. Wonderful jazz music from speakers...not blaring.  Wait staff attentive but not overly so. Patio is so beautiful.  Perfect for special occasions.",4
"I always love coming here, and was not disappointed coming for my partner‚Äôs birthday either. If you want a more casual but fancier night out, this is a great choice.",4
"The Miller‚Äôs location is in a very accessible location with good parking options and close to the 401 and the subway. It‚Äôs easy to meet friends there. It‚Äôs always been pricey, but it‚Äôs ok for an occasional evening out.",2
"I love everything about The Miller.  Good food, and service. I do find it pretty noisy on the lower level.",3
Food were decent but the services was extremely slow and poor. We waited for more than 10 mins to get the server placing our order. The server didn't realise several times our empty glasses.,2
The music from the speakers was way too loud! Turn it down so your guests can talk to each other!,3
Thank you for a great evening! The bartender and his team on the outdoor patio were fabulous!!!,4
Stumbled upon a hidden gem.  Food and service was amazing. We loved the oysters and lobster mac n cheese.,4
"We met friends for lunch, we had not seen one another in person for a year and a half. It couldn‚Äôt have been better. Our waiter Eric was wonderful, he was attentive but not on top of us. All in all it was a great time. We will do it again very soon. Your patio is one of the best we have been to.",4
"Music too loud, we were right underneath a speaker.  Kitchen was very very slow but food was great and service pleasant",3
Wonderful afternoon on the one of the most beautiful patios in #thesix. BUT disappointed that happy hour is NOT extended to the patio.,3
"Shortly after we ordered more wine, our waiter came to us and said ""I've been told that you were made aware that we need your table at 8 p.m.""  At this point it was 7:45 and at no time had been  been made aware that we would have to leave by 8 p.m.  We drank our wine quickly so that we would be ready to leave to accommodate the restaurant  only to be told that it was an error.   We then ordered coffee which we received a bill for.   Better service would have been to comp our 3 decaf coffees.  Other than that, sitting on patio together was great.",2
"Excellent food and service.,
James our server was very attentive!",4
"The Miller has always been our favourite restaurant.  The atmosphere is relaxing, and the food is delicious, but the most wonderful thing about the Miller is their staff.  They are warm, friendly, and very efficient.  They always make us feel very welcome and very special.",4
We chose to eat indoors as the outdoor humidity was untenable and there were also threats of thunderstorms.  The indoor atmosphere was quite dark but otherwise the atmosphere was pleasant and enjoyable and the service was very good.,3
Food is excellent. Service is attentive but not obtrusive.  Always enjoy it here.,4
"Great patio. Super Portobello Mushroom Burger. Fries a bit disappointing. Service was excellent. A nice hum, not too noisy.",3
"Menu with prices should be the same both at the restaurant and on line. Steaks were $10+ more expensive on restaurants menu. Found the restaurant very noisy, not a place for a romantic dinner.  Food was okay.",3
Great to be back. All around good to excellent altho seats are cramped,3
"All I would say, is that we came for happy hour.  And, we have been to the Miller Tavern many times.  I reserved an outside table.  There were many tables free but because we were having happy hour drinks we were not able to have them outside, even though there were so many tables available.",3
Food was great but the salads could be a bit bigger.   The service was outstanding!,3
Although we reminisced over the days of the old days of Miller tavern as Miller tavern has matured we have too. Love the patio and the upgrades. Happy to have staple in the community.,4
"My husband Caesar salad came with our main course.  The server did not ask if he wanted the salad before his main course.  My trout was swimming in butter.  I knew it was in butter but not swimming in butter.  We sat for quite a while with our dirty dishes on our table,  Our server was very nice but had too many tables.",2
Why nothing for vegetarians???,3
"Beautiful, large patio, great food and good service",4
"One of the best patios in the city.  Just be aware that the patio closes at 11, with last call at 1015.  For a Saturday night, that seemed very early & odd.",4
As always the Miller tavern never disappoints. Even with their new menu everything tasted amazing!,4
"Fathers Day with 3 generations. 
Lobster  max and cheese decadent
Steak fabulous
Decent seafood platter though lobster tasteless
Branzino tasty but very small portion for the price and zero accompaniments. Totally not worth the price. 
Overall good experience but really expensive!!!!",3
If you think that that you will be able to enjoy Happy Hour on the gorgeous patio guess again. I was told After I arrived with friends on Saturday June 18th that Happy Hour was not served on the patio and we had to be inside .  What? I have had outdoor Happy Hour many times in the past and nothing on website said that it was served inside only.  Brutal!,2
"I chose to celebrate my birthday with Miller Tavern as a last minute booking and I was so pleased with everything. The ambience was exactly what I was looking for in terms of a patio celebration. The food and drinks were outstanding, and the service was fast and friendly. I will be returning soon!",4
"Good food, good choices. Best patio. Service great.",3
Many items on the beer and food menu were not available...,2
"Lousy feeling on account of the ruckus by several staff and managers over the Happy Hour and appetizers.
We were headed for a relaxing get together ,  first one since  Covid ..they insisted we could only do HH..inside ‚Ä¶not on the patio.
Spoiled the whole afternoon.
Nothing mentioned about patio being out of bounds for HH.
‚ÄúCustomer is always right‚Äù‚Ä¶not on your life!. We were the only people except 2 ‚Ä¶inside.
What a disappointment.
Won‚Äôt be back ‚Ä¶ever
Management could do with some ‚Äúbe pleasant to the customer‚Äù
Bad taste left.

"Very nice menu options.  Loved the lounge area outside.  Very comfortable seating and ambiance is fantastic.  Food quality was excellent.  I had the fish and chips, however, was trying to decide between several other choices.  Will come back again!",4
"The Best Burger I ever had, little bit expensive but it's worth it you pay also fries the best I ever had quality that's for sure, deserts way over priced and I didn't really like them except the mango ,strawberry ice cream",3
Food was overpriced and not presented well.,1
"Our server Hannah was outstanding. Very attentive. So sweet and fun. 
Food was excellent 
We had a fantastic lunch. 
Thank you!",4
"Excellent food, we had the chicken pot pie & burgers. The house salad with the pie was excellent! 
James our waiter was lovely & efficient",4
"The food can be improved. Fois gras was extremely greasy. Oyster was small and skinny, a sign that it has been there for a while. The shucker should not serve the skinny ones at all. The waitress gave another complimentary half dozen after she heard my comment but it came skinny still. But I didn‚Äôt say anything as she had tried so hard to make it up and it was not her fault. The escargot was tasteless to think it should taste strong of butter and garlic but no. 
Overall food tastes need more attention. 
The patio was very nice, very comfortable. We had enjoyed that. The rest of the restaurant was blocked off looking sad. The balcony was my favourite but not sure if it is opened.
Hope food can improve and we can go again.",3
Very good food and services.  Unexpected birthday dessert.  Look forward to the new renovation of upstairs.,3
"We all enjoyed our exciting in the Miller. 
Amazing food and service!",4
Good place to meet friends for a  satisfactory lunch. Accessible from all directions of the city.,3
Your manager can call me .,2
The food was fantastic and the ambiance perfect for my husband‚Äôs birthday. Will be back for more special occasions. Sat inside but took a peek at the patio - just beautiful.,4
"Service was attentive, food was delicious and drinks arrived promptly, great ambiance, its was our anniversary and my wife and I fully enjoyed the experience and will return in future.",4
Anna was so lovely and we had such a fantastic dinner! Highly recommend this place to everyone.,4
"Lovely meal, service a little slow but pleasant",3
Great food and outstanding service by Megan.,4
"Food was very good.  Service excellent, not so much because of the person who took our order, but because various people brought the food to our table in a courteous and prompt manner.  Manager seemed approachable and very professional.
Location is a bit questionable, because it is beside two parking lots and a major roadway. However, the leafy surroundings, music and general atmosphere was very nice and helped to obscure the fact I was surrounded by cement.
Menu was not kid-friendly.",3
"The patio renovations have made a huge difference. It looks pretty & is comfortable. 
Menu has improved & with that come price increases so it is not really a local place anymore. Great to have oysters back & steak was good. Mice cocktails & wine list
Very enjoyable but now more special occasion although it is always busy",3
Enjoyable evening. Had to ask for menus and cutlery.  Wondering if our waiter was new?  Appreciated the glasses of bubbly at the end of the evening to celebrate the anniversary.,2
Still one of my favourites but not going as much due to the escalating prices. Very expensive,3
"We opted to eat inside, we were the only patrens indoors. It was a lovely day so many people went out to the patio. Been deaf and using hearing aids, the ambient noise is important to me. The music inside was very versatile but a little loud, and distracting, ( for me). That is why we chose inside. Our server Pete(er) was brilliant, lovely, friendly, upbeat and really attentive. An absolute gem.
Food outstanding. As always.",4
It was great. Good hospitality and polite and clever stuff,4
"The menu was versatile and Anna, our server, was very helpful in explaining details about the dishes available. Excellent service!",4
The Lobster Club is a must have and comes with great fries.,4
"Seats of th√© banquette were very soft so all five of us were quite low to the table. Ridges in between seats created height but not comfortable to sit on. 
Recognizing the birthdays being celebrated with a dessert, including a candle was a nice touch.",2
Wished we were seated on the beautiful patio but inside was very nice too,3
"Good food, good service, easy access, good place to meet friends for lunch.",3
"Ordered fish and chips for 2 people 32$ each plus tax and tip, added up to 90 $ for a small amount of cod fish, with lots of greasy breading. The chips were nice. Coleslaw was first not served, asked for it and server first said it's not included, but after ordering came back and brought 2 portions of brownish colored, almost blant Coleslaw. Not impressed. It was fairly loud, but okay for a conversation.",1
"Good food, great service, good parking, and a birthday desert surprise made this a delightful experience.",4
"Given a major storm blew through, the staff were attentive and service was prompt and friendly",3
I love the Miller. The food is delicious. The service is excellent but prices are expensive.,4
"Excellent food and service. 
Great patio.",4
"The food was awesome, had the lamb shank and it didn‚Äôt disappoint!
Pete the server was polite and attentive, looking forward to being on the patio soon!",4
"We visited Miller Tavern York Mills for the first time. A nice ambiance overall, sports on the Tv can be easily ignored. Nice white tablecloths and wine glasses on the table with soft lighting. We're disappointed to write this as we were hoping to make it a regular dining spot in North York. 

The service was excellent, and we were very happy, but unfortunately, the food was completely unseasoned. No salt, pepper, or anything else on or in the food - we joked 'oh, that's why the big salt & pepper shakers are on the table'. Everything was cooked perfectly, but bland and without flavour of any kind, such as in the beurre blanc, potatoes, fish, chicken, crab, or other items we tried. 

Definitely visit for $19 drinks, and top-notch service, skip the food.",2
Under construction.....and a new (post covid?) menu.  I miss some of the old items and not convinced the downstairs should have the white linen table look (vs. the old wood bar vibe).  Feels like you are trying too hard!,1
Great spot!,4
"Our server was outstanding in all areas.
I had the lamb loin which was lovely except for a very large portion of unevenly cooked & bland kale. 
My dinner guest ordered the sole and enjoyed every bite. 
It was perfect weather for the recently updated patio.",3
"From the time we arrived Sercuce was amazing, food was outstanding.  Sat outside on the patio with an absolutely gorgeous day! Loved it!",4
Food and service was fantastic as usual. Looking forward to the indoor facelift.,4
"The Miller remains The Miller with the high volume of noise which suits the younger crowd, but not the seniors and there are many there‚Ä¶Our waitress Maria was good and fun. Of course sold us the bottle of wine and I am sure with directions from Management to do so? Food delicious but wonder about smaller portions, thus kinder prices? David and I could not get our mouths around the volume of the sandwiches which resulted in a lot of fallout and quite the mess on clothes and table. Wonder about half sandwiches with a soup? So little amount of lobster in my Lobster Club thus highly overcharged. All 4 of us commented that the volume of the orders reminded us all of the heaped orders that are prevalent in the USA with horrible waste. Hoping that the Second Harvest is hooked up with the Miller kitchen in gathering all leftovers for the poor and hungry.",3
"The management staff (GM) couldn't possibly any more arrogant.  When I questioned the price for 3 shrimp for $39.00, they told me that this is market price, and I shouldn't have ordered it, if I thought the price was out of line.  No apology, just a ""we charge what we pay"", which, if that were the case, would put them out of business.  Also, after paying the ridiculous overpriced bill, the restaurant cancelled my Open Table reservation so I couldn't collect the points from the rez, forcing me to call OT and fix the issue.  In summary, this is a 3.5 star restaurant, at best, that thinks they are a 5 star, and can charge whatever prices they want.  The food is mediocre and priced at the same level as Morton's, Harbor 60 and STK, which are real 5 star steakhouses.",0
"The service at the Miller, as always was fabulous.  The food was also great.  However, it would have been nice to spend Mother's Day afternoon outside on the terrace on such a beautiful day, especially on a terrace a great as the one at The Miller.",3
"As regular visitors to the Miller Tavern for many years we were very excited to celebrate Mother‚Äôs Day 2022.

It is important to state firstly that the staff were, and always are, excellent. 5*‚Äôs to them.

The food however, was dreadful.

Mother‚Äôs Day Brunch: $55 a head for 3 courses, plus we added a $50 bottle of Prosecco.

To start:
2 x crab croquettes
2 x steak tartare

The tartare was excellent. Good portion with a huge amount of delicious bread.
5/5

The crab croquettes were terrible. 3 tiny fried ovals with a tiny amount of aioli squeezed on them, rolling around on a tea plate. Fryer burnt and greasy on the outside and cold in the middle, zero flavour or seasoning. We would have sent them back but they were literally a single mouthful each. Happily there was more than enough beef tartar and bread to go around.
0/5

Mains:
Breakfast Benny x 1
Wagu Burger x 3

The Benny was OK, but the unpalatable, un-toasted, cold, soggy crumpets it was served on spoiled it.
3/5

The Wagu burger, which we have previously enjoyed many times at MT, was so disappointing. It had been changed up from usual to a brunch version - it was gross.

Served with over-cooked fried egg, cheese and bacon, (knowing Wagu beef is both high in fat and very tasty), it was impossible to enjoy the beef with the frying oil that was pooling on the plates - the bacon was soggy and wet. We had them boxed to take home for the dog.
0/5

Desserts:
4 x brownie.
Took them home, and the kids tried them. Not very brownie like - heavy and solid. They said the flavour was decent.
2/5

Our total bill came to $392 (including tax, tip, 4 orange juices and a $50 bottle of Prosecco).

Much as we love the Miller Tavern, we will not be eating there again in a hurry. The patio is beautiful and a wonderful spot to stay for a drink, (the patio wasn‚Äôt open).

We have dined here many times over the years, have recommended it regularly. No longer. Hope this was a blip, but it will take a lot for us to eat meal here again.",0
Attentive and friendly staff and delicious food. A little pricey given the location and dated ambiance of the lower level. Looking forward to seeing the renovations.,3
"Always a good go to place.  Family loves it.  Prices are crazy, but the quality is always there.  Service is always amazing.",3
"Exceptional service, great venue, delicious food!  We will definitely be back!",4
The food at the Miller is better than ever.  Great new menu!,4
"Great food but servers not wearing masks.
Old uncomfortable booths and too noisy for  relaxing conversation.",2
"You need to scratch things off your wine and food menus that aren't available.  Not our server's fault but two or three different wines we tried to order and he recommended weren't available when he went to punch them into the system.  Also, one of the main entrees weren't available either.  Management should let their staff know so they have to tell their customers...oh sorry, we don't have that one either.",3
"Good food, but grilled shrimp were $6.00 each and overcooked.  Oysters were superb.  Salad was good.  Espresso coffee was excellent .
Service was excellent, our server Maria was attentive and friendly and very professional.
Restaurant was under renovation but not intrusive, but diner noise level was high.
Overall experience was very enjoyable and would definitely return.",3
Easy access to this location and one of the best burgers I have ever enjoyed.,3
"Spur of the moment decision to go. 

The food was amazing. Plated beautifully. 

We had the lamb shank and the halibut as mains. Oysters and salad for appetizers. Would definitely order everything again.",4
"I would say the experience overall was OK.  Certainly not poor but also not excellent.
Our server was pleasant and professional .
The Squash galette was OK but not particularly flavourful. Meh.
Waldorf salad OK but not much actual fruit in there which is the essence of Waldorf Salad.
Ordered focaccia bread to drink with our wine while waiting for our dinner but it arrived with our food. When it did arrive it was very good.
Noise level very loud due to some large groups. Why the music is blaring loud so that people have to shout over it to be heard is beyond me.",3
Great wagu burger and lamb,4
"Been a customer for decades. Always great food, service and atmosphere. Whether lower , upper , or outside, you cant go wrong.",4
"Always a lovely meal at Miller Tavern. Looking forward to upstairs opening up and the patio too. Not a big fan of downstairs but understandable during renos.    
Love going here with friends as we used to come here ""back in the day"" when it was the Jolly Miller - great sentimental value to the place for us too.  :)",3
"The upper level was closed due to construction which we were not notified of in advance. There was loud drilling and construction noise as well as construction related chemical smells. 
Our server was excellent, friendly prompt and polite. 
Our meals were good however the menu is very limited if you‚Äôre seeking healthier (especially gluten free) options.",2
"Server was 10/10 
Too noisy and the food was just okay",3
Miller service and food still maintaining expectations but very expensive.,3
"At the time of the booking, I checked the menu they had on open table.  It had many choices; I was specifically interested in one item as it is my wife‚Äôs favourite.  When got there, I was so disappointed to see that they only had very few selections and I was told the menus changed long ago!  I was almost ready to leave but then we decided to find something and have it.  As it seems open table or / and this restaurant is not up to date on their menus, please call the restaurant to make sure they have what you are looking for.",1
Our waiter was outstanding!!,4
"We are repeat customers of this restaurant.  But our last visit on 12/4 was disappointing.  There was a significant drop in both food quality and service.  My wife ordered a Caesar salad to start and it was great as usual.  I ordered French onion soup but it was so salty that it was not edible.  I sent it back and had crab cake instead.  That was so-so.  We shared a lobster club as the second course.  It took forever to come.  When it arrived, the bread on the bottle was really soggy.  Probably due to two factors.  First, the lettuce and tomato were really wet.  Second, it had probably been sitting around for a long time before our server picked it up so the water from the aforementioned wet veggie dripped to the bread on the bottom.  We will give this establishment another chance snd hope that it will be better.",1
Great as always.,4
Overall a good experience. I would definitely recommend the place for casual/business occasions.,3
The service was terrific. The food was average and over-salted. Disappointing overall. the prices are sky-high and not worth it.,2
Had a fun time at happy hour. Food is always great. Looking forward to the patio reopening and the renod Veranda,3
"Staff/service was wonderful, food was great. Very enjoyable evening.",4
Tavern/bar food. Only one steak in menu. A little pricey.,3
"We all had hamburgers which were delicious with very tasty fries. 
Our server was very friendly and efficient",4
Beautiful experience. Great authentic live music. We enjoyed start to finish. Good wine list. Good menu.,4
The food was over priced for the value.  I don‚Äôt mind paying the price if the food is worth it,1
We go to the Miller Tavern a lot.  I love the atmosphere on the lower level.  It's so cozy.  The service was excellent.  I was very disappointed in the food this time though.  The trout almondine was just swimming in fat and I had ordered that lunch as a healthy choice.  The skin was crunchy and delicious - well done on that!  My guest had a very soggy (bread) Reuben.  The coffee and dessert were excellent.  I'll be back but the chef should know about food issues.,3
Family visiting from out of town. Getting together and sharing good food with loved ones.,3
Prices are exorbitant for the food received. the food is certainly fine enough but does not merit in quantity or quality the prices charged.,1
"The food was delicious and was brought promptly. The wait staff were extremely busy, so we had to ask for service several times. The noise level was very high and made it very difficult to talk or listen. Would much prefer to return when we could sit on the patio where conversation is easier.",3
"Disappointed as food and service were not as good as I have previously experienced. First time dining on the lower level, so that may have been a factor. Fries with beef rib dip were greasy. Squash salad with chicken was good. Caramel sauce on sticky toffee pudding was burnt and, therefore, bitter tasting. Pudding and vanilla sauce were both bland. 

Service haphazard and waiter, although polite, looked harassed and nervous. Sat by window so lighting was fine but noticed other diners using flashlight on cell phone to read menu.",2
Nice atmosphere. But overpriced. $6.00 per shrimp is too much.,4
Great all around - food pricey.,4
I ordered the French Onion soup and the Chicken Pot Pie.  Both were so salty that I ate half of the soup and maybe 1/4 of the pie.  Neither the server or the person who picked up my plate did anything about it even though I told them it was too salty for me to eat.  The overall bill was over $350 for my table for a meal I couldn't eat.  Will not be returning.  Extremely disappointed.,0
We haven‚Äôt been out for dinner in such a long time and our experience at Miller Tabern was perfect. Our waiter was so attentive yet gave us the right amount of space to enjoy ourselves. The food was amazing!! We will definitely be going back.,4
It was great! But so noisy during lunch hour!,4
Good was expensive and not tasty. Bad value,0
Food ok but pricey,2
Absolutely delicious. A bit pricey but well worth it. The service was amazing. She was nearby without being intrusive and took care of all our needs even before we realized we had needs!,4
"Excellent food, nice ambience, quick service. Pricey but worth it.",4
"Wow have their prices gone up, by a lot",2
Miller is my go to. Always a good experience. Can‚Äôt wait for patio season. As I think everywhere prices are getting up there. As a senior this will probably reduce my visit intervals but still highly recommended,4
"Just good to be back in a restaurant that was busy and enjoyable, thanks to the Miller",3
"The live music was great, but definitely too loud - impossible to continue conversation. Prices have gone up significantly - not fully justified with the complication of the dishes. Too bad only full pints are served - considering the drivers, half pints should also be available!",3
"Burrata salad made me choke because there was so much vinegar on it. Does the chef know the standard ratio of oil to vinegar? Ordered focaccia rolls to absorb the acid and was served sourdough rolls.
Ordered the halibut ( which I had eaten before). This time it was over-salted and drowned in a mash of over-salted, overcooked vegetables. I picked out the fish and left the rest. It was inedible.",2
"Server was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. I did not find that the food was exceptional for the price paid. The ambiance was nice, but definitely not worth the money.",3
"We had a great time on March 13. We were celebrating 3 birthdays and they made all our guests feel special. They even gave the birthday boy and girls a dessert on the house.  Anna our server was quite lovely and very attentive. 
We will be coming back sometime soon to celebrate more special occasions.",4
"Server (Anna) was great. Present but not obtrusive. Food was 9.5/10, as always. We go regularly because we can count on them.",4
"Waitress was too pushy. It was noisy, food was so so.",1
"Excellent food, service and wine menu. Live music was too loud - couldn‚Äôt have a conversation.",4
"Nice atmosphere, decent food, good service, moderate prices.",2
Our server was great - friendly and attentive.  The food was excellent - a great night out,4
Lovely spot for lunch or dinner.  Food and service were great.,4
Lovely evening. Excellent Service!,4
Reservation requests were followed. Service was prompt and lovely. Food was delicious. Easy place to visit and watch the game too.,4
"Service was pretty good and food was ok, but definitely so over price for the ambient, food design, food quality and portion! For the price, I would definitely spending my time at a place with better atmosphere and food next time!",1
The food was good and the place has ample parking.,3
"Extremely noisy, where we were seated, howling baby right beside us as well as a screaming kid a few tables over something which is largely out of your control, the band‚Ä¶.. I thought they were on top of us but our server was very good. I suppose your construction doesn‚Äôt help it is what it is.",2
Good food and service !,4
Great atmosphere but pricey for lunch.  Two pints and fish&chips with tip was $77.29.,2
"Once again everything was perfect. Delicious food, great service, convenient parking, classic charm...it makes every visit an experience to cherish.",4
"The Miller Tavern has very good food, great service and a grown up ambiance with prices to match.  We went as a party of six to celebrate my father's birthday.  We ate on the lower level as they are renovating the upper dining room.  The lighting is pretty low and they had fireplace TV playing as well as TVs over the bar with the hockey game on.  The service was very good and friendly and they made my father feel very special.  The food was very good and started with a charcuterie board and then a couple of Lobster Mac and Cheeses, Lamb Shank, an 18 oz ribeye steak and Mushroom Risotto as mains.  Everyone liked their meals although the Risotto was a bit salty.  Dessert was excellent.  As mentioned this place is not inexpensive but I would recommend as a place to celebrate a milestone or for a romantic night out.",3
"I go about once a month, and it's always a wonderful experience. I leave looking forward to coming back.",4
"Great place for business lunch. Quiet, spacious, good food",4
The service and the filet minion steak were both outstanding,4
"Anna, our server, was terrific.!",4
Advised ‚Äòanniversary‚Äô at time of booking. No reference to same made at the restaurant. Too bad no one reads these comments‚Ä¶ it was our 25th wedding engagement anniversary!,2
"Sat down asked for hot water 3 times, finally brought it the fourth time. appetiZer came quick but main course didn‚Äôt come until almost an hr after, when 50 min ago i asked the waitress ‚Äúis our main course ready?‚Äù She said ‚Äúits coming‚Äù then came 50min after. Then asked for bill and takeout boxes, brought the takeout boxes didn‚Äôt being the bill until 20min later. Food is okay, service not so good. BTW not first time going to Miller so i know normally how service should be, first time like this! Before was always good.",0
"Server was attentive and alert without hovering. Food was excellent but took a bit of time which was ok as we were enjoying drinks with our conversation.

The Miller apparently has invested in a COVID era hvac system which should help settle anxious minds.

Overall our rating is 5 stars.",4
So so nothing to write home about. Main was cold dessert was meh! Chocolate fondue was cold! Grrr Service was mediocre and price was high!!!!,2
Great experience! We love coming back each time at the Miller Tavern.,4
"Pricey for the quality of food, nice environment and good service.",2
Anna was amazing and very kind!!! Dinner was delicious!! And service was perfect!!!,4
"The atmosphere at Miller Tavern was great!  It wasn't too loud or noisy, but it was pretty full for a Saturday night.  Our server was great and very interactive and my mother-in-law had a great birthday.  Overall the food was fantastic.  I was disappointed with the steak; however.  Me and a friend both got the surf and turf and the steak was definitely lacking for a $150 plate.  The cut of meat wasn't the best and since we were at a steakhouse, my expectations were higher.",3
The first impression was when we were seated at the table with dirty table cloth. Service was ok. I waited for my steak for more then an hour and it was lunch time there were not too many people. It was not my first time coming to Miller but the most disappointing. Quality of food was terrible. Considering this it was overpriced.,0
The lobster club house sandwich was tasty but way too messy to eat.,4
"Overall a great dinner, nice ambience.  Food was awesome.  I had the Wagyu burger with fries that are sublime.  My only minor quibble is that we ordered oysters to start and then appetizers, but everything came at once.  Same thing with the pre-dinner cocktails; we were only half finished and the wine showed up.  Please pace the food and drinks appropriately.",4
Lovely afternoon out with friends.  Service was wonderful.  We‚Äôll be back.,4
"My wife and I went there to celebrate early Valentine's Day. The appetizer, oyster Rockefeller was awesome. My wife ordered the sirloin steak and it was cooked to almost perfection and I ordered the portabella mushroom  burger. I thought I would be getting a vegetarian burger but it was much better than expected. My burger came with a large portabella mushroom with lots of goat cheeses and it was super yummy! I would highly recommend this place.",4
Birthday celebration. Excellent food and service.,4
It was so good to go out without facing the closed door. Miller Tavern was always a treat for us and it remained very good place to go,4
Service a little slower than I'm used to waiter not very attentive.,3
Amazing service and food. Our first time out in months and The Miller remains one of my local goto favs.,4
Glad to have you open once again,4
"Excellent service, ambience and food on the first day of reopening!
Thank you.",4
So sad you are closing.  Hope your good staff returns.  Thank you for investing in the beautiful patio.,4
The restaurant is very comfortable with lots of space between tables. The waitress was excellent‚Äîfriendly and not overly attentive. The food was excellent with the minor exception being the salad dressing‚ÄîI found it was too vinegar-forward. That‚Äôs probably a personal preference.,4
The service was long but that is understandable it was the new year eve but the staff were very welcoming and very kind. The meal was very good.,4
"We had an early (6:30 pm) new year's eve reservation for 4.  From start to finish it was a very disappointing experience.  First, we were seated in the verandah right in front of the service door between the interior and verandah area. Arguably, the worst seat in the restaurant which was fairly empty at the time.  We moved ourselves a table over out of the drafty door since after waiting about 10 minutes no staff were in evidence. It went downhill from there. 
We were not aware it was a prix fix menu only.  After waiting approx 10 minutes a diffident waiter  finally took our order.  About 15 minutes later appetizers finally arrived.  All of the food was poorly prepared - much of it tasted like it had been hanging around for a day or so and reheated.  Some of it was truly unappetizing in appearance, e.g. a hunk of soggy beef wellington beside a blob of mashed potatoes on a plate looked like something from a high school cafeteria. Not even a sprig of parsley or rosemary to add some eye appeal.  I could go into more detail on the rest of the food but will  spare the reader.  $500 later NOT including alcohol, we just wanted to get out of there.",0
We are  satisfied with good services but they asking more tip than we expected. !((,3
Food and service are great. The lobster Mac and cheese are very tasty just the lobster are little less than I expert with the price of $37. Overall are great,4
Great experience,4
First class service. Very welcoming. People they are tying there it best. That deserve out support. Will go back again shortly.,4
Excellent. Would recommend. Our server was brilliant.,4
"Love the attention of our servicer , food was great. always brings back good memories of the old days.",3
Ask for Anna. She's fantastic. Would have given five stars but there's always room for improvement,3
Always fresh and delicious tipped our server $100 dollars he was that good and kind,4
"It was my first time visiting Miller Tavern and from booking to arrival to service and departure, I could not think of any other restaurant I would want to be at for a get together with a friend.  The food is delicious, though a tad too salty, and drinks sophisticated and enclosed patio surpassed my expectation for any first experience.",4
Steak was very poor and overdone. And at $65 way overpriced,2
"This was a meeting between 2 people who had not seen each other for 6 years. We picked something in the middle since she lives in the east and I in the west.

Location - excellent
Atmosphere perfect
Food mixed. We both ordered caser salad and chicken. The salad was not fresh and the chicken tasteless. The desert however made up for it all being spectacular.",2
I‚Äôve been to the restaurant a couple of time in last six weeks.  Food has been inconsistent.  Good first time.  Just ok this week.,2
14 December 2021,4
"Kenny, our waiter, is exceptional and truly made our dining experience excellent.",4
Food and service was excellent. I will definitely be back.,4
"We had booked upstairs but could not access because of a handicapped person in our group. So basically we had dinner in a bar at steakhouse restaurant prices. The food, compared to a similarly priced steakhouse was slightly below average.",1
The service was excellent. The food was good but just steak is too dry.,4
Still love the Miller but getting a little pricey,4
"We took our grandson for dinner. Anna helped make the occasion memorable, and made our grandson feel very special. Thanks Anna!",4
Awesome burger and fries. Great service!,4
A birthday! Excellent food. Thank you for putting the bday cake on the house!!!! Much appreciated üòäüòä,4
"We had a wonderful evening at the Miller Tavern.  Our food was excellently prepared and delicious.  The ambiance and where we were seated was perfect.
Our server, Anna Maria (I believe that was her name) (we were seated upstairs in the corner to the left of the top of the stairs) was very attentive and great.  She was always available, attended to our needs and went above and beyond to serve us with charm and a great personality.  Thanks for a lovely evening and birthday celebration for our dear friend.",4
The halibut was amazing.  Our server gave us recommendations and was very friendly and professional. Comphy atmosphere and I will continue to keep going back.,4
"The employee who supervised our Covid tracing check-in was not an overly warm individual - not a great start to our visit.  However Maria, our server, was delightful, knew everything about the menu and made us feel welcome.  
The food was very good, although somewhat over priced.
Overall a good experience and we look forward to a return visit.",3
Great spot for a group lunch. Well spaced out.,4
"First time trying, I loved it the food was amazing I believe our server was Paul and he was friendly and made great suggestions. I already want to go back!",4
"Very disappointed. This used to be my favourite restaurant. They changed the menu and took out my favourite chicken dish, service was awful and food was mediocre. Very unfortunate.",0
Took my friend out for his 40th and they did not disappoint. From the time of arrival to the time we left they were very organized and the server was very good. A little busy but at the end very attentive. Love it here and the food never disappoints.,4
Loved the whole experience. I would have liked to have stayed longer to listen to the band.,4
"Excellent food, perfect service, in a nice warm ambient, but slightly pricy. Desserts were delicious.",3
The appetizers were incredibly bland. Our waitress forced our party of 4 move to a tiny table because they were ‚Äúbusy‚Äù but there was only one other group of people eating there. Bad service and bad food.,0
"Ambience and service was great! Anna was our waitress and she was very helpful and professional. However, your prices for food and drinks are considerably expensive now which is making me hesitant to come back in the future.",2
"We only ate appetizers. 
Terrible quality overpriced",0
Absolutely fantastic experience,4
"A wonderful night with my besties. Great food, wine and conversation n",4
The service is always great. Anna was wonderful!,3
Initially there was some confusion as to happy hour and inconsistent information in electronic menu. This ended up being resolved by the staff and management with sincere apologies. The atmosphere is consistent over the years I've been visiting here. During the rush hours it can get pretty noisy.,3
It's wonderful to support a restaurant where the delicious food is matched by great service.,4
"Hannah was a delight from start to finish 
She‚Äôs such a pleasure. You can see her smile even through the mask",4
"Just out with a co worker for a bite
The menu is very expensive for a casual dinner
It would unfortunately, make me re-think going there again unless for a special occasion. The staff were all wonderful, ambiance good. Food not so amazing especially for the price",3
The service was excellent but the food was disappointing and expensive. The fries were greasy and too salty; the Reuben was mostly cheese and Russian dressing with too little meat; the Caesar salad was adequate but not inspired.,2
Their prices are ridiculous. Do they think they are Scaramouche?  What a joke.,2
"Great food, service and ambience. Love this place.",4
"The temperature in the area where we were seated was very cold despite the fact that it was cold outside, it seemed like there was no heat on. 
Service was good but my Waldorf Salad was mediocre. Not good value for the price of the salad. I've been here several times before and both the ambience and the food quality was better previously.",1
"The new version of the Miller burger sucks! Bring the old one back. Also, $30 for a burger is a little ridiculous if you ask me.",4
"Enjoyed our dinner 
Food was very good.
Not happy with service
2nd. floor was clod.
Asked the waiter for possibility to turn the fan above our table off but no action taken.",2
"A great place to have a meal with friends. It's quiet, so easy to talk, and has a wonderful ambience. The food is delicious as well, albeit a little pricy as the Miller is a bit upscale (not your standard pub). A great place for special occasions.",4
"Overall, the dining experience was good.  One entree, however, the lobster sandwich was not as good as expected.  There were basically 2 pieces of lobster in the sandwich and the bread was too thick.",2
Fine food and service. Music was too loud and it required us to raise our voices.,3
"Great food, professional service, relaxing ambiance.",4
Very noisy but everything else good.,4
"Maria our server was absolutely stellar.   She was able to clearly articulate the menu,  she has tasted the items on the menu and made great recommendations.   We were very impressed with her overall.   She has a lovely personality and spirit.   Highly recommend. 
T",4
"Our group of 5 enjoyed a variety of food selections from an amazing menu and the food was served hot, with great service, very timely and, ""everyone"" found their meals delicious! The steak special was cooked to perfection for 2 and then the lentil/bean dish, burger and rissotto were consumed without any leftovers. - perfect! Complimenting the meals were 2 bottles of old age Chianti very reasonably priced at $50 each.  Great fun and great value:)",3
"Not enough parking to accommodate every one.  This has been a problem for years.
Service very good,  Covid precautions were excellent.  Felt very comfortable.

Terrace room very noisy but that is the price you pay for enjoying the lovely view and the sunshine.  Worth the difficult conversations.",2
Good food.  Excellent services.  Relaxing atmosphere.,4
"the food wasnt good at all , we tried the steak and didnt enjoy it that much",0
Awesome as alway! Service was top notch! Attentive and caring.,4
I always enjoy my meals at the Miller. The food is excellent and the waiters don‚Äôt rush you.,4
Wonderful experience! Great food! Great atmosphere! Great service!,4
"Disappointed overall. Food was fair at best. The service was inconsistent. The value for dollar is not there.
Wouldn‚Äôt rush to go back.",2
"Very disappointing. Had a great meal in the summer. Took too long for the food. Reservations at 7:30 main courses came at 9:15. Burgers overcooked, greasy bun‚Ä¶.",0
We went there for a family gathering.  We all enjoyed dining there.,4
"Food: sides and top shelf $300 steak arrived cold. When mentioned to server that food could be warmer, instead of offering to warm up the steak we were provided with excuse as to why it is cold - it‚Äôs the cut. Lobster tail rubbery and appeared pre-cooked in advance. 

Ambiance: this place is desperately in need of a renovation if they are to continue with their price strategy.",0
The food was not tasty. The price was too high for the quality pf the food they served.,0
Manager was excellent! Great service and love the new menu,4
Just a little too noisy but otherwise fantastic. Wait staff were all friendly and very attentive and professional,4
I enjoyed the squash salad‚Ä¶new on the menu. My two friends were happy with their choices of Caesar salads,3
"Our server had a very load voice. He also posted the wine really fast, rushed it to the glass",3
Lovely spot to meet up with friends for a lovely lunch. Felt very safe with the efforts they make to ensure everyone is safe.,4
With friends from out of town,4
"Something's happened to Miller Tavern!  It's transformed from a good place to eat into a destination dining spot.  We were welcomed into the well-spaced dinning area and presented with their new ""winter"" menu.  There was something for everyone, great traditional offerings like steak tartare and french onion soup, and some twists on old favourites like the burrata Waldorf.  When we ordered oysters I was delighted to hear that they only offer the very best oysters - Raspberry Point.  I wish they still had the fillet on the menu because the steak choices were rather large (much to my sons delight) and I think the atmosphere would be improved by dimming the lights.  They had great fish, vegetarian and vegan option(s) and the creamy truffle lobster mac & cheese was hard to say no to.  I wonder how everyone feels about the music - we liked it, nice, friendly folksy fiddling, although my son said when he went to the washroom it sounded like there was a fiddler on cocaine playing directly behind him - ha!",4
The food was fresh and delicious.  They had a string quartet playing which added to the ambience.  It was a special birthday celebration.,4
"The appetizers were good, but the main (lamb shank) was inedible.

Nice ambiance but the food seems to have declined since the pandemic, and the quality is no longer in alignment with the prices.

Would not reccomend.",2
We received exceptional service.  Prices have increased and I believe the overall value and atmosphere do not match the high end menu.,3
"Had checked the menu before I booked as we had wanted filets (steak). 
We were booked for 6.00pm. They tried to seat us in a cold verandah, then in a back room, finally ended up in a booth for 2. The restaurant was not busy at this time.
When the menu came it was total different from the one online, and no filets. We were told that the menu changed that day. There was nothing on the menu that we wanted so we left.
The front desk and waiter were cool and did not present a warm and friend atmosphere you would expect in a local restaurant.
Will not go back or recommend.",0
"Hello!
I took my friend for a Birthday lunch. The service, food, drinks, atmosphere, service was absolutely amazing. We will definitely be back. Also, the tavern burger is probably the best burger I've ever had!!",4
"The waiter, a Russian man, seemed to be very inexperienced and could use some training in the niceties of table service.",3
"We asked if they could dim the lights and they complied, we were very grateful and impressed. Helpful with wine and food selections. Overal, very pleasant experience",3
Our waiter Kenny was incredible. Amazing customer service. Food was delicious and overall a great evening at Miller Tavern.,4
Outstanding service! Lots of staff attentive to our needs. Food cooked to our exact specifications. We were be very Impressed that they are strictly adhering to COVID guidelines.,4
"Great meal, great service great food. It was unfortunate that we had difficulty hearing each other at a four person table",3
"Service met expectations - calm, unobtrusive, thorough.
Prices were outrageously inflated since prior visit.  This isn't Morton's! 
Food was acceptable, but not special - and with a few misses.  Dessert was dry as sawdust.",2
"Great to be able to visit again 
Food and service always good. Despite wearing a mask we could see the welcoming smile in our servers eyes.",3
"Monica, one of the best servers at The Miller!
Friendly, attentive, just say ‚Äúfeed me‚Äù and she knows what to my liking on the menu!
We will return soon!
Rick",4
A regular spot that we love . Best roast beef sandwich and lobster roll around,4
"My food was cold and the steak was over cooked. They did their best to make up for it but clearly they were under staffed, and the place was jammed. It was a bit chaotic. We had to wait a long time for our food to come to the table.",3
Lovely place. Service and food are good but the price doesn't worth it.,3
"Our waitress and Hostess Anna was outstanding and we always have frequent it to Miller
The muscles and tries were out of this world",4
Good food but a bit pricy.  We went early so wemissedthenoise.,3
Business dinner. Service was great and food was done well,3
Service is absolutely horrible. Our waiter never gave us his name nor did he check to see how our food was which by the way was very poor in taste. Not going back. Save your money.,0
Great meal. I love the sea bream ! Oysters Rockefeller were a bit salty. My first time inside any restaurant since covid. Glad to see you properly checking vaccine status and contact tracing! We‚Äôll be back.,3
Good choice.,3
"Almost perfect. Some patrons were too loud for an enclosed dining room. Besides that, excellent.",4
"The host didn't ask from my vaccination status and pretended that he forgot when I proactively showed him my proof of vax and ID.  This made me significantly uncomfortable. 
The comfort in eating out is based on the fact that everyone around us is double vaxxed.  If that's not the case, I prefer not to eat at your restaurant.",1
The server we had was fantastic,4
Delicious food and good service!,3
"Very nice mid to upper tier steak house. Broad menu of favourites (something for everyone). Nice space, food is vey good and excellent service . And there is free parking!",3
"Our group thoroughly enjoyed our lunch at the Miller Tavern. This was the first visit for several of the members and they raved about the facilities, food, ease of access to the restaurant and the parking. The intent is to return again in the near future!",3
Very good overall but the music was too loud.,3
Went to the Miller Tabern for my Mother in laws birthday. I felt the menu was slightly limited for a lunch but the food did surpass my expectations.,3
We spent our anniversary here and we were VERY well taken care of. The server was funny and endearing and the food was excellent. They have a French pastry chef whose lemon tart is TO DIE FOR.  It is truly spectacular. A truly romantic and special evening.,4
"Deliciously wonderful place to celebrate a birthday.  Excellent service and the food was delicious without a long wait. 
Not cheap but worth it for a special evening!",3
Server forced us to leave at 90 minute mark. No gave us another 5 minute you have to leave chat even though there was NO one waiting for a table!! It was the end of lunch. She didn‚Äôt ask any one else  to leave. I couldn‚Äôt finish my tea. She didn‚Äôt bring the milk for my tea until asked for it after 10 minutes. Never brought the lime for the water. Horrible! Never returning,0
"The appetizers were delicious.  However, the main course (mussels) was not.  The sauce taste like watered-down milk.  We couldn't finish it.  The manager offered not to charge us for that dish, which was nice; but we were still left with memory of an unpleasant experience.",3
"The ambience was lovely , noisy because of the work being done on the side street.
Our wait staff were pleasant and very willing to accommodate.However, the group felt for the food requested  the prices were rather high.",1
"Fantastic meal once again; indoors this time, served by a terrific waiter who was not only pleasant but lots of fun.  We really could have stayed until dinner time but of course would have had to be driven home--delicious food, great wine, cannot say enough good things about the Miller and hope to be back again very soon.",4
"Excellent burger, always enjoy it.",4
Outstanding service by Craig.,4
"Was able to eat outside (for lunch) in late October and the ambiance was lovely. Our server was helpful and efficient, although a smile would not have hurt :-). Food was top quality and always appreciate the easy parking. 
I had not been here in a few years and will be returning, especially for outdoor dining",4
"The outdoor patio was so beautiful, it felt like we were on vacation. The food was quite delicious and our server was excellent. We had a heater next to our table as it was quite chilly out. We were very comfortable.",4
A little too expensive. Appetizers should be bigger.,3
"Really love their patio.  Comfortable seating and plants, louvered roof and wonderful heat lamps. Tables well spaced.  Great service.  Menu choices are limited especially when they are out of some items. Overall would return.",3
We had a lovely late afternoon patio visit.  Lovely wine and food.  The Lobster Bisque was so good and the triple cooked fries.  Thank you Anna for the great service!  Will be back for sure.,4
Special Birthday,4
"We went to the Miller for lunch and a little catch up with a friend.   The salad with chicken was delicious and fresh.
lovely fall day with great service and super weather.",4
"We had a waitress that seemed less than enthused.
Her partner took over and he was delightful.",4
"Good food, best patio in the city. Our server was having a bad day.",2
"We enjoy dining at The Miller Tavern. Service is attentive. However, I find it annoying when they won't accommodate a simple request like "" can I have soup with my sandwich instead of fries or a salad?"" The answer was, ""no, we don't do that"" I was prepared to pay a few bucks more for the request. It seems like they are missing the point of being in ""the SERVICE industry""   I've had a few other instances of this kind of ""service,"" I wish they would be more accommodating; we might go there more often.",2
"Amazing service from Peter, as always. He brought a smile to all of our faces during a difficult time",4
"The greeting and Covid Protocols were handled quickly and efficiently by the very courteous staff.  Our waiter was a pro, and excellent service.  The Turkey club was tasty and the fries, just right, perfectly cooked.

Look forward to the next visit",4
The chef doesn't know the difference between a hard boiled egg and a poached egg.,2
We thought the menu was poor and the prices were high‚Ä¶..,1
"The food was great except the cake at the end. Pasta, steak and appetizers were delicious. Service and ambiance were outstanding! We will definitely be back",4
"Service was very slow, we had to ask a few times for things and wait and wait...",1
By far my new favourite restaurant. Have been twice in two weeks and am even more impressed the second time. The service was amazing and the food was beyond incredible. It really is a gem.,4
Outstanding patio experience.  Sea breen was delicious.  Wine was very good. Service Excellent.,4
"Great outdoor table - nice and private for a catch up with a friend.
Lovely buratta salad.",4
"Our family has patronized the Miller for many years and watched the changes.  Our experience on Sunday was amazing.  The changes in decorating, outside furniture and beauty, the menu and the quality of the food was outstanding.
We had superior friendly service.
We will dine again soon and look forward to enjoying the entertainment. 

Many thanks",4
We enjoy the beautiful surroundings in the backyard of Miller Tavern.  It would be perfect if there were more vegetarian options on the menu.,3
First date with a gentleman here. The service was exceptional. The food fabulous. Ambience couldn‚Äôt have been better.,4
Beautiful patio in the summer and nice cozy bar in the winter!  They used to have more appie share options like dumplings etc that miss but the food is still decent.,4
Had an amazing time with my friends. Loved the ambiance. Food was a bit pricey and on slimmer portions. Service was very good.,4
The service was very slow and the portion for the meal I ordered was also quite small. The server was very nice but there were not enough servers and/or kitchen staff. Nice atmosphere for outdoor dining.,2
Friendly staff take the time to welcome you and celebrate your special occasion with you.,4
"Filet mignon was perfectly prepared, seafood platter was over- priced , everything seemed to have come straight out of the freezer, and the chopped salad looked good at first but consisted mostly of lettuces bathed in a rather artless dressing.",4
One of the worst steak I have ever had. So dry and tasteless. My first and last time there. $58 for such a dreadful steak! What a waste of money it was.,0
"I wish I recalled our server's name as she was wonderful. And the food was perfect. We (five of the six of us) ended up ordering the sea bream and it was excellent. I have no doubt that the other dishes on the menu would be just as good.  My only wish is if there could be a vegetian/vegan main dish avaible (not just pasta) as there used to be one. Otherwise great service, food and ambiance (we were on the patio).",4
The food was awesome and our waitress was so great! It was our anniversary and they brought us Champaign and made us feel so special! We sat on the patio and it was so beautiful with the string lights. We will definitely be back!,4
"I have had such awful experiences with restaurants these days I am thrilled to give a big thumbs up to the Miller Tavern. We were on the patio, the food was delicious and worth every penny, and the service was terrific.  Really great lunch. Well done.",4
"Amazing ambience! Heated patio with beautiful lighting. Fantastic waitress who was knowledgeable, prompt and very friendly. Wagu burger and muscles and fries were delicious!!",4
"Wonderful atmosphere on patio. Felt very safe and comfortable. 

Speakers with music playing were a bit too loud; had a bit of difficulty hearing my friend. 

Good was delicious. Steak tartar was fabulous.  Oysters Rockefeller were yummy, but overpriced - I got 3 tiny shells for $19!  I would have expected double die the price. 

My friend had fish n chips and really liked them. Large cut Fries were very good. She didn‚Äôt like the slaw.  

Service was great.  

Tip - your food will come very quickly after you order it; I knew that and after we got our drink order I asked them to come back in 10 min. Which they did and sure enough food was delivered within 10 min after that.   

Overall very enjoyable.",3
"Lovely late lunch at Miller to celebrate a birthday. Server was knowledgeable of the menu options, made a great wine recommendation and was super friendly and polite. Seafood platter was very tasty, shrimp size was impressive. The Tuna tartar was also really tasty. Not a cheap outing, but we will definitely be back again when we have another special occasion to celebrate.",3
Nice weather and good service. The staff were very pleasant and courteous food was delicious. I have been there twice in the past 3 weeks and made another reservation for coming Saturday. I like your location and the garden is gorgeous. Having heaters above each table is a wonderful idea,4
"Great food, excellent service, good social distance",4
I love the design of the rather large patio and the food is excellent.  I was there for lunch and had the crab cake and the Greek salad and I loved both.  Service is always excellent.,4
"The whole TEAM at the Miller Tavern are exceptional, from the hosting, servers, bartenders , embrace the whole customer experience.
 6 of us sat in the the lovely romantic patio,  beautiful d√©cor, high standard furnishing and cleanliness. We celebrated a 22nd birthday , food was delicious.  Service was outstanding!!
We look forward to many more experiences at the Miller Tavern",4
"Wine selection was good - recommend the Malbec.
Sea Breem had a lot to be desired - overcooked and not as tasty as it should have been.  I would not order that dish again.",3
Great ambiance and the heaters were great for comfort,4
"it was perfect. in front of tv.

very comfortable seating.....just like being at home.

we will be back very soon",3
"The setting is lovely.  The ceiling heaters help immensely as the evenings become cooler.  The service was timely, polite and helpful.  The food was exceptional.  I will be back soon!",4
We sat on the patio and were not asked for proof of vaccination - very concerning.,0
A lovely environment for outdoor dining!  A great surprise!,4
very central location for out of town get togethers. Lots of parking and convenience. Staff very accommodating. Excellent menu choices!,4
"The Burrata Waldorf salad is not worth the price of $25. It was mostly lettuce, some of which was brown. My guest had the chop salad which she did not finish. Brown lettuce was evident in it as well.",3
We ate on the outdoor patio which was quite a lovely setting. The service was attentive and the food outstanding. Highly recommend.,3
It's been a treat to come to the Miller patio a few times in the last 2 years - food is outstanding and the COVID protocols are very well organized. Staff are great.,4
Excellent as we have come to expect.,4
"Everything was excellent, nothing I would ask to have been different or better. Worth every dollar I paid. Highly recommend the Wagyu Burger and 8oz Filet.",4
"Food was good. Hostess/ s are very aggressive and rude.  Not sure what they are trying to demonstrate by that attitude but definitely unpleasant. 
They have lost our business for good, thanks to their unwelcoming tone and extremely poor service. 
The manager is a wonderful lady, needs to invest in extensive interpersonal staff training.",1
"Very nice restaurant and very nice food. Right now, only the outdoor space is open. You may want to dress warm. We ordered sea food platter and fish for main course. The taste is really good and it is very healthy.",4
Good food in a great location. I do recommend if you want to enjoy a eating outside.,4
"Great service, great server (Anna) and good food. We arrived on time and waited a couple of minutes and were shown to our table. We were treated as guests compared to some restaurants who think they are the guests!",4
"The restaurant was excellent!
We appreciated their Covid protocols ,when we arrived, as we were asked to complete a questionnaire for contact tracing purposes.  


The service and food were very good.

Their seafood was very fresh and delicious, as were all the items we had for dinner.

I highly recommend the Miller Tavern!",4
This place had a great service and the food was really really good. But what I loved the most about this place was the ambiance. We had a table in the patio and we just loved it. Highly recommended for special occasions.,4
Food was amazing and staff went above and beyond. The interior needs a Reno as it feels very pub like and tired but everything else was amazing. The outside patio is a much nicer vibe but was too cold and they didn‚Äôt have heaters.,4
"Love this place. Delicious surf and turf options, excellent service and the outdoor patio is perfect!",4
On the patio on a gorgeous day for lunch with family. Very good service. Excellent ambiance.,3
"The food was fantastic, as always, as was the setting. We had a wonderful meal, and a wonderful experience, with the family just as kids are starting to disappear again. My one regret was that we only ordered one bowl of mac and cheese with truffels. I had some of my daughter's and really should have had my own.",4
"Service was excellent.
Meal was underwhelming. Ordered the mussels with frites (skinny fries) and was served chunky wedge potatoes.",3
Go here at least once weekly. Love the new patio  Nothing better anywher3 in this price range,4
Very good ambiance and access to Veranda was good as weather gets cooler.   Menu choices are a bit limited.  Service was excellent.,4
"As always, very pleasant ambience.
Had to negotiate a different table, which was dealt with very quickly.
Service staff very attentive,
Highly recommend the Wagyu burger, which was delicious but messy to eat !
A nice evening, in pleasant surroundings, with good food and service.
Thanks !",3
"This is one of my very favourite restaurants.  The ambience, the food, and the service is always excellent.",4
"Anna Marie was a treat for service and Willy came by to say a friendly hello.
My client as well as me loved the food!",4
"The Miller is a great place to meet another couple on a sunny day for lunch on the multi-level patio.  Our waiter Phil provided excellent service - both friendly and efficient.  We especially enjoyed the Greek salad, portabello burger and sea bream.  For sure we will return!",4
"From the time we arrived until we left we were so impressed by staff,patio,food and our table. I used to go there in 1960's when there was skating under the trees close to the river and to see the transformation was a lovely surprise. we dined there when it was first redone but inside only and loved it then. Thought prices were over the top but it was a special day for us  so well worth it thank-you,  margaret",4
Amazing food and service. Loved their sea food collection,4
"We enjoyed our lunch on the patio. Excellent food, service and ambiance. Highly recommend",4
Everything us good for the price except the shrimp cocktail,4
"Great location, ambience, and food.  Excellent service and overall experience.  Can‚Äôt say enough about this place and how well our event was managed !!! Loved it and so did the birthday party.",4
Food is always amazing. Ambiance was great (ate on the large patio). My only suggestion is that they should give you crusty bread when ordering the mussels rather than making the customer order a side of toast. I‚Äôve never ordered mussels where I then had to order a side of bread.,4
"We celebrated my boyfriends birthday, booked last minute using the open table app and were blown away at how easy it was and how organized they were when we arrived ten mins later. We had a great meal, food was incredible and extremely friendly service!",4
"Limited selection and expensive offerings. Burgers were served on a soggy bun. Waiters were not easy to flag
Down if we needed condiments. Disappointing, overall!",2
"M husband and I had a very nice dinner. However his hamburger was overdone. We commented on it but didn‚Äôt want to wait fir a fresh one to be cooked. We ordered coffees and 1 dessert and the waitress very nicely said ‚Äúcoffees and dessert were on her‚Äù. Does it actually come out of her pay or does the restaurant comp this?
Waitress was very nice and accommodating.",3
"The patio was one of the most beautiful I‚Äôve been on and the historical building and ambience was lovely. Staff were gracious and accommodating.  Drinks and Food‚Ä¶Meh.  I have no problem spending money if we  enjoy the food.  However, it was expensive for food that was not impressive.  We read reviews and decided to try anyways.  Still a good experience, but could‚Äôve been great if the food was tastier.",3
Very attentive service but Calamari appetizer is rubbery / almost inedible,3
I met with friends that I have not seen in awhile.  We had a wonderful visit on the patio.  The service and food were good and we could hear each other.,4
We ordered 4 appetizers.  The steak tartare and calamari were delicious.  I found the crab cake fishy but everyone else loved it. The tomato feta and olive galette was delicious.  For dinner we had the rib eye steak and fries‚Ä¶delicious. And for desert a lemon tart and Prosecco.  Also delicious.  Our server was lovely and organized. The Covid protocols and social distancing was perfect.  We had no worries all evening and an overall very good night,4
"Good food, lovely setting and excellent service.",4
"We loved the Miller, had superb service but unfortunately had stomach upset following eating the tomato tart appetizer. This does not happen to us, we eat and enjoy all foods. There wa something not right with that tart.",3
It was a great evening. The food was wonderful!,4
"I had requested a table on the second level patio. Instead we were seated on the first level.
How can we specify a patio level and actually get it?",4
"The food was good but drinks not so much. 
Chocolate cake very dry and tasteless",3
"The Miller tavern tries hard to stay open despite all the challenges
Need to be supported a a valuable neighbourhood restaurant
Our experience was acceptable albeit mediocre
Best feature: the parking",2
"Excellent experience!  The food was delicious, and the service was great!",4
Food not great. Fish was over cooked. Decor - what decor? Very loud noise from construction nearby...won't go until the work is done.,3
Unfortunately the calamari dissapointed this visit. Tasted like scraps of fried crumbs. I've had them many times here before but something was off today. On a positive note the prossecco was excellent!,2
"Beautiful place to be! 
ü•òüç∫


food server are very friendly and got good taste  for recommending desserts! We love lemon meringue pie!üßÅüòãü§©",4
Yummy food! Beautiful patio! Great service! Would definitely return!,4
"Their outdoor patio is lovely, adorned with seasonal flowers and gentle lighting. Our server was excellent and made excellent food and drink suggestions. This time was better than I remembered it being, so I'm going to say they stepped up a notch from last year. I had the Sea Bream which had an excellent crispy skin, and my husband had the 12 oz strip which was cooked just right. Our drinks were tasty and the bartender modified both of them to suit our needs. I'd definitely go back and would recommend for friends.",4
I will definitely return to this establishment many times in the future.,4
"Three out of four meals, two fish and a fillet mignon were excellent.  The fourth was a skinny rib eye steak which was unexpected given the cost...and therefore disappointing.
Our table was not the best, near the great new bar, but we could hear the traffic zooming by on Yonge Street.
Next time...a different table and no rib eye!",3
"From the moment we arrived, we felt rushed by our server who was pushing the wine specials on us and seemed annoyed that we weren‚Äôt ordering enough alcohol.
The food was good, although overpriced. The best thing about this place is the ambiance, which is amazing and why we go back. However, we were rushed in and out in 1 Hour!!
After spending $150.00 we figured we would be allot to relax and enjoy at least a little more time, but had MULTIPLE servers ask if we were ready to pay our bill!!! NOT COOL!!!",2
"Greek salad was very good with lots of different kinds of tomatoes.  The sea brine was delicious.   Beautiful, large patio.   Service was excellent.  Staff were very attentive.",3
A great restaurant with good service. Reception was good and Server Dimitri was just a great staff in making recommendations and provided excellent service!,4
"Knowledgeable, friendly and professional service.  Most beautiful patio in Toronto and the verandah offers the best of both worlds.  Food was very good, especially the Scottish salmon dish and the toffee pudding.  A bit pricey but worth it for an overall lovely experience.",3
"The Miller Tavern has become one of my favourite eating haunts.  I love the 
ambiance and atmosphere.  Of Course, most important, the food and service
was impeccable.",4
"Superb of everything. Escargots were do do, but overall all fantastic. Still will come back,  ; escargots will eat next time at the keg‚Ä¶ it were hood, but nothing special for the prices",4
"Fabulous service, beautiful outdoor patio, the food was delicious!
Thank you to all that made it a fabulous experience!

Be back again soon!",4
"the food is amazing as well as the environment 

Just got annoyed with a table next to us, people got drunk and talking very loud, however management moved us away from that table",4
"Nice restaurant location,  lots of free parking,  comfortable patio seating,  pleasant dining ambiance. Nice tasting food.  Personally found mushrooms croquettes greasy but other menu items were tasty   eg. Mussels with fennel delicious ,  steak perfectly prepared, tomato galette flavourful, good coffee.  Kudos to your whole team, in particular professional server Maria, and personable wine expert Angelo. Thanks",4
"Delish food, nice surroundings and perfect service.",4
"Terrific, attentive friendly and efficient staff.
Amazing steak tartar and very tasty prime rib sandwich. 
Very enjoyable experience for us. We will return. Thank you",4
"I have been to Miller Tavern twice in 3 weeks. And likely never again!~
The food was horrible, a hair in my chicken caesar salad yesterday for lunch and a. very mediocre salmon dish prior.Moreover the service was slow the waiter- might have been the same both times, and was slow, inattentive with a smattering of attitude. The coffee turned colled but he refilled despite our suggestion for a fresh serving. In the end he settled on a fresh serving, and asked me yesterday if I was hungry when I asked for the bill!!!",0
"Great place with beautiful patio, staff are super friendly and they have great selection of appetizers and main course.",4
"Oh, how I love this place! Their servers are an absolute gem. My filet mignon was amazing,  the servers were amazing, the atmosphere is great - feels like you're visiting someone's fancy home and you're being treated like a very important guest. I've always admired that this place is located in a somewhat posh location, but regardless of how old you are or what your financial situation is, the servers make you feel like a million bucks! Although on Friday they were short-staffed because the servers worked as a team, there wasn't even a hint of slow service (thank you!).

The food is amazing.",4
"Sept 2
Really nice haven‚Äôt been there in years. Will return",4
"Great restaurant, a little on the pricey side. Parking lot is too small and pay parking may be required. Overall‚Ä¶ I would go back.",3
"I had a wonderful lunch with my 3 sons (in their twenties), and I'd like to make this an annual end of summer event.",4
"Great service, lovely patio and wonderful lobster rolls! I love The Miller in Hogs Hollow!",4
"Just two small issues
Took a long time for food to arrive - about an hour but as always was delicious
One in our party had a bug in her wine and rather than bring her another glass of wine they just proceeded to pour from the bottle we ordered into a new glass so the person in our party said no please bring me another glass of wine
Of course that affected the tip",3
The pasta was dry and a small portion.  1.5 hour seating limit per table is unreasonable.  It should be at least 2 hours.,2
A very enjoyable experience of great service and food.,3
"The reservation policy is absolutely ridiculous.
If you come early, just for a drink, they make you wait 
outside, even that you know there are lots of vacant
seats and tables inside.
The wait staff were excellent but at the door no one
seems to be in charge, and can‚Äôt make a decision.
It‚Äôs a shame, it‚Äôs a nice patio.
Jim.",1
An outstanding venue for great food in a relaxed ambience.,4
"I loved our table location
Our server was excellent
The food was almost perfect. My only suggestion to make it even better is regarding the lobster roll.

The New England lobster roll had delicious, fresh tasting and well seasoned lobster.

My issue is that the roll the lobster was on was not the best choice. It was too hard and a bit too thick.

The best lobster rolls in New England have lusciously soft, buttered buns that are specifically designed for this dish. Something like an upscale hot fog bun split at the top.

If that had been used for this menu item, it would have been perfect.

My dinner companion had the beef dip which looked delicious and is something I will order on my next visit.

The Miller patio, food and service are definitely worth a visit.

"Comfy seating, chill, cool patio",4
"Interesting menu. Items delivered as described. Ample portions. Superb service.
Ask NOT to be seated at the round table near the first set of stairs and serving station - too busy an area.
Dessert menu is on the heavy side.Create more light, summery dishes with fresh berries, etc.",4
"The verandah was fabulous with great views and a nice flow of air.
Food was excellent, great Caesar salad!",4
The staff that worked at our table was very accommodating and helpful.  Terrific Service,4
Birthday celebration,4
"Beautiful setting, delicious food, excellent service!",4
"Everything combined was really nice.
Especially the food and service.",4
"I've written this review many times and, as always, everything was as it should be.  Terrific setting, fabulous food, polite, friendly efficient service; a wonderful place to dine whether it be lunch or dinner.  Already looking forward to my next visit this coming Thursday.",4
Another fabulous dining experience. Thanks!,4
Perfect afternoon lunch with a very friendly and efficient waitress .... Anna.,4
Food and ambience are great. Servers lack personality and don‚Äôt make the extra effort.,3
"Great patio upgrades, good food and great company!!",4
Lovely mid-day dining experience on a great patio.  Excellent service.  Thanks all round.,4
"Delicious food and impeccable service made our visit memorable. The only downside was the huge TV screen on the top patio. Even though we sat on the level below, the screen was distracting and unwelcome. TV screens have a place in bars, but not at fine restaurants. If we go again, I would ask to be seated where the screen is not visible.",3
"The Miller tavern was outstanding! Service, food, drinks, everything was awesome. Will be coming back for sure! Our server Harley was amazing! So kind and caring",4
"Everything was perfect after we got seated I made a reservation early in the week and specified outdoor seating. When we got there, the hostess wanted to put us indoors by an open window. I told her we reserved outdoor and she said it was the same because the windows were open, and they had no room on the patio. 
We said we wanted to wait for the patio because that‚Äôs what I had reserved and she said it will be quite a while. We then told her we will wait. At that point she said they have a table. When we got to the patio they actually gave us a choice where to sit. 
So I don‚Äôt understand what the hostess at the front entrance problem was. Otherwise, server and the food was terrific. 
The hostess gets a generous 1 star.",2
Food was delicious. Service beyond excellent. Our server was so attentive. Ambiance was beautiful,4
Good service,4
My teen kids and I had a wonderful dinner on the patio! Superb service and ambiance.,4
Was a pleasant afternoon spent in a nice environment with great service and good food.,4
"So good to be back.  All aspects of our early Sunday night dinner contributed to a most relaxing, enjoyable experience.",4
"Excellent atmosphere, good food, fast service.  Always enjoyed the patio experience.",4
"A beautiful, spacious and shaded outdoor space for dining, surrounded by greenery. The service was very pleasant and unobtrusive and there were plenty of servers to ensure you were never waiting for anything. They were very kind and patient with my older guest's difficulties with the contact tracing and menu apps. The meals were wonderful - the chop salad and steak tartare particularly recommended.  The bacon quality in both the chop salad and the sandwich was wonderful, a thick, juicy and maple-flavoured cut, and the greens were very fresh. I had the salmon with my chop salad and it was cooked exactly as I ordered it, really delicious. Mains and appetizers were phenomenal, dessert so-so. The espresso is fine but not top-notch, and the panna cotta wasn't really panna cotta, it was more like a parfait of very dry cake crumbs over an inch of a pleasant, tangy custard.",4
Our waitress was terrific and very attentive.  The only reason we did not give five stars is the service from the back end.  Drinks and dinner seemed to take a very long time to come even though we were there at 9:00 pm and not peak dinner service time.,3
"Server James was great but unfortunately it stopped there. Martinis are just about 1 1/2 ounces but they charge $16.00. Food can be compared to at best - cafeteria food. We ordered fish and chips which was drenched in oil and literally could see the oil dripping onto the plate. The other dish was Sea Bream which tasted bland.  We also ordered the  tomato and feta salad which was made with tomatoes that you would find in the middle of winter. Overall : 
2 martinis
1 vodka soda
1 salad
2 entrees
Total $170 including gratuity 
NOT priceless but OVERPRICED",0
Very pleasant atmosphere with good food,4
It was great,3
The food and ambience were really good!,4
"Lovely ambience, especially in the evening. Fabulous service r. Great food, nicely presented.",4
Made a reservation for the patio and got a table inside instead. I was told that was what was available.,2
"The Miller Tavern is a hidden gem and has always been one of my favorites! On this occasion,  my birthday, it was no exception. The ambience of the patio is stunning, the staff are terrific, kind and courteous and the food was great. Of course, we will definitely go there again and we would definitely recommend it to anyone!
Brian Abbey",4
Thought price pt for Fish / chips was out of line for a very basic looking plate... did not order.,4
"Patio makeover is outstanding and finally quality furniture to sit on. Staff are always pleasant and friendly. 
Menu is definitely targeting seafood or fancy eaters. It lacks a few simple options for people who don‚Äôt like fuss and fish! 
A few years back they had a snack menu that was great - I wish they would bring it back!!  We still enjoy going just don‚Äôt really eat much there now unfortunately.",3
A hidden gem if you don't already know this place.  Outdoor patio with lush greens around.  Good food.  Fried calamari is lightly battered and delicious.  So is their lobster roll.,4
Birthday for friend,4
"Overall we had a good time.  Food, ambiance were fine.  But I think the prices were a bit too high.  But we will come back.  Thank you.  Keep up the good work.",4
waiter was a bit loud and in certain instances he came across as indiscreet.,2
Excellent overall.,4
"Dinner was amazing, we throughly enjoyed ourselves!  Thank you",3
Food tasty service good,4
"Our server Menu was very thoughtful and professional.  He saw where we were sitting outside and adjusted the shade for us.  It was so hot that we moved indoors and we were still able to have the same server, Menu.  He was attentive but not intruding and was great!  Look forward to coming back as always.",3
"Patio is very nice.  Our server was patient, attentive and courteous.  Staff was accomodating for our toddler and worked around his car seat.  Complimentary champage for our foursome to celebrate my wife's birthday was a nice touch.",4
"Had a wonderful server.
Ambiance keeps bringing us back",4
It is certainly a beautiful setting! We were outside on patio. Service was excellent as was food. We will definitely be back. Thank you for letting us stay a little longer.,4
"A quaint,  charming and romantic spot to capture any diner's heart. The ambiance is perfect with attention to detail in food presentation, service and comfort. A special spot under twinkling lights to savour high quality food.",4
It was ok. The food was good but not outstanding for the price being charged. For example $24 for one (1) crab cake as an appetizer or a dinner salad with salmon was $38.,3
"Excellent service and ambience, tasty food; much appreciated the complimentary proseco in celebration of our anniversary.",4
"We were fortunate to get an outside table as our reservation stated.  There was some hesitancy at check in.  The service was great, the food appreciated and the serving staff excelled.",3
We had a wonderful lunch and appreciated the attentive staff.,4
It was amazing,4
The outdoor patio is beautiful. The food was great for the price. Would definitely go back for a nice casual meal,4
"Once again food and service over the top!
The Miller has evolved into a great dinning experience over the years and has maintained the excellent service provided by the attentive servers.
The new look is appealing and comfortable.
Rick",4
Great. Had a great time. Service was excellent. Food choices were limited. But patio was great.,4
Great service and food.,4
Everything was great. Found the prices a bit too high for the meal we had.,3
"Very enjoyable dining experience!    Great service and delicious meal!

Thank you very much.",4
"The Yonge Street Miller Tavern patio is one of my favourite places to eat. Great ambience, excellent service and I've yet to have a meal that is anything but excellent. I highly recommend.",4
"We were there celebrating our Anniversary last night. Exceptional service, great atmosphere and delicious food made for a memorable evening. Topped off with a complimentary Prosecco made it perfect.",4
"We really enjoyed the outdoor patio. It is beautiful and a lovely surprise. It was covid-careful and not overcrowded even though every table was full. 
My only issue would be the lack of options for Celiac and Allergy-conscious menu choices. Very little to choose from - this will make us hesitate to return. 
A risotto or a gluten free pasta or gluten free quesadilla or taco or gluten free bun for the burger - would be nice.",4
"I went to Miller Tavern for the first time in May and I‚Äôve been back several times since. The food is incredible, the service is outstanding and the atmosphere (especially on the patio) is unlike any other restaurant in Toronto. I typically don‚Äôt leave reviews for restaurants but we had such an amazing experience this evening I knew I had to. Our servers name was Maria and from start to finish she provided 10/10 service. Next time I come back, I‚Äôm definitely going to request to be sat at one of her tables.",4
"Outdoor patio is like being in a garden - rather unique atmosphere
Top notch service. Food very good",3
"service was great!!
the patio is beautiful 
good always consistent",4
"Usually deserts are dissapointing! They don't match the quality of the menu.

Also would be nice to have some bread and olive oil with first drinks..

Thank you",3
Thoroughly enjoyable!!,3
"Very pleasant evening! Food was excellent , staff were engaging. Patio was comfortable and enjoyable.",4
Great evening as usual. Never any disappointments. Love the revamped outdoor patio,4
Great spot!,4
The patio is a true oasis on a hot summer day.,3
"Great food, service is wonderful. The salmon outstanding on the salad. Attentive service and friendly. Willy is a great server, he is the best! Waldorf salad is superb! I‚Äôll be back soon!",4
Birthday dinner,4
very nice patio to have a drink and quick snack prior to dinner,4
"The Miller is an outstanding restaurant; newly redone patio is gorgeous, food superb as always, wait staff are friendly and offer excellent service.  My friends/partner and I always enjoy returning to the Miller.",4
"Went for a birthday dinner. Anna Maria was our sever she was absolutely amazing totally the vibe we wanted so fun but still professional very classy place if you want to have a cute dinner, cocktails and wine. We will definitely be back!",4
Ambiance and service is great .. food a little pricy for what you get,3
"The newly reopened and renovated Miller is a real treat. The patio is gorgeous and the menu is terrific. The staff are also exceptional, especially Anna. She made our evening even better, showing a lovely mix of professionalism, wit and attention.",4
"Server was very good. Appetizer was good (Calamari)...main (Chicken) was good, but not great.",4
"It was a great experience, James was a knowledgeable and friendly server wing a great sense of humour.",4
"Food arrived 1.5 hrs after we placed our order. My business clients noted this several times during the wait. One was a new customer.
Shocked at the overdone, dripping in grease oiled steak. Could not eat it. Would not give it to my dog.",1
Service and food was excellent. Will certainly return,4
"A lovely meeting place, with multiple level patios, surrounded by trees and gardens. Very pleasant and attentive staff. Excellent food. Highly recommended.",4
Food has really improved since I was last there and service was great.,4
Birthday dinner,4
Fantastic patio. Feels like you've left the city!!,4
Waiter sucked,2
Impressive safety protocols and beautiful spacious patio. On-site parking was a huge plus. Food was good and well priced for the quality and ambience.,4
Food and Service was great!,4
The patio was lovely. Food and service were good as well. The menu selection was somewhat limited.,4
Great patio and delicious,4
"The patio at the Miller is just lovely. Our server was great - just the right amount of attention - very personable  and efficient. Miller Caesars are the best!
In the evenings...as the daylight dims and the lanterns light...you realize that you don't want to leave just yet...time for dessert and more good conversation. 
Will definitely go back again!",4
"The food, ambiance and staff are all fantastic. Definitely will come back.",3
"Awesome service and food and atmosphere! 
Loved the attention to every detail to making it amazing dinner with friends! 
Wait staff were friendly and professional!",4
"Patio was great, but could use some mosquito repellent. We were bitten multiple times and it was a distraction from an otherwise great evening.",3
"Waitress were too disturbing, they were too frequently attending the guest which was not necessary, even communication was not good.",4
"Some items in the menu don't have prices, I understand that we don't live close to the sea but they know, if they have lobster or not, and the market price doesn't fluctuate that much, to think that the price is an uncertainty, that might be the case back in the 80's. 
Service is impeccable, food is good a bit expensive but ok to dine outside, some noise from the street but not bad, interior space does require renovation to be in the price range that they are aiming. classic menu and classic dishes, old school, really true to itself.
Sea food tower, perfect for two people as appetizer, escargot is good with an interesting twist.
Tuna tartare spectacular.",3
Better food than in past,4
We enjoy our Miller visits. This time we were seated by the check in area which was bit busy and our umbrella really didn‚Äôt keep sun off so it was very hot. Our stupidity we should have asked to move. Had mentioned it was a birthday and normally a glass of bubbly offered but that was ok. Food great and always a wonderful time despite the heat.,3
Great spot and great patio. Will definitely bring clients here again,3
"Our server was just  excellent, he was very proactive, made great suggestions. He had a nice balanced sense of humor and was fun to deal with.",4
What a surprise for us.  The Miller seems to have been on Yonge forever,4
"The downstairs garden patio was heavenly.  Noise was kept to a minimum.
Food was ample and delicious.  The atmosphere was much better than the upstairs covered patio which was very noisy when we went a couple of weeks ago.",3
"This was the first time I had returned to a restaurant since the first lockdown and I am glad I came here! I've always had fond memories of Miller Tavern, the sunday brunches with my colleagues, celebratory dinner with friends, or just a romantic one on one with my husband. It is just such a versatile restaurant with a wide menu selection so it did not disappoint! Tables were physically spaced well so you do not feel claustrophobic. I almost ordered the entire dinner menu but held myself back so I have a reason to come back. I am definitely coming back again. I just needed to be reminded why I love this place so much!",4
Enjoyed the ambience‚Ä¶.didn‚Äôt order the right food‚Ä¶. Will do so next time,3
"Caesar salad, mushroom croquettes, aperol spritz and sticky toffee pudding were excellent. Burgers were very good, fries not so much.
Our server was awesome!",4
"Excellent North York location with wonderful updated patio nestled near a park.  Delicious food however selection a little limited. Fantastic friendly service.  Will be returning before the fall sets in.

Highly recommend as a great option in NY",4
Myself and my family had a wonderful experience.  We look forward to going back again.,4
Fantastic service. Love the new menu. New pastry chef is incredible as well. Congrats!,4
Lovely server who gave us lots of time to chat. Good view and ambiance.,3
Excellent food and pleasant ambiance. Highly recommend to friends.,4
"Was great just phenomenal.  Food was awesome and the service was great.  Friendly staff, great ambience.",4
Soooo good! Highly recommend the lobster roll sandwich!,4
It was good!,3
Good classy place for dinner . Highly recommended,4
Beautiful patio! Great service,4
"Outstanding meal enhanced by Anna's superb service.  Attentive, professional and spot on recommendations.  Seabream, Calamari and Pasta were delicious.",4
"Love the outdoor patio  at happy hour. Last summer I went several times and enjoyed happy hour wings, burgers. Happy hour menu this summer is limited in choices and not at all to my liking. The Keg has a much nicer choice during their cocktail hours. I hope the Miller will make some changes in this regard. Thanks",2
This is an iconic go to place in my neighbourhood. The patio is always great when the weather co-operates. The oysters were a real treat - so fresh and absolutely fantastic. Always a reliable menu and great service.,4
A great spot to meet with friends but it was a little pricier that we remember,3
Great setting. Sat on the veranda overlooking the parking lot and park. Great air flow noting we‚Äôre just getting back to normal and not used to being inside. The food was terrific and the service was just right.,4
Fabulous food. Great service. I‚Äôll go back frequently.,4
This was our first night out since having  our first child. Anna our server was incredible and also so friendly. The food was fantastic and the patio was beautiful. We felt safe the whole time based on the layout and safety measures taken by the restaurant. We had two apps and two mains which my wife and I split and it was the perfect t amount of food. Thanks k you for the night and for the friendly service Anna!,4
"As always, dining at the Miller was a lovely experience.  The patio is gorgeous, waiters are knowledgeable and friendly and the food is spectacular.  I had the lobster roll and my friend had the fish and chips all devoured with a lovely bottle of pinot grigio--delightful.  It was a bonus to have John serve us again and I'm already looking forward to coming back very soon; reservations made.  Many thanks.",4
"Waiter was friendly, food was delicious and outdoor setting was amazing!  Will definitely be going back again soon!",4
"The renewed patio is absolutely beautiful. The service was excellent  and the food was perfect. The prices are a bit high, but after COVID restrictions, they need to make a living. I want this restaurant to survive, so it is money well spent. Definitely going back soon.",4
"Amazing! Great food , staff and ambiance.",4
"I ordered a Rose wine I had before and I was brought something different without an explanation. When the glass of wine was delivered, I tried it noticing that that was not what I ordered.  I inquired the waitress, I was told Miller didn‚Äôt have the one I requested. Why I was not told that right the way? I kept the glass as a courtesy, but I disliked  the handling of the situation.",3
"Very nice place. Love the patio,so cozy.",4
"Our waiter was knowledgeable, efficient and charming. 
All the wait staff were friendly and helpful.
You make a great Caesar!",4
"Great patio, good food.",4
"With the threat of rain we were moved slightly indoors even though we booked 3 weeks earlier and others were outside under shelter.
When we booked we checked off it was our anniversary and that we had our reception at the Miller 17 years ago.  Apparently all for not as the wait staff had no idea.  We go to the Miller every year on our anniversary.
The waitress was amazing and we had an enjoyable evening but the Miller did drop the ball by not acknowledging the significance of our reservation....why ask if you're not going to use the information to make our visit a little more special.",3
"We were a group of friends who who hadn't seen each other since COVID began, and we may have slightly overstayed our welcome in retrospect -- but at no point did we feel rushed, our server was so kind and patient.  The food and drinks were all amazing, the patio here is lovely, even in the rain -- very enjoyable experience.  We plan to return.  :)",4
Great vibe for a saturday afternoon lunch with family. The open patio allowed us to stay dry while enjoying the weather!,3
"Great food! Ordered the seafood platter as a starter, all the seafood was fresh and firm, even the lobster from PEI and the shrimp from Vietnam! It was market price but worth it!",4
Great patio‚Ä¶just beautiful. And great service. But the amount of food you get for the price is crazy. Super small portions. Definitely not worth what you‚Äôre paying for.,3
"Although getting into the parking lot was a little problematic due to construction, parking was adequate. The four of us were warmly welcomed. Our waiter, Demetri was delightful as usual.  Supper was delicious. Three of us had Wagyu burgers with fries and  one had the fish and chips. This was our second visit to the Miller Tavern since we entered phase 3.  Proper safety precautions were taken and we felt very comfortable eating on the patio.",4
"A little bit noisy with road construction on Yonge Street in the area where we sat. Be sure to avoid the upper corner area near the bar as a result, staying closer to the bottom or parking-side of the restaurant.  The upstairs indoor dining area has been opened up to look like an exotic Miami-style beach place with open windows and is just gorgeous, as is the patio in general.  A beautiful place to sit in North Toronto, the best that we know of.
Food is expensive, but wonderful with the best Crabcakes and Mussels we have eaten outside of Cali, Boston, the tuna tartar is very intelligently constructed and extremely fresh. They care a lot about seafood quality here and the oysters are top notch.  The salmon as well was as if fresh from an ocean-going vessel, ridiculously good.  Best for last, server Maria makes it a joy altogether.",3
"Carley is amazing ! Great service, very attentive and helpful!",4
"We loved the outdoor space. It was pretty, comfortable and appropriately socially distanced. The food was amazing!!! We had the seafood platter and dessert of the day. Will definitely be back.",4
It‚Äôs always a lovely experience at the Miller Tavern.  The staff is wonderful and goes above and beyond to provide great service and to make guests feel welcome and looked after.,4
Great business meeting love this place,4
The reservation process was excellent and expedient.  Staff was very attentive and efficient.,4
"Many levels to the patio seating which is inviting and comfortable. 
Good service.",3
I always enjoy eating at the Miller.  I am so glad the restaurants are open again.,4
This was such a lovely place to meet a friend for dinner.  The staff were amazing and took care to ensure safely.  The outdoor seating was well spaced and very comfortable.  I'll surely be back!,3
"Thought the menu has limited options, what  they have is excellent.  I had the roast chicken. Delicious! Maria our server was pleasant and attentive.",4
Had fillet and strip loin. Perfectly cooked. Waiter was very attentive and we had a wonderful evening as always,4
"The patio and service was amazing! Food was great too, just big portioned.",4
"One of the best filets ever 
Patio was lovely 
Would definitely recommend it",3
"Amazing server, very helpful and went out of his way to ensure we were satisfied",4
"Our greeter was so unclear about our dining in vs out option.  It took us 15 mins to get seated.  They gave us a hard stop for 7 pm but we didn't get dessert till 6:49 pm.  Order was placed at 6:30 pm.  

Our server was great.  

Food was good but my dessert was disappointing.  Lemon tart was extremely tart! 

I have had way better experiences here; last night was mediocre.",2
Service was good. Quiet which was nice. Happy Hour prices for wine and food was great.,3
Good to see some of the previous staff back and the menu including many of the old favourites.  sadly missing are Dim Sun and curry,3
Steak prices were very high,4
Good food. Lovely attentive service.,4
Reserved a table in advance on the patio. Server was excellent. I have issues with dairy intolerance. He went out of his way to make sure I was able to get my choice of food with no dairy. The lunch menu is spectacular. Beautiful patio. Selection of teas available not that great but overall- can‚Äôt complain.,4
Lovely place beautiful ambiance. Lovely setting and environment. Food was very nice and well presented will definitely visit again.,4
"Service was excellent.  

Food was expensive and poor quality - calamari were soggy, breading falling off.  The mussels although tasty because of the type but the broth had too much Dijon which overpowered the rest of the fresh ingredients. 

 We were all quite disappointed.  We have been here many times prior to Covid and the food was always excellent‚Ä¶.",2
Exceptional food. Patio is Llttle noisy due to noise from cars passing by ( its near yongr street),4
"Patio was beautiful, great ambiance and atmosphere.  Food was delicious.  Not too impressed with my Sake martini but otherwise enjoyed everything and service was friendly.",4
Everything was very good especially the physical setup and the ambiance. Main complaint was the main course selection was quite limited in view of the high prices.,3
Fantastic waiter. Super professional quick friendly and thoughtful. Brought a little cake for a friends bday celebration,4
Our local favourite. Very refreshed ambiance after recent patio renovations. We'll back again soon.,4
"Lovely outdoor location, with tables placed strategically so well-distanced. My friend ordered the roast beef sandwich, which he said was tasty. I had the Greek salad which came with too much cheese, tasteless tomatoes, no lettuce, and no olives. Don't order it. It's expensive for what you get.  No bread offered.

The server was very nice and attentive. 

I think you pay for the location. Make sure you have a reservation. I had to park at paid parking as the Miller's lot was full, but that is unusual. 

Overall a B.",2
"This is a go-to for taking clients for a business lunch. My most recent trip (7/15/21) was great! There were awesome recommendations from our server (Sea Bream fillet and paired wine) - both spectacular. My guests went with the fish and chips, which you cannot go wrong (both guests are from the east coast, so very particular about F&C, they loved it). Dessert was a tasty lemon meringue tart with capaccino! I love this place and will be back soon :)",4
"My first ‚Äòoutside of my home‚Äô dining experience since the pandemic began - the new patio designs, attentive service and lovely surprise ‚Äòon the house‚Äô to help celebrate a colleague‚Äôs retirement was a first rate way to also celebrate ‚Äòreopening‚Äô! Great experience all around!",4
The appetizers were of very poor quality. I recommend that the managers/chefs rethink the recipes and appetizer selection to ensure that everything is fresh and homemade.,2
Bday lunch.,3
"Amazing food, I loved my seafood platter. The service was also great and patio setting is lovely",4
We had Maria as our server and she was amazing! Thank you for a great evening.,4
Simply perfect,4
Great service from Sam!,2
We had the beef dip. It was the best I have ever had. It was pricey but delicious.,3
We were there for my birthday. They treated us to champagne and dessert. The server was very friendly and efficient. The food was very good and arrived in a timely manner.,3
The Miller Tavern has a wonderful three tiered patio with great service and excellent food.    They have just redecorated and the new chairs are wonderfully comfortable and the new lights on the patio make it feel like a fairyland.  I do love going here.  If I had any constructive criticism at all it would be to enlarge the menu.,4
The staff do a great job even when expecting rain.,3
We had the most lovely lunch experience today.  Beautiful patio offered outdoor dining protected from the elements.  Food and service were excellent.  Highly recommend he lobster rolls.  Will return.,4
Lovely lunch with my mom on the veranda,4
"The food was absolutely delicious and the ambiance at the patio was perfect.  Our server, Dimitri, was very friendly and it was a lovely experience!  We will be back soon.",4
In this era of patio dining the Miller Tavern is among the best. Recent upgrades and renovations has made the patio very inviting and the service and food were very good.,4
Thank you so much for making our friends birthday so memorable,4
Enjoyed a lovely meal (lobster tails - yum!) - served by a delightful waiter who made our anniversary dinner that much more special - on your gorgeous new patio.  Thank you for making the evening so special.,4
Patrons should have been told when making the reservation that contact tracing was mandatory.,3
"Most enjoyable. Will return.
Great service. Good ambience and eclectic menu.
Your review box should not require a minimum of fifty characters would not respond again given that criteria.",4
Great food. Great service. Great ambience. We will definitely be going back.,4
"A lovely environment to enjoy a meal at.  Beautifully reappointed, very comfortable seating, ambiance +++, excellent service and delicious food--what more can one ask for?  We've eaten at the Miller many times and will continue to come back whenever we can.",4
Service and meal was great. Missing a kids menu which would be a big improvement given many families dine there.,3
After a short uncertainty about the check in process we were seated at a lovely patio table surrounded by greenery. The service was impeccable and the food delicious. We were not rushed but we didn‚Äôt have to wait either for the service. All around an enjoyable experience. A bit of Yonge Street noise but quite well muffled by the landscaping.,4
"Excellent experience with a delicious menu and a wide selection of drinks, deserts and appetizers",3
"The menu is wonderful, excellent food and the staff outstanding!
The Miller is superb!",4
Wonderful service!,4
Overall a good experience.  The menu is very limited. The security check in was time consuming,4
Went with two very young kids and the staff was so kind and treated us so well. Thank you for a lovely experience,4
"We came for Happy Hour to the patio - half price appetizers and some drinks too. Second time for me. First time for her to the renovated version. We had appetizers - they were so delicious - we had three: mushroom croquettes, cod cake and tomato galette. All were great, but the galette is out of this world!. we re-ordered it! Our wait person was friendly and the staff was welcoming and ready to help in  any way. 
Lovely place to spend a summer afternoon.",4
The Miller Tavern is my husband and myself's favorite neighbourhood restaurant. We are so happy that the restaurants are opening again and look forward to spending more good times at the Miller.,4
Perfect. I would return here definitely the food and the service was perfect went in the middle of the day and everything we had tasted fantastic they have good protocols in place and I‚Äôm looking forward to when I can eat inside.,4
"We had lunch on the patio and it was very enjoyable. Gracious and helpful staff and a wide variety on the menu for all tastes. 
But the pricing is ridiculous. We wanted to share a shrimp cocktail that comes with 3 shrimp, we decided to add and extra shrimp and it was $12.00. We each had a salad, shared the shrimp cocktail, 1 glass of wine and 1 coffee and lunch was $82.00 including tip and tax per person.  That is a bit over the top as far as I'm concerned. I'm not saying I won't go back but they really need to adjust their pricing a bit.",3
The food was delicious.  Our server went out of her way to look after us.,3
The best patio in the city as it feels like you are at a cottage. Exceptional food and fantastic service. It's good to be able to go out again.,4
"The patio is delightful and service was excellent, from check in to departure at the restaurant. We both had fish (salmon and Sea Brease) and they were excellent, as was the crab cake. I felt they were going out of their way to welcome us all back.",4
"Prompt, friendly and courteous service, great menu & a good wine selection.",4
The  new patio is beautiful. Great even if it‚Äôs raining. The food was delicious. The service was beyond expectation.,4
"Enjoyed being able to dine out. 
Great service!
Outstanding food",4
The restaurant was amazing. The staff was nice and friendly. The food was incredible. As well the service was quick and fast. Yet we did not feel rushed at all. Overall great experience.,4
"Fantastic! Maria was delightful, and the seafood is top notch-- we have been up and down the East Coast down to the Carolinas and the crab cakes and fish and chips are some of the best we ever ate -- I am serious!",4
"Not only the restaurant is situated in a quite area where you get to appreciate the nature, but also it is so beautifully decorated. 

The service was so outstanding that I would give 12 starts out of 5 if I could! 
We felt vert welcomed and well-treated the whole time. 

The food was also great, especially their Mushroom Croquettes! 

If someone‚Äôs looking for somewhere to eat where both service and food are great, I would recommend this place!",4
Wonderful dinner - very expensive since the reopen.,3
"We had a neutral/could be better experience once at Miller Tavern but we recently went back and it was definitely nothing short of phenomenal. Amazing servers who know the food well, very attentive, the little patio has a very nice vibe, and felt upscale. The lobster tail was a special and it was delicious! The truffled Mac and Cheese is a nice take on comfort food. The chicken was also perfectly seasoned, not dry, and a good choice for my friend who is a picky eater.",4
"Probably the best patio I've gone to so far. It's extremely beautiful and they have lots of room. Please don't forget about the extensive drink menu that includes cocktails, martinis, and don't even get me started on the wine menu. I tried the waygu beef burger for the first time and now I'm hooked. I went for lunch but I cannot wait to come back for dinner.",4
"Amazing patio,comfortable and COVID friendly. Food was great and Wiily is amazing.",4
"Just super basic food, not a lot of options, wasnt cooked very well, and especially for the prices you're paying. Overall a disappointing experience.",1
Extremely pretty garden area.  Some is covered to protect if it rains.  Can be family dinner.,3
Just there for afternoon drinks! Was great as always,4
"Food and waitresses were very good! Overall atmosphere was pleasant.

The host Pamela, was not as welcoming. I have requested to be seated under a shade, and when I mentioned this to the host, she stated ‚Äúit‚Äôs not going to be raining, we have been monitoring this‚Äù. She didn‚Äôt even listen to our request and had an assumption that this is why we have requested for it. There were many seats available with a rooftop, and we have noted that there were many who came after who didn‚Äôt have a reservation, get accommodated to their request under a shade. We noted this as we were seated right next to the hostess.",2
Kenny was a VERY attentive waiter. Made the evening even better,4
Great experience overall. Great food and service - nice to be back out on a patio for lunch.,4
This has been by far one of the best Patios we have been to since Covid. Service was exceptional. The bartender was a joy and really knew what his drinks. The patio was covered and cool nd the food was so delicious. I would definitely return here.,4
"food, ambience and service were excellent! surprised by some of the prices, such as for steak!!",3
"A great lunchtime patio. Friendly and knowledgeable service with easy free parking,",4

Lovely patio, excellent service and delicious seafood dinners.  

Recommended",3
My fave patio to go to! Impeccable service and food. I always leave happy !,4
"Celebrated our anniversary here and the experience was fantastic.  It was a perfect night, from the service, to the food, to the ambiance.  It was our first time dining here and we will definitely go back!",4
"Waiter was professional, attentive, and very personable. Patio was attractively decorated. Spacing between tables was great and you did not feel uncomfortable. I had Raspberry Point oysters and the salmon. My friend had the ahi tuna and the sea bream. We were both thoroughly pleased with our choices.",3
Fantastic patio and the food was amazing.,3
"Dined here for the first time and on the patio. Great location and beautiful atmosphere. 
Menu is done through your phones but this wasn't explained to us when we were seated and my husband and I both put our phones away to enjoy our time together without being distracted  by messages and notifications... We waited a good 30 mins for then menus before asking a waiter for food & drinks menus before being told you can access the menu via the QR code which he handed us. There needs to be something on the tables explaining this.",3
Patio is awesome! A little get away on the city. Chilled Corn soup was delicious!,4
Amazing service and food. Patio is beautiful. Highly recommend.,4
"Great patio, bit noisy by the street. Good value esp. during Happy hour otherwise pricy.",3
Creative chef. Stunning cold corn soup; lovely sea bream; elegant fish and chips.,4
"Great and tasty food 
Sea stream was amazing and same with the lemon pie 
Delicious",4
The staff is excellent and professional.  Their patio is beautiful with comfortable seating.,4
Great patio and great service. Def going to be back!,4
I love everything about the Miller patio and the service is excellent. The food is good but overpriced for what it is. The ambiance all makes up for it because it‚Äôs the experience is what it is mainly about for us.,4
Told when I got there I had to leave after 90 minutes which I was not happy about. It turned out they were not very busy so enjoyed the evening with my clients.,3
Great service in a beautiful patio setting.  Would recommend!,4
"I have been going to The Miller, since Rob opened it a few years ago, and have seen many changes in all aspects of the operation.
While the furniture is very nice and in keeping with the times, the food service has improved by a good margin, the food was OK, however it was what I would have expected in a regular Pub like entity. The price for the food was outlandish, yes, I do understand costs, as I was brought up in the Hospitality industry in three countries, I feel I can judge value. 
The prices do not reflect the true value at all, when I get and add on of a few bits of Chicken on a salad and have to pay $7.00 for that, to me that is out of line. 
Yes, you must get a return on your investment, but to me, as a past regular customer, you have priced a whole sector of people out of your intended market.",1
"Tip should start at 18% altho we now always give 20%
Did not like being told JUST as we sat down that we had only 90 minutes.
A little soft note on the table would be friendlier ie Due to‚Ä¶., we would appreciate‚Ä¶‚Ä¶",3
"Great out door patio.
Book prior to reserve a seat",4
Our waiter was so great! He was always ready to help but not at all intrusive.,4
It was absolutely amazing dinner?,3
"A fabulous server, best lobster rolls north of N.S. and perfect location on lower patio which I had requested.  The Miller never disappoints.",4
"I was disappointed in my meal and did not eat half of it. 
I asked for a roll and butter. 
I was told there‚Äôs a charge of $2.50. 
I was brought 2 thin pieces of dry toast. 
I spoke with the manager about that. 
He apologized that it was not a roll. He removed the charge. 

If this restaurant does not have FRESH bread, they should not be serving dry toast‚Ä¶. at a charge. 

I had to find the manager to ask about the bread/roll. 
I was told it was Ace Bakery sourdough bread. 
Nevertheless it was cut very thin and toasted. So obviously not fresh. 

I don‚Äôt mind paying higher prices. But I expect quality. Regrettably I didn‚Äôt experience that at the Miller Tavern.",2
"Food was fantastic.  William, our server was excellent.  Great spot! Great night",4
"This place is a little oasis - located uptown, the Miller Tavern is perfect ambiance for a casual mid-week dinner or a special occasion. The food is delicious, the patio is super cute and the service was beyond stellar. Our server Kenny was gracious, knowledgeable and always on point with his recommendations and stories - really upped our experience!! Escargot is a must-try and the Tavern burger was one of the best I‚Äôve had! Thank you to the entire staff at Miller Tavern for the warm welcome and beautiful experience - we missed this place!!",4
great patio!!! great food and service will return,4
"The 2 cocktails we ordered were watered down, and they were pricey! Food was good but way too pricey for what they gave us. 

Lovely staff and patio - but for those prices , food and drinks should be better.",2
Renowned. Great dining experience.  Spacious. Great Covid protocols.,4
"Make a reservation before you go.
It was empty when we arrived at 3:45 - for the half priced happy hour appetizers 3-5 - and we were told we could stay for 45 minutes.  We checked open table and made ourselves a reservation for 4pm and we were moved to the patio and had plenty of time to order, eat and chat.
If you go for happy hour it's a good value, the hot appetizers are the ones that are on for half price.  They were all delicious.",3
"patio got noticeably better, food was good and service very friendly. The new ""clean"" standards are working for many establishments, customers appreciate that",3
Birthday.  Very covid conscience. Great food. Excellent service.  Great first patio experience!,4
Nice patio. Perfect place to end Covid restrictions!,3
"Was there for lunch, awesome service, great patio and good food!",4
"Beautiful patio, great food with friendly professional service.  I would highly recommend the experience.",3
"Their patio is better than ever. The food, on the other hand, is only getting worse.",2
"Very nice patio and great service. Unfortunate they ran out of certain menu selections.
Cocktails can be improved",3
"The environment is very nice.  The food is delicious, kids friendly.  The waitress is super nice.  We would recommend Miller Tavern to a friend and we will definitely be frequent guests there.",4
We had a wonderful Father‚Äôs Day dinner at the Miller. The patio setting is beautiful with the string lights. Comfortable seating. Service was attentive. We had steak with sides ( truffle Mac and cheese and saut√©ed mushrooms) - delicious. The moules frites was perfect - mussels were cooked to perfection. My young children ate very well and there was enough on the menu to find something they would eat. The team there accommodated my family of 5 and we felt safe and appropriately distanced from other tables. Thank you Miller Tavern!,4
"Miller Tavern never disappoints.  Great menu, one of my favourite patios, and our server Kenny was outstanding.",4
"We are old customers of The Miller. So glad that you open again with the dazzling new renovations. LOVE THEM! 

I have to inquire, where is the gorgeous shell sculpture? We didn‚Äôt see it in the garden. It gives such a special look. Please bring it back.",4
Great ambience and service. Drinks amazing food above average. Good choice for a relaxed drinks evening.,4
"Amazing food, large outdoor patio",4
"Always a great time at Miller Tavern. The food is the main reason we dine here but with Covid and limited outdoor patio seating, I was impressed with how normal things felt. The Covid checks were done seamlessly prior to check in, the patio ambiance was super cute and cozy, the tables were distanced nicely apart, the staff was super courteous, timely and pleasant (despite having to wear masks all day - working with a smile). We were happy to be back and cannot wait until our next visit.",4
"To celebrate my husband‚Äôs ‚Äúgraduation‚Äù online courses due to Covid. First 2021 patio , Miller Tavern doesn‚Äôt disappoint.",4
"Lovely patio, prompt courteous service, they were kind enough to heat up my baby's food for me as well. The food was good as always, although my lobster roll was a little over-toasted. My husband's beef dip was delicious.",4
"Terrific service and very good food. Enormous portions, we couldn‚Äôt finish and regretfully declined their offer of packing up the remnants. I had the fish and chips, and my daughter had the rigatoni alla vodka. She also requested a Shirley Temple which they kindly created fir her.",4
Steak over cooked,2
"This is the second time in a week that I have had lunch on Miller‚Äôs patio.  It  is the perfect place - good food, attentive service, and attractive setting.",4
"The atmosphere was beautiful! The server Monica , a wonderful asset to the establishment. Knowledgeable and helpful. I will be back again!üëçüèΩüëèüèΩ",4
"Beautiful patio, can be bit noisy close to street.",3
Food is very good and the service is excellent. Large patio for outdoor dining,4
"The Miller patio is an oasis. The service is friendly and efficient. My only complaint is the lobster roll which I ordered. Though a decent meal, I thought the amount of lobster was skimpy given the $29 cost.",3
Its a very nice place but I always find it very over priced.  I would go more often but it is too expensive.  $32.00 for fish n chips.  My freinds feel the same way.  Its too bad. The price keeps us away.  There are many other venues to choose from.,2
I loved the covered patio section because it provided some shade and was so very comfortable.  I would definitely return to try other items on the menu but the French Fries were absolutely amazing and so was the Waygu Burger!,4
"A patio that is outstanding. Even more beautiful than last year. Love the service, food and atmosphere. Second visit already and perfect.‚≠êÔ∏è",4
"Beautiful patio, cozy atmosphere, highly recommend!",4
"The patio is beautiful and peaceful. True park like setting. The food was creative and very tasteful. Our server, Carly was fabulous and very knowledgeable. We tried the lobster rolls both way and very good. We will be back!!!",4
"Friendly waiter and good food. Good to be out, finally.",3
It was very lovely place ‚Ä¶ I really liked the food presentation and atmosphere.,4
Great being back at the Miller again! Beautiful updated patio with good coverage for rain and lots of space. Love this neighborhood restaurant!,4
"Some menu items were not available, nice setting and sheltered from the rain. Service and friendliness of the staff were good. Prices are extremely high given the quality and nature of the food. It‚Äôs easy to get comparable fish and chips for half the price.",1
It was great to be back.The patio is well set up. Eating under the covering with the rain coming down was extra ambiance. The staff did a great job handling the rain.,3
I have been many times to the Miller tavern before with never being disappointed. First time coming back,3
They have rebuilt the patio area and it is gorgeous. Well-covered even during a downpour. The service was friendly and prompt. The food was excellent (we sampled 4 different appetizers plus a lobster roll). All was fresh and delicious. We‚Äôll be back!,4
food was not very good and the menu variety was weak. Considering they just reopened - the service was slow and unenthusiastic (the restaurant was not busy).,1
Arriving at the patio entrance noticed straight away The Miller Tavern had installed all new tables & chairs along with overhead lights. The patio area looked so lovely. The chairs were comfortable. Tables well spaced apart. The three of us all enjoyed out meal. All the wait staff were so accommodating. They helped to make it a wonderful evening.,4
We had a great evening ! The patio is perfect. Food was amazing and service was exceptional,4
Our server John was outstanding!!,4
Good service and food.  However a few menu items not available  overall very nice.,3
"Everything was good however, portions are too small and pricey.",3
"Great food & service! Really nice patio, very private and they did a great job at making sure there was enough room between tables for social distancing.",4
"The outdoor patio is lovely, food was very good and our server was a really nice women.   Always a great experience in my opinion.",4
Friendly staff and nice ambiance. Our family enjoyed the food.,4
Beautiful patio. It was so nice to be out with friends. We all enjoyed our food and service was great!,4
What an amazing patio! Great service and food.,4
First time in this restaurant and I had an amazing experience. Good food and outstanding service. Recommend it!,4
Patio extremely pleasant. Staff very helpful and friendly Not to intrusive,4
Please redo the survey and in particular the question regard dining with members of one household. Friends can eat together once all vaccinated.,2
"Came for a late lunch/early dinner meal. Wasn‚Äôt overly busy, so the food came fast, tasted amazing. The ambiance was beautiful as they have made some great additions and changes to their patio, all new furniture and overhead lights. My girlfriend and I had a wonderful overall experience for our first date back after Covid Restrictions lifted. John Q was a great server and I can‚Äôt wait to go back again!",4
"Considering it was their first day open, the service, food, and ambiance were excellent.
The patio is lovely and beautifully landscaped.  Try to get a table on a lower level, away from the noise of Yonge Street.  I‚Äôm going again this coming week.",4
Polite. Attentive staff. Great patio,3
Great food and great service.  Super location with parking,4
This is one of our favourite restaurants.  Dishes are good.  Impeccable service.  Good atmosphere and nice patio.  They adhere to the guidelines as handed down from the government regarding the safety of the customers and the staffs during this critical time of the pandemic.  Highly recommended.,4
"We came for Sunday birthday breakfast. Breakfast was not offered. Only lunch menu was offered. Sunday was a very cold, rainy day. Patio windows were open as per Covid protocol. It was freezing. We were sitting in our coats and scarfs and were still cold. It was my mistake because I did not enquire if breakfast is going to be served.",0
"Felt safe as they have good COVID protocols in place.

Service was fantastic - friendly, helpful and attentive.  Food was awesome!",4
A very nice evening out. Service was professional and friendly. Food was delicious. Good wine and beer selection.,4
Great patio setup for rainy or cold weather. Loved it.,4
"Great service, delicious food - try the truffle lasagna.",4
"Miller Tavern is wonderful with its outdoor Patio (perfect for Covid outdoor dining safely with your household). I love the fresh air and large, sliding glass door/windows which gives a view of tree tops, feels like a park. Food is excellent, my favourites are burgers and salads and tofu lettuce wrap as appetizer. Cheers",4
Wings and tofu dish were good. We sat in the terrace. We were spaced far enough apart to make it private.,4
"Great food - awesome staff.
A great last night prior to lockdown.",4
It was accommodating considering it being outdoors. Lots of heaters helped.  Food was good.,4
"A wonderful spot even in these horrifying times.  Great food, good value, friendly, knowledgeable waiters who did their utmost to make the experience enjoyable.  We can hardly wait to get back as soon as the 28 days lockup is over.  Hang in there, Miller owners and staff--we will get through this.

Jane",4
"As always, the Miller was excellent.  In these dreadfully trying times, it give me joy to be able to eat at a patio restaurant that takes such amazing care to follow all of the rules.  The staff are very knowledgeable, pleasant and friendly and do their utmost to make one feel warm and comfortable even on cool days. Miller's vast menu offers many wonderful choices and the food is delicious.  Thank you.",4
Despite the cool evening. The staff did everything to make it a lovely experience.,4
"Great place to grab a drink and Snack on a crisp day!
Heaters and fire pits help.",4
"Delightful service and good food with a quiet, safe venue",3
A great place to go for drinks and food. Staff are very accommodating. Layout is safe.,4
"The service was friendly and efficient and eating outdoors was pleasant. That said, the food was mediocre and expensive.",1
"Some menu items we were looking forward to having again were not available, e.g. fish and chips, a big disappointment.  The service was friendly but slow and it was sometimes difficult to get the attention of staff.  The food quality was very good.",2
"Tasty food, good portions, good value, great menu, awesome service.  Ambiance is okay- patio only at this time. No real effort to make area or tables inviting. Many things on the menu weren't available - two fish dishes, one appie, one soup.  I pre-ordered chocolate cake for a birthday dessert and that wasn't available either, which they told me when I arrived. We arranged an alternative. Reason given for shortened menu was busy weekend and supplier orders haven't arrived. Server was excellent- helpful, polite, attentive despite being busy, friendly and upbeat.  Handling of COVID was good.",3
The patio is a gorgeous spot. The food is good except the French fries are a bit disappointing. Happy hour is a fantastic value but I wish they had a few more choices . Have been there a number of times and it is consistently good.,4
Great option for Covid.  Lots of covered areas and heaters,3
My burthday,4
"Always a dependable experience. Never disappoints. Servers accommodating and pleasant. Depending on the time, can be quite noisy and definitely not conducive to quiet t√™te √† t√™te.",3
"SERVICE AND AMBIENCE WERE AMAZING.  FOOD WAS OKAY,  MY KIDS CHICKEN FINGERS WERE WAYYYY TOO SALTY AND SO WERE THE FRIES.  THE TOFU LETTUCE WRAPS HAD VERY LITTLE TOFU AND ALOT OF CABBAGE-WOW A LOT OF THAT. CHICKEN WINGS WERE INCREDIBLE AND BEET SALAAD AND BURGERS WERE ALSO INCREDIBLE!!",3
Waiter was attentive and assisted with ordering. Service was good and responsive,3
Amazing measures put in place to keep social distancing and felt so comfortable. The fries are to die for and the drinks spot on,4
"Thanks to Craig and the staff for an amazing evening. The food was incredible, ambiance was amazing and the patio was perfect with fireplaces and heaters.",4
"It was quite a chilly evening on the patio but the heaters were great, especially once some other guests left and the staff moved them even closer :)
The handmade kettle chips were delicious and had to order more. The roasted chicken was amazing and beautifully plated. The pasta was also very good. Staff were extremely attentive especially in ensuring we were comfortable.",4
"It's Friday night.  COVID means we are eating out.. literaƒ∫ly outside in a tent, under the glow of strings of lights and propane heaters.  Service was warm, it mattered we were here. We eat out for both the food and fun of eating.  Sometimes the food is not the way remember it, or we wish they did fries the old way. But no harsh words today.  Just appreciate the effort.
Bundle up, wear your mask, wash your hands and be grateful.",3
Great food and high standard of service during the difficult COVID situation.,4
"Seating an service were prompt.  The patio was quite cold due to patio glass doors being opened, by which all the diners were seated against.  Portable heaters would've made our stay more enjoyable.",2
Was my Best friends Birthday,2
Staff are wonderful. We waited 15 min for our reservation and the host provided us with glass of prossecco.  This kind of service keeps you going back. WAit staff cheerful and personable.,4
"Host wasn't very personable but otherwise service was great.  Very few appetizers available, but we were there mainly to get out and have a drink on a patio so it served it's purpose.",3
Happy Hour is great value. I wish there was more variety on the appetizers but the wings are fabulous. The outside patio is a lovely setting. It feels like someone‚Äôs backyard and you don‚Äôt hear any noise from Yonge St.,3
Nice and warm on the patio!!! Great place to meet!,4
Always a great place for lunch or dinner. Never disappointed.,4
"They have mastered COVID seating both outdoors on the Patio and indoors in the screened in Verandah.  If you need a place to eat during COVID this is good for social, business or family.",3
Everything was wonderful :),3
"Great to be able to dine on the patio with heaters. Food was good although overpriced. 1 app and 2 modest entrees, 1 drink each, was nearly $120.",3
We had another delicious meal at our favourite neighbourhood restaurant. The tenderloin with truffle Au juice was perfect.,4
"perfect patio weather day - Wednesday, October  14th !
food, ambiance, service - all excellent !",4
Food was good but not worth price. Service was friendly and good but the food took a long time to come to the table. A lot of noise coming from Yonge but understandable you can't do much to avoid.,3
"Great meal as always. 
Since Covid I have been there often. 
You have a great patio!",4
GOOD VENUE - HOPE WE HAVE MORE GOOD WEATHER FOR OUTDOORS,4
Lunch with friends,4
This was the perfect setting for lunch with my Dad on a beautiful fall day. We were given our choice of tables which was a special touch. The service and service were impeccable.,4
"Always a pleasure going to Miller Tavern, very professional service, friendly all the time, food is great, and they make it extra special when it's someone's birthday.  thank you Miller Staff for a perfect job done.",4
"Always great food and great service 
Our favorite place to go when we can. 
It‚Äôs to bad the cr√®me br√ªl√©e they took off the menu. 

It was the only Disappointment",3
"Great patio. Felt absolutely safe. A little noisy, but that was due to traffic on Yonge Street which is out of the restaurant‚Äôs control. Heaters kept us warm and the Fall colours just added to the ambience. Food was terrific. We all enjoyed ourselves!",4
"I love The Miller....Service was fabulous,. We tried almost all the appetizers and they were simply DELICIOUS.... The mains were equally outstanding and the sticky toffee pudding, delightful. Pair this with a fine Pouilly Fuisse  - you have the perfect luncheon!",4
"Waiter was too eager to take our order.  Did not give us a chance to settle.  
Patio was well spaced for SD",3
"My daughter and I really enjoyed our Sunday lunch on the patio. We both had the Chef's daily special, which was a warm stew of tomatos, kale, onions, 3 poached eggs and crumbled feta on top. It was excellent. The service was excellent, and the patio furniture was well spaced out and clean, which we appreciated. I had a nice glass of Chenin Blanc with my lunch which was nicely chilled, and I finished with an excellent Cappucino.",4
"We all had three different meals - all delirious. And great that there are some vegetarian options. Very good selection of beers, etc. Patio is perfect.",3
We had a wonderful server on the very spacious patio. The food was tasty!,4
Wait staff was outstanding. Abided by all COVID 19 precautions and made us feel very safe. Free dessert for my friends birthday.,3
"We always enjoy The Miller. It's our local fav. The staff are so friendly, great vibe. Jodi is an AWESOME bartender.",4
We went to the patio in August  and the server was very aloof. This time the server was very helpful and engaging. The burgers were excellent. All in all a very relaxing time spent on the beautiful outdoor patio.,3
"This restaurant has a lovely 3 layed patio.  This time we were not in such a good spot but our reservation was made late.  The food is very good and the service always excellent.  I like the greek salad a lot,  the tuna tartar, and the steak.  They are careful with the covid protocols so it feels pretty safe.",3
"The food was not good, and the service was not particularly attentive.",2
Fabulous spot for lunch sitting on a beauty patio. Service excellent.,4
"Love coming here for the patio. Wanted my salad the way I wanted it. Server was snarky. First time I experienced that .
But enjoyed it tremendously. Came perfect.",3
"Terrible, terrible service. Waiter couldn‚Äôt tell us what most popular items were but said he could tell us what doesn‚Äôt sell! What would the owner of the Miller think of that? He also was quite rude to me when I thought I would do him a favour and hand him my credit card on the way to the washroom, as he was standing at a table 2 away from me. He told me he was busy and refused to take the card! Left a message for the manager Andrew to discuss this employee and never received a call back, phoned again and left a message for Leann to give to ANdrew and still haven‚Äôt heard from anyone.  Wow, I guess business is booming amd they don‚Äôt need to have good customer service. Go somewhere else where they will treat you with manners.",0
Nice greeter and waitress,4
Overall an enjoyable experience on the patio. However the group was both surprised and disappointed that there were NO out door heating units!,2
Great place for lunch or dinner. service is excellent and not over the top. food is tasty but a bit expensive. 2 hamburgers and an shared appetizer and coffee and tea came out to $95 plus your tax and tip comes to $55 per person. Just a bit much for lunch.,3
Dining on patio was very good.,4
"Disappointed by noise on outdoor patio from landscaping, and the  food (which is generally excellent- for what ever reason that day was not quite as good.) Very slow and disinterested server.

Ordinarily I would give a higher review but this visit disappointed me a bit.",1
Food is amazing and patio and veranda are awesome,4
"Paul made the dinner flow with joy. The oysters, the burger, Cesar salad and tomahawk were outstanding, while chips and fish and chicken fingers were ordinary, yet were eaten to the last piece.  We do regret the changes to the menu that taken away the classics like lobster quesadilla and nacho stash, still Tavern emerged from covid in style, largely based on the great service, quality produce and overall charm. Thank you.",3
"The service staff was amazing.  The options for indoor / patio and outdoor dining allow for social distancing.  As always, comfortable and still remains our favorite family dining.",4
"We barely received any service at all.  Servers were cold, unwelcoming and un-enthusiastic.  They did not even serve any rolls for a $49 steak.  My reservation clearly indicated it was for a birthday celebration.  There was no mentioning or a simple happy birthday greeting throughout our 2 hour meal.",1
Patio lunch and it was very cool.  Otherwise a nice meal,4
"The patio was disappointing as there weren't any heaters - it's all over the news that Toronto patios will have heaters but this one didn't and it was too cold to sit there. We were offered a seat that was inside/outside with sliding glass doors to open. Not the best option during covid. 
Our waiter was friendly enough but focused all of his attention on only person at the table and ignore the others. We had to actually flag him down to ask if we could also have a drink; he delivered a perfect order to his main focused guest but messed up the orders of the other diners. Which he fully admitted was his error.
Overall it was a disappointing experience - food is overpriced and the service of this one waiter was less than optimal. We will not be going back.",2
Was too cold out & we both got sick from the food.,1
"If you‚Äôre going to sit outside, bring your own seat cushions.
I had the halibut, it was sooo delish.
Going back next week, ordering the same lol",4
Server was phenomenal!!!,4
Wait staff outstanding.  Truly. Food is very good!,3
All good  except for noise from Yonge st. our table for 5 was too close!,3
Celebrating a bday. It was wonderful,4
"We asked a received a table on the patio. They have metal seats and metal tables and during Call vid do not have cushions. While a nice evening in September it was cold. They do Donot provide heaters. 

If you select the patio request a lower level table to avoid street noise from Yonge Street.",3
Patio has the perfect ambiance. Felt secluded and did not give the feeling of being in the city. Staff was fantastic.,4
We were seated on the verandah and very well and attentively  treated by the staff. I wish there were better potato options - frites and sweet potato fries.  Have made the request many times!  Also think full dinners should be accompanied by a vegetable - broccoli for example.,4
Food was good but Food service was slow. Took 1/2 hour for food to arrive . The waitress was attentive,2
"Went during happy hour, great value, one of the nicest patios in Toronto",3
"Great food, great service- on patio and Yonge street noise was more than I anticipated- but I could have moved too. I recommend the JM.",3
"Consistent as always. Sat outside and froze, heaters would help, but food was  solid and service was exceptional. A great night all in all .",4
I booked the patio but weather did not co-operate so we sat upstairs in the open window area.  It was great,3
"Due to cool, inclement weather yesterday, we ate inside rather than on the patio.  The food, attentive service, cleanliness, attention to booth/table separation was just as good inside as it has been outside.  We have nothing but good things to say about the Miller and look forward to returning soon.  Keep up the good work.",4
What a wonderful experience! We were celebrating our dad's birthday and Paul and Andrew went really above and beyond to make the experience very special. The food was excellent. The service was fantastic. We had a beautiful table on the veranda as the beautiful 3 tier patio was closed due to rain. We will be back often. I highly recommend going try to sit outside while weather permits.,4
"Had fish and chips.  Fish not bad, chips over salted.",3
"Excellent service 
Very accommodating.
Nice atmosphere.",4
All good I‚Äôm just trying to figure out the ‚Äúnew‚Äùnormal for eating out.,3
Great service.  Wine way too expensive.  Menu good.,3
"Thank heavens no loud music playing and was able to carry  on a conversation without shouting, very unusual these days in a restaurant. Service excellent. Food, average fare, large serving, and ability to sit outdoors on patio  a bonus.",4
Nice ambiance good service good food and drink friendly people,4
The food was delicious. The shrimp cocktail was the best!,4
"Very large multi level patio.  Tables were well space (mote than 2 meters apart).  Staff wore masks, patrons social distanced and wore masks to and from their tables.  We all had burgers and the burgers were excellent.  Service was top notch.  We all had a good time and felt safe.  Very enjoyable lunch - thanks!",4
"We were at the Miller Tavern for lunch. Girls out to lunch:) We had a patio table.
It was nice and cozy.  We were served by a pleasant waitress. The food was good and we were able to talk and socialize without being interrupted.  
It was a very pleasant experience. We all concluded that we were going to come back there in the future. In fact, I immediately booked another lunch date there with another friend for the following week.",3
Great patio but need wasp repellents. Drive us crazy until sun went down.,3
"Unfortunately, our server was not attentive.  He must have been having a bad day.
The noise from the traffic on Yonge Street was sometimes disturbing.
Other than those two issues, the experience was wonderful and we would go again.",3
"My group of four had a great time and a great lunch at The Miller Tavern Patio. I plan to take my family of four there next week. You will like this patio. Good distancing , wait staff  great, and nice ambiance.",4
The patio is spectacular and they completely follow Covid guidelines for safety of their guests.  Going back again,3
"Great food, great service.  We had the same server as last week and she is wonderful.  Steaks were amazing and Wagu burger is the best around.",4
Wonderful Saturday evening spent on the Miller's awesome patio. The couched area gives a nice upscale backyard vibe and a sense of privacy for your meal. The service was great (thanks Kenny!). The food was outstanding as well,4
We had the most amazing experience tonight at the miller. Andrew the manager is on top of everything and Kenny our server was wonderful. The food was delicious and we felt very safe eating on the patio. They take so many precautions to ensure the safety of everyone.,4
"I was provided a nice outdoor table, sheltered from the mid-day sun. The server was very attentive and explained the features on the menu. When the wine that I wanted was not available, she suggested an alternative from the same region in the same price range. Food was excellent. Overall, it was a very nice dining experience and I cannot make a negative comment regarding any aspect of my visit.",4
Great place to meet up with old friends!,4
Beautiful patio and great food. Perfect! I would definitely recommend the Miller.,4
"Pretty good, but not stellar for value. As compared with other patios downtown.",3
Outside patio well spaced and felt comfortable at our table and with our masked server.  On a sunny day this is the place to sit especially as it was our first restaurant luncheon since February.  Easy to get to by car/TTC.  Food and service was very good despite being busy.  We were warmly welcomed.   Would go back.,3
"Great food, service and atmosphere on the outdoor patio.",4
"AMAZING- 5 Star - Our family of 6 with 2 children ages 8 and 11 enjoyed an absolutely AMAZING late midday meal on the lovely patio of the Miller. It was a stellar afternoon... the checkin was delightful- friendly, charming and professional. What a treat when we were escorted to a table and the young staff said ‚Äúwe have a better table, let‚Äôs have a look‚Äù This is outstanding customer service-it is usually left up to us to say, ‚Äúthis table isn‚Äôt quite right or comfortable‚Äù FABULOUS! 
The wait staff also more than Wonderful....
We have dined at the Miller many times and it has always been decent but this was over and above what we have experienced. 
The food, YUM.... I started with the appetizer short ribs- hmmm- mouthwatering followed by the Halibut, moist and delicate enhanced with sweet peas and baby potatoes-DELICIOUS-
The Tavern Burger, OMG, we are going back for this...the fries are the best. Plump, well spiced and not an iota of grease. The best we have ever had! The Cesar salad- delicious, the wings-delicious. We had so many more treats and each dish was a delight. 
Thank you again for a terrific afternoon!",4
"Great location , staff, and food.  Perfect social distancing of patio tables and COVID adherence.",3
We had a great evening. Service was great. Food was tasty and well presented. The patio was beautiful. Great ambiance.,4
"The ambience and peacefulness of the beautiful patio made our first meal out so perfect. 
Thank you!",4
First seating on patio was too close to Yonge St traffic noise so we had to ask twice before we were moved to veranda.  The server could have been more attentive‚Äîclean fork had to be requested for main after using a fork for salad; milk requested for coffee but 18% cream delivered instead.,3
Nice patio,4
Food was just ok.,2
Service was fabtastic. Food was quite good. Only challenge is the traffic noise from the street sometimes but that cannot be avoided. The patio is so well done. I go regularily,3
"Absolutely fabulous, delicious food. Outstanding service. Relaxing, comfortable patio. Among the best restaurants in Toronto!",3
"Miami flat rib app. - excellent!!
Shrimp cocktail - excellent but WAY over priced
Fish & chips - very good 
The service was top notch and the character and ambiance of the outdoor patio was terrific if a little bit noisy. 
No wonder the parking lot fills up quickly.",3
"I've now been to the Miller for lunch and/or dinner at least 6 times.  It a terrific restaurant, polite, friendly, knowledgeable staff who serve very good food with lots of choices.  I'm already looking forward to my next visit and cannot say enough good things about the Miller.",4
"All 3 of our meals were overdone and had to be replaced. 
The street noise from the top floor of the patio was too loud. 
Still a great night out in a super patio.",3
It was good but the menu remains far too expensive for a regular visit.,3
The ambience on the patio is fabulous and so was our server!!!,4
Great staff great food!   Patio ambience is amazing,4
"Small portions, tasteless feta, no real olives, expensive.",2
"Outdoor seating was very comfortable. Service very good. Too much food, (Ordered half a chicken) but took some home with me.",4
The service was courteous and friendly and helpful. The COVID safety measure were very good. And the food was...EXCELLENT!   A very nice way for my husband and I to celebrate our anniversary. Thank you!,4
I love this place. It was relaxed and great outdoor space. Great service and food!,4
Very enjoyable.  Staff were very personable and didn't rush us.,3
"As always, wonderful dinner on your beautiful patio.",4
Food was too expensive and it wasn‚Äôt good at all.,0
"Excellent, friendly service with a spectacular patio but the food was pedestrian at best. Paid upper end prices for food that just was not very good. The highlight of the evening was when the staff had to chase a raccoon off the patio with a broom. We will not be back.",1
Food was not as good as prior to covid.  I found both the bbq chicken and the burger to be salty.,3
My wife and I had a very good experience at the Miller. The service was great our server was a class act. We  will come and enjoy the patio again,4
Beautiful evening for patio dining. Server was excellent. It was very clean and felt safe to dine here with Covid -19 protocols in place.,3
Food was great!  Server was very attentive and polite. Reservation process was simple.,4
Great outdoor patio. Much nicer than inside. Tables well spaced and food was good,3
"Absolutely beautiful patio.  I have been there previously but have sat inside for lunch meetings.  The patio was a pleasant surprise.  Great reccomendations and service by Sabrina.  I miss some of the old dishes and wine list but she was great in guiding me towards dishes that were good and navigated me through the wine list.  There were many measures taken ensure that customers and staff are safe, such as cleaning the machine with sanitizing wipes between uses.  Great experience and exceptional service.",4
Good cocktails.,3
"Nice patio atmosphere - we weren't rushed - Service was friendly, prices reasonable.",4
Enjoyable! Distanced well and lots of space. Nice I had a free piece of pie for my birthday,4
Wonderful neighbourhood dining. Have been many times. Waiter was the best,3
"Initial seating was in blaring sun at a low table totally inappropriate for our guests age.  After waiting an extraordinary time for our waiter to come, we finally were switched to a regular table.  Food was OK but not fabulous and was way too expensive for what amounts to a casual meal.  Service was slow and inattentive, maybe need some post-COVID training?",1
Great at the best of times but really appreciated the spacious patios and generous parking during virus times.,4
"Beautiful 3 tiered patios very private.  Radio way too loud for the blue rinse set that were dining there, turned it down after several complaints.  If they want return customers don‚Äôt blast the music.  The staff can listen to music on their own time.  
They should also think of a lighter menu for lunch and the fact that it‚Äôs summer and people don‚Äôt eat heavy entrees at noon in 30C heat as well as the age group that eat there are older crowd",4
"Great patio!  Wait staff was knowledgable, friendly and accomodating.  Will definitely go to this restaurant again.",3
Very enjoyable atmosphere.  Will definitely return.,4
Lovely outdoor patios. Good food and great service.,4
The patio is nice but unfortunately we were at the only table in pretty much full sun. The food was good but not outstanding. For the prices they charge the food should wow you and it did not.,3
The patio is wonderful. Lots of shady areas. Great service. Little overpriced though.,4
"The service was very friendly and professional, but the food was disappointing.  The steak was overdone and the fish and chips batter was too thick and soggy.  Poor execution on the food overall.",2
"The food was ok, but not great. Prices were somewhat inflated. However, sitting on the patio was good, and our server was attentive",3
The patio was very relaxing and service was great!,3
"Having a Club sandwich on your menu would be nice.
The menu has changed and some of the old items are missing",3
"Fabulous staff everything was great Jackie was our server and she was outstanding .
We will come back .",4
Received a call that the patio was closing due to rain but we were able to get a great table upstairs by the sliding doors. Great server. Good was delicious but due to covid we were only able to get ketchup packets. I‚Äôve been to this restaurant many times. And I will return. Keep up the good work.,3
Had a very pleasant evening.  Excellent food and service.,4
Our server was phenomenal. We appreciated his attention to ensuring a great experience for us. The staff were great in ensuring an outside table was available as requested.,3
"Great food & service, great patio...",4
"First patio I have visited since they have been allowed to be open again- Tables are spaced apart, Servers with masks so I felt very safe.  Food was great and Patio was very nice!",4
"This was my first visit to a patio/public space since the pandemic so I was apprehensive but I was I arrived I was completely at ease with the distancing, not crowded & all the COVID protocols followed throughout the patio & indoors as well. Very pleasant and attentive staff. Kudos to the owners & staff on a great job.",4
"Very good service, great outdoor patio and good food.",3
Patio dining in a nice setting. My wife‚Äôs steak was overcooked but otherwise service was prompt and careful. Social distancing maintained.,3
Everything was good food wise but the fish and chips. More breading than fish,3
"Good beer. Great burger. Very good service, especially the Mexican girl.",3
Had a lovely lunch on the patio. Such a tranquil spot to dine.,3
"We enjoyed the Miller patio as we always did.  Last year, we didn't even notice the music.  The menu scan and the distance dining was done very well.  The wait staff were all very pleasant.",3
"We were venturing out for our first public meal and were very impressed with the manner in which safety and sanitation was handled. As always the patio was lovely. My only complaint is that the fish and chips was overwhelmingly batter, with very little fish. Still, I‚Äôll be back.",3
"Great Patio
Oasis in the city!
Caesar salad perfectly dressed
Nice wine selection
Cozy
Followed covid  guidance",4
"The new menu is very comprehensive yet short with a good mixture of fish, meat and vegan choices. I have been going there on and off for years but I think they have finally produced an Array of delicious tasting foods with distinctive appeals. Highly recommend it. The Outdoor Patio is charming and private. Service is Excellent
Allan Blott",4
"Ate on the patio.  Tables well spaced apart, staff friendly and all wearing masks.",4
"Great Service, food and Beverages
Always an interesting place.",3
the patio is great and we felt very comfortable with the distance between tables,3
"Great patio...lots of seating.
Grilled salmon was very good as was the Malbec.",4
"Great staff, food, ambiance, parking, etc.  Three patios give everyone lots of room and large umbrellas offer shade.  We've eaten both lunch and dinner at the Miller and never been disappointed.  Look forward to coming back soon.

Jane",4
"One of our first outside patio experiences in the COVID -19 2nd Phase and it was very enjoyable to be back at an old favourite of ours. The service jolly, staff wearing the masks correctly , food great and great ambiance. We  will be back again Nicholas and Michelle PAiraudeau",4
A very pleasant place to have lunch. Food and service excellent.,3
Lovely ambiance on the patio.  Very enjoyable.  Menu could be a little more extensive.,4
Very good protocols in place to ensure you are safe.,4
"Well it‚Äôs not fair to judge when restaurants are currently limited to socially distanced outdoor seating. The multi-level patio layout was nice, but be aware that accommodations might be necessary for your party if there are mobility issues or people who require more generous seating than a narrow metal armchair can provide. (You might want to note it in your reservation so you aren‚Äôt dealing with the situation after you arrive.)

My steak was excellent, the best ‚Äúblue rare‚Äù I‚Äôve had in a long time. It made up for the fries, which were plank-cut, frozen and mealy, though they were served with a tasty malt vinegar mayonnaise. I ordered a decaf coffee, which had not been made recently and arrived in a half-size cappuccino cup accompanied by two milkettes, of which one was curdled. Despite its small size and poor quality, the coffee cost about the same as you‚Äôd pay at a fancy coffee place. (Then again, it‚Äôs called the Miller Tavern, not the Miller Caf√©, so I should have known better.)

The service people were lovely, professional and friendly without being ingratiating. Our waiter was not hurried, even at times when he could have been checking up on us a bit more often. I was worried about the online notice that we only had our table for an hour and a half, but a midweek lunchtime seemed to be more relaxed than the warning would imply.

The menu is not great for allergies and special diets, but if those are not a concern you can get more reasonable options than steak. That being said, it was very good steak.",2
"As always, the food at the Miller was fabulous, the staff were delightful, and the setting was beautiful.   Our wonderful waiter, who has helped to make many of our evenings very pleasant,  remembered us, welcomed us back as old friends, and made the experience very special.   I often recommend the Miller Tavern to my friends.",4
The menu was limited and  I understand why but I hope in the near future they will expand it,3
Patio is amazing and very relaxing although table chairs are not overly comfortable. My friend ordered the half chicken dish which was delicious. I had the salmon which I found far too salty. Servicer was lovely.,4
"Peter, our waiter, was absolutely amazing. He was very aware of our needs along with his section. He was very energetic and easily made conversation with myself and my date. We only came for drinks, but he was able to provide entertainment as well.",4
"Great to get out. Safety wise, everything looked good.
Service was great. A little noisy on the west end of the patio with busy road right beside.
Food was OK, no complaints. Always find this place a little pricey but these days, I'm just happy to be out again.",4
"It would be better if the servers had those transparent masks, so we could see their facial expressions! 
The servers were so nice!",3
Our meal at the Miller Tavern was excellent.  The patios are set up beautifully and there was much care given to watching out for covid.  The servers and greeters wore masks and there was hand sanitizer upon entering and placed around.  The tables were a safe distance apart.  The waitress was excellent and our food was delicious.  We recently moved in near by and were very happy to discover a place we will return to frequently.,3
It was wonderful to get out again to see friends and The Miller was an excellent choice. The atmosphere was very upbeat as EVERYONE (including our lovely server) was so happy to be back. We thought the reduced menu was very well thought out and the idea of downloading the menu on to our phones was brilliant. We felt that everything was done to keep us safe and to make our lunch a happy one. Thanks!!!,3
Nice ambiance and service. Thought the menu could have appealed more. Daily sandwich. Fried Clams. ?,2
Was impressed with the precautions taken for Covid. Had my first meal on a patio with my 80 year old aunt and she felt very safe. Great food. Attentive service. Thank you.,4
All was good but sitting next to yonge st made it very loud. Service was outstanding,3
Call directly for a reservation.  I was bombarded with texts and emails after booking on Open Table.  I will not use it again.,3
"Great place, nice ambiance very friendly and professional staff, food could use a bit more selection, but overall food is delicious",4
"Looking for a great patio?  Look no futher....Miller Tavern have many options available and really great service.
Don't forget your mask - necessary if you want to visit the washrooms :D",4
"Good food good service
Good COVID precautions",3
We always love the Miller.  The food is fabulous and the service excellent.  And they never rush you at all.  Good that their patio is open during these Covid19 times.,4
Felt totally safe. Safety protocols were great,4
"The food was excellent the venue very nice although due to the shrubs, very buggy and I have quite a few bites on one of my arms , my neck and legs. You may want to consider some kind of deterrent for the mosquitoes. 
The service was ok.",3
Food was terrific and good value.  Mostly pub fare.  Great for a patio.  It‚Äôs a beautiful setting. Mix of younger and older crowds. Would definitely return.,4
"We have been going to the Miller for years, especially in summer... a great local spot.  Really good, personalized service from staff.  Food has really improved since last year. Gotta love the half price afternoon deal.",4
Frankly it was just nice to get out and the weather held out,3
"Went to Miller Patio and surprised to see three levels of seating.  Was a great lunch and felt safe dining out.  There were no menus, you downloaded them onto your phone.  A plate was brought by server with cutlery wrapped in linen napkin.  No condiments on table, that‚Äôs fine as the salmon with lentils and spinach was delicious.  Was warm that day but a breeze was coming in and we were on top patio.   Traffic Noise behind us but next time will ask for middle patio.  Server Meghan was bringing cold bottles of water and ice cubes throughout our experience.  They also had special signage to arrive safely at washrooms with a cute ‚ÄúWash your hands you Filthy Animal‚Äù above the sink.  The Lower  patios had plush pillow patio sets and each one was cozy and away from other diners.  The lunch was lovely and being out dining was definitely a highlight!",3
"I have been to Miller‚Äôs many times for many different occasions.  I understand the circumstances of this experience is not all within their control. However, the quality of the food and the value of the experience is not something that should ever be compromised.  After all, why do we go to a restaurant?!?  I know Miller‚Äôs will be better again, just hope it will be soon.",1
Great Customer service,4
Amazing atmosphere in a great location. The multi level patio was perfect and accommodating. The food is well above your average pub fare. We sat on the upper patio which is closer to yonge St. so the noise was a little louder but still very bearable in an amazing setting.,4
Anniversary,4
"Good was great, social distancing and sanitizer excellent . Great to have the beautiful patio open again . Also smart to completely remove paper menus",3
Beautiful patio set up. Felt extremely safe dinning in.,4
Amazing food and staff,4
"It was a beautiful day and so nice to be back.  We live across the street and have really missed coming there in the last 4 months!  
Thanks for the incredible service!!",4
Awesome to head out to a patio. Great service and food... casual.,4
"Reason to go was for the patio not the food.not bad for first day back from the pandemic closure. Our waiter was so overwhelmed with his tables. I think they didn‚Äôt expect the high numbers. For what you get the food is not worth the portions BUT like I said I wanted to experience their beautiful patio minus the honking horns and screeching tires on the busy younge street. It will take time for them ,like all food establishments to adapt to the new norm of this COVID era.",2
"Service was fast, waitress was kind, the ambiance was soothing on a beautiful sunny day. Great price for good food! Will definitely go back in the summer.",4
Although the food wasn't bad since you are offering brunch items on the menu on Saturdays some of which come with toast when we asked for peanut butter and/or jam were told you did not have these?????  Why???  Not an outstanding experience.,2
"The soup was excellent, the mussels good the noise level high.",2
"Service was great. Due to large parties at the restaurant, our food was served late.  Our server kept us informed and she gave us complimentary desserts. 

Overall, a great night out at Miller Tavern.",4
None of our party liked the new menu. Smaller portions (Higher prices) and less variety. Used to really like this restaurant.,2
Great service by Craig.,4
"i always look forward to eating at the miller.  Our server was terrific, understanding we were having a business conversation, and not rushing us.  Food was  very good!  However the music noise level was way too high, we couldn't have a comfortable conversation.  We asked the server to turn it down, and she did, but not enough.  Music at high volume seems unavoidable in restaurants, and for that reason, we try to have  conversations and meetings away from these venues.  It really was entirely too loud.  Perhaps you can reconsider the reasons for having such high volume, and lower it for more repeat customer visits.",3
"Good place for family and friends gathering. Nice service.
Food was fantastic, however, their raw oyster was disappointed. It was too small and not so worth the money.",3
"Steak was overdone and over priced. 

Service was awful

The salad was great, however.",0
Not a lot of choice for food and a bit expensive for what it offers. Otherwise the food was well prepared and the service very good.,2
Loved the environment and the food. Definitely a place to visit again in the future.,4
Was a lovely place to spend Valentine‚Äôs Day! Will be back!,4
Great food and service was very nice!!!! Very relaxin experience and would go back in a heartbeat,4
Excellent Lunch - seafood offerings were fantastic and the service was perfect.,4
"Appetizers were good, main and dessert were mediocre.  Very friendly service, but long periods of waiting between courses",2
"We've been to this restaurant many times--but this was the first time in about 6 months. the menu has changed dramatically---and from our standpoint, they have taken many of our  favorites off the menu and substituted some items that we rarely would eat at a restaurant--eg. Lamb Shank, for one.

we still like the ambience, service, etc.---but would hope that the menu changes again for our next visit and adds back some of the discontinued options",3
"Used to be our popular hangout place but service keeps declining yesterdays visit really prompt me writing this review ,no manager any where around slow service our waitress was bartending and tending our table each time she came by our table was 15 minutes dessert came in 20 minutes after it was ordered and no apology until it was brought to her attention the lack of service",2
"Jeff our sever was outstanding. Friendly, engaged and efficient. I had the evening special Prime Rib dinner. Extremely tender and flavourful. The dinner included a Yorkshire Pudding but no gravy. That would be a miss. The horseradish could also be a little hotter, it had very little bite. 

The calamari appetizer was properly cooked and very tasty. 

The other guests in our party thoroughly enjoyed their meal as well. 

All in all a very enjoyable experience.",4
Nice Sunday brunch.,3
Best service and server ! Food was delicious hit the spot,4
"The service was slow and very unfriendly, wait staff were not helpful in identifying gluten/dairy free items. Sandy to be specific.
Menu was limited and didn't offer much for those with gluten or dairy restrictions.
Two other tables were having cell phone conversations using their speakers while they ate so the rest of us were able to hear every detail - whether we wanted to our not.
The toast was dry and cold.
Coffee was warm, not hot.
Manager was indifferent.",1
Great service by Craig,4
Menu is not Plant Base friendly at all,2
"What a disappointment! We were frequent customers when we lived closer. And we had a wonderful dinner as early as last summer on the lovely patio when we took overseas guests to the Miller Tavern. This past week, we suggested meeting another couple for dinner there. After our meal, they said they were ""definitely underwhelmed."" I had to apologize for suggesting th place. My husband and I were shocked how much it had changed for the worse.  First, our waiter insisted that there was a cherry hidden among the ice cubes in my (watery!) Manhattan cocktail. I had to prove that there wasn't by stirring my fork around the glass. He then brought me two cherries. I was craving steak frites, but now it's only available at lunch. The menu is much smaller and less interesting. We split a very ordinary Caesar salad. My husband's $24 hamburger was the size of a slider and he said the chips were not as good as in the past. My Cornish hen and mashed potato was bland without the sauce it was supposed to come with. The waiter told the kitchen to leave it off because I'd said that I have gluten intolerance. But he should have told me there was gluten in that sauce before I ordered it. I might have chosen something else. I'd read the place was closed for renovations in the fall, but apart from a few missing pictures on the wall, it looked the same. When I mentioned that to the young man at the front desk, he said just the kitchen was renovated.  He also said one of the owners had retired and the other had hired a management company to run the place - and, apparently, to make cuts in order to maximize profits. He actually told me the prices had gone down. I saw no evidence of that, compared with our dinner last summer. When I asked him how I could complain to management about no steak frites at dinner, he said, ""I'm management."" He told me to write a review on OpenTable. Well, here I am. Unless it goes back to being as good as it used to be, we won't be back.",1
Ordered food around 7:15.   We were told an hour later that our order  was lost by the kitchen so we needed to reorder.  Our food came after 9.,0
Good food.   Way too fast.,3
Our waitress was very calm and made recommendation when it was necessary,4
"Some dishes were good others were just okay.
Coconut dessert seemed to be missing the coconut. Sticky toffee and chocolate molten dessert were good.
Fish and chips was okay, needed a better batter.
Server was attentive and helpful",2
"2 salads, 2 coffee and 1 gingerale,   over $70.     Cannot hold business lunches here going forward as prices are too high",2
Had a very good experience! Was impressed with the food!,3
A pub good at tgat level,3
"We were at Miller's for brunch yesterday.  We were disappointed that the upstairs was closed as we feel it is a nicer place to sit.  We found the downstairs very dark.  My order was described as yogurt with granola, preserved fruit and maple syrup.  I requested no maple syrup and they forgot which made the dish too sweet.  When I asked the waitress where the fruit was, she told me the kitchen put prunes in it.  There were only 3 prunes and were tasteless - not a good choice for this dish (berries would be a much better choice) The whole thing came across as overly sweet vanilla yogurt with some crunchy oatmeal on top.  The rest of our party felt their meals were acceptable but nothing they couldn't have ordered elsewhere for less money.  All in all not a great experience and we will not be coming back.",2
"Went with family, we all love this place. Amazing food and ambience! Highly recommended.",4
Ok service but the place is poorly lit...it could have a better tasting food.,1
"We were a party of 6 celebrating the birthdays of my adult daughter and son. The service was good and the server appropriately attentive. Menu choices have been peered down and at first glance you want to check for more options. Yet everyone was quickly able to find something on the menu and enjoyed their choices. The calamari and crab cake appetizers were good, as were the cocktails ordered. The Cornish Hen, fish & chips and burger mains were tasty. 
The only real down-side was that we were seated downstairs which we all found to be very draughty and chilly.",3
"The best mussel I have had in a long time. Just like the ones in La Boqueria , Barcelona. Plump and juicy - cooked just right.",4
"The medium-well steak was overdone unfortunately, though everything else was very tasty",3
"New Years Eve. We all but one had the lobster. There were 5 of us who had the lobster & everyone enjoyed it!! Service as always, was great!",3
Enjoyed the live band and food was excellent!  Would recommend the Chop salad,4
Our waitress Liz was outstanding. Great food.,4
Not as high end as we were expecting.,2
"Great service by Craig. Happy with his recommendation! 
The fish and the side dishes were delicious!!",4
"Great food, good service.",3
"My steak arrived well done even though I asked for the steak medium rare. The mistake was acknowledged and I eventually received a steak medium rare. However, not a great way to celebrate my 50th birthday. 

Secondly, Aris and I are regulars at the Miller. However, we are tremendously disappointed that the cheese plate was removed from the menu. It was the main reason (along with the extensive wine list) we would go to The Miller. Without the cheese plate option, we will be going to The Miller less frequently. Just wanted to register our disappointment. I understand new owners-smaller menu but you have lost some ‚Äòregulars‚Äô in the process. 

Lastly, Monica is our favourite server. She is very knowledgeable about the menu (and the cheese!) and if we do make reservations again, it‚Äôs will be because of Monica. 
 Sincerely,
Keri Rickwood-Zakinthinos",3
"I‚Äôve never been disappointed with meeting friends at Miller Tavern. Conveniently located (near both the 401 for guests from away, & near the TTC Yonge subway line) it is one of my favourite places to meet. The food selection is superb, whether for weekend brunch or dinners, as is the beverage menu. Highly recommended!",3
"Wonderful ambiance and good service but the food was disappointing.  Plates filled with potatoes, poor presentation.  Not the usual quality we knew under previous ownership",1
"There was little to no music on the patio section. Other than that, service and food is great.",3
"Good neighbourhood location.  2 of us had the burger and were very disappointed, the other one had the Cornish hen and enjoyed it.
Service and staff were very friendly and efficient",2
"It was good, it seemed every draft beer we were interested in ordering you were out of.  Overall it was a good experience.  We visit this restaurant and patio quite often.",3
There was a party reserved and it was busier than usual and absolutely no parking.,4
"We enjoyed our evening at the Miller.

Larry and Wendy",3
Used to recommend. Not after this week. Food quality and flavour. was poor,1
Need extra servers. Our server was charming and lovely but he could have used help.,4
"We were very unhappy having our staff Christmas lunch and finding out brunch is only being served
Will not likely book again there",1
New menu. Not impressed. Very generic. Meat and potatoes!  Used to have a few interesting/variety of dishes. Now just run of the mill.,4
"Bethany was a fantastic Server.  Fast, friendly and efficient.",4
Great dinner,4
"Service was great and food was excellent.
Company Christmas lunch and price was great too.",4
"I'm giving The Miller (Yonge St) a low rating mostly because of the value for food & drinks. As usual, after the meal, you feel you've paid WAY too much for the quality received. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Tartar that's on the new menu, along with a side salad. The OLD MENU AHI TUNA was MUCH BETTER! The new Ahi just comes in a bowl with 2 salted crackers that don't go well with the tuna. I'm missing the old chips and wasabi paste, etc. for the old menu. PLEASE bring it back. I'm also missing the old menu Buddha Bowl AND SWEET POTATO FRIES! The atmosphere and service is excellent, but the price of menu items is greatly inflated. The new menu also has the smallest writing - needs to be much larger with a better font. When they re-print the menu, lower the prices & bring back the old Ahi Tuna, Buddha Bowl and Sweet Potato Fries, I'll be more likely to go back.",2
"The service was excellent. The food took over an hour to come to our table but it was lunch on December 11th, so it was extremely busy.",3
Best diner for simple well prepared meals served promptly by friendly servers.,4
"A pleasant surprise! Service was attentive but not overbearing. Food was very good with discounted prices on some appetizers during happy hour, and mains were generous portions. We sat in a large booth, perfect for our group of friends. Noise level was tolerable for most of the evening, which we all appreciated. Great value.",3
Great for an evening out with the girls!,4
Never disappointed. Excellent service.,4
Craig as always provides the best service!!!,4
"Fish and chips had too much batter and oil
Cesar salad - fresh but without taste
Lamb shank was  not tasty - just flat 
Veg soup was good and had a smoky taste to it- not sure if it was the bacon",3
Dark bar/restaraunt.  Service was sllllllloooooowwwww,0
"server did a great job. No complaints, only issue, the reservation app claimed we did not show up on time. Meanwhile we did! Please make sure the software works properly. We were there right at 7 PM as per our reservation.",4
Local spot with good service - solid menu and upscale bar area and a nice outdoor covered patio heated in winter,3
"The area we sat in was cold. The place was not full but service was slow. New menu items are different than previous; however, nothing special and overpriced.",2
I gave 1 star because I couldn‚Äôt do 0!!! WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! from our rude server to dry dishes and having the manager come to our table to yell at us ! It was just so horrible. Don‚Äôt waste your time and money if you‚Äôre looking for a fun night with quality food. This place used to be good at one point not anymore ! Too bad !,0
The menu recently changed and is not as diversified as before.  It was ok but not very inspired. Waiter had an attitude and was not attentive.     Men's washroom was freezing cold and so was the water to wash your hands.  The restaurant was reasonably full so perhaps it was just our bad luck.,2
"I had made a reservation for 8 people for a surprise birthday party I organized for my boyfriend. The waitress took our drink orders and then dinner. First everyone except my boyfriend got their food. My boyfriends meal finally came and the mash potatoes were stone cold, as was the steak. Another persons food also arrived cold.  I sent his plate back and we all had to start eating while he sat with an empty plate. Service afterward was spotty. I felt like I had to keep looking for a server. I ordered a bottle of wine that was out of stock and requested another. 
I am not one to look for a ‚Äúfree meal‚Äù but there was no compensation offered for the cold food, meal delay, and wine being unavailable. We paid in full for the meal, spare a complimentary glass of Prosecco that was offered to us. 
So much potential, just needs a bit more care and attention to detail. Make your customers feel like you care! Especially when they are there to celebrate a special event.",2
Great service and food.  Good for small or large groups as well as romantic dates!,4
I went for brunch and had the brioche French toast with a side of bacon. It was delicious. The bacon was perfectly cooked and the portion sizes were good.,4
"I don't think I've ever had a bad experience at Miller. Food is always delicious, service is great, atmos is the best part, especially suring summer with all the storm doors open, amazing.",4
The old menu was superior and we love the ambience . We come at least twice a month but if they keep that new menus and change decor we will change to The Keg. Keg has better value and better choices than your new menu and we almost left due to that,1
"As always, outstanding.  We just wish that lived much closer so we can enjoy a nice steak more often.
Thank you for another great dining experience.",4
I found the menu to be uninspired and the taste of the food bland.  Wanted to like it.,1
Had a terrific time with a family.,4
Always a great place to bring a client for a business meeting,4
"Miller Tavern is my go to choice for getting together with friends. Imagine our disappointment with the changes following the recent kitchen reservation. Favourite dishes - seafood salad plate - gone! In its place an expensive and less appealing seafood platter. Lots of pricey steaks that don‚Äôt attract us. We settled for the (now single) crab cake. Even more disappointing is the change to the wine list. Not one big red by the glass worth drinking. We considered a bottle - which we couldn‚Äôt finish. Few familiar wine choices from LCBO, instead a selection of private list wines with big mark-ups, worst of all most don‚Äôt rate over 3-stars. DARN! I‚Äôm hoping they address some of these irritating changes.",2
"Food was delicious but the service needs attention.  Our server, though polite, was not very enthusiastic, nor ""happy"" to be serving us.  Missed on a number of things....  service of the meals...crossing over in front of myself to serve another guest, no salt/pepper/etc was brought over.  We got up & got our own.  We had brunch there.  Did not ask if we wanted a coffee, dessert after our meal.  Brough my coffee, with spilt beverage on the saucer with not apology, clean up..  No spoon with my service, no sugar, which I had to ask for.  And again brought the bill & reached over across me to give it to the person paying.
We sat in the indoor""patio"" extension upstairs which was very airy & bright.
Still might try it again.",2
Disappointed with menu (apparently they are making changes) and ordered portobello burger .... which was a beef burger with some mushroom I guess in it ..... I didn‚Äôt eat it (my mistake for not checking but portobello is normally served in place of meat and it actually didn‚Äôt say beef in the outline) and ordered a very average salad instead which took a long time to arrive . My dinner companion also got a hair on the plate but given the issues I had didn‚Äôt even mention it .   I will not be returning,1
I arrived and found out kitchen was closed.  They should have contacted me in advance.,0
"Good experience overall. Excellent Wait Person. A bit load, but nice room etc. The only letdown was less than an interesting menu. On the other hand, the food was tasty and well-prepared.",3
"I have been to Miller tavern before but this is first time I was back in a long time and service has gone down.  Although we were a large group, they took far to long to serve us.  Very disappointed.",2
"Tried and true local spot - quality food, good service and nice atmosphere - BUT - needs a re-fresh - looking tired and worn inside/tables/furnishings. Like a dependable friend you know what to expect - just needs a new wardrobe ;) or a fresh lick of paint",3
"Nice dinner, server was a little too attentive. Too many interruptions.",4
Only the kitchen was renovated and the menu is shortened.  Miss the Prime Rib (served only on Sat/Sun).  Service is good but the decor needs some change for sure.   Looks like a glorified pub (downstairs) without the TV screens upstairs.,3
"Food, service and staff all excellent but the noise level wasn‚Äôt energetic it was just way too loud and made
Talking extremely difficult. We were sitting downstairs where the ceilings are low so that didn‚Äôt help the situation.",3
Much better than before. Very good server; the noise and music can be better.,4
My friend and I were very disappointed at the choices on the new menu.,2
Very poor service. The cappuccino and lattes were undrinkable and though we were not charged for them no offer or apology was offered. It was very noisy in our area. Overall I would not return readily.,1
Just okay.  New menu was greatly reduced and just  average.  Miss being able to order dim sum.,2
"A restaurant where you can have a conversation without yelling, AMAZING!",4
"I absolutely loved the food, management and the service was exquisite",4
Over priced food and our food was over cooked when the manager took it back all he offered was a drink for my child  who had to wait an extra almost half hour for his steak to be re made. Won‚Äôt go back.,1
Server did a horrible job of answering our questions about popular food- also took an hour after ordering appetizers to ask our order for mains!,1
Pleasant dinner on closed patio - enjoy exploring new menu - Scotch Olives a trea,3
Service was fast and wait staff courteous.,2
On a quiet Monday evening service was spotty. They got two dishes wrong (one for a celiac). Washroom was appalling. Not nearly what it used to be.,1
"I have been going to the Miller for so many years and this is the first time I have been disappointed.  I was looking forward to seeing the new kitchen items since it re-opened and trying some new things, but oh my, it's not good.  The new menu is out of touch with the neighborhood foodies and business crowd.  There are some odd items too, which seem to be on there as they are cheap, basic food items then sharply marked up.   The burger, a Miller favorite, is still called the Miller burger on the new menu but it is a shadow of its former self, i.e. much smaller.
The wine list has gone down market too.  This is Hogg's Hollow, new management team, not Brampton. 
I would like to add that the bar staff and servers are still fabulous, despite (apparently) quite a bit of negative feedback.",2
"I don't like the new menu,  It is limited.
The noise level was very loud annoying.",3
"Very disappointed.  The portions sizes were extremely small, no presentation and over priced.",1
"We don‚Äôt like the new menu. Our favourite food was removed. Eg : Bruschetta, sliders, Buddha salad.
The fish and chips dish was extremely small portion!",2
Every thing was just okay. Service was relatively slow but efficient. Food was not special except the burrata salad which was above average.,2
"I have been  a regular customer of The Miller since it originally opened. It has recently had menu changes and I did not enjoy the new dinner menu. Some of our old favourites have disappeared and the new dishes are not nearly as delicious. I have also experienced the new luncheon menu which was interesting and I would go back again for lunch and brunch, however, probably not for dinner.",2
"We had a reservation at the Yonge St. location, and were greeted when we arrived.  We had a lovely table in the greenhouse area, but over time, the room filled up and the noise level became so high that we couldn't carry on a conversation at our table.
The food was excellent, especially the clam chowder.
Prices were reasonable but on the higher end.",3
"We love this place!
Always quality service and food.",4
New menu and changes not great. Why change what was a succesful and high quality restaurant. None of the old favorites remain. The wine list is all Consignment products that no one knows (not even the staff) which makes it brutal trying to select a wine all for the sake of being able to charge higher prices because we don't know the wines?? Spoiler alert for the Management.. if I really want to know what you paid I can use google! Staff and servers still the same and very good. Attentive and provide the perfect level of service. Won't be going back..,1
Nice place to meet!,3
Wonderful luncheon spot. Good meeting place location wise. WBD,4
"3 of 5 guests had Fish and chips , fish was extremely greasy. Fries were cold. 1 guest had a burger, it was under cooked and ‚Äúwatery‚Äù1 guest had pasta, asked for aldante. It was mush! That it strike 3 , I‚Äôm never coming back.",1
"The new menu is limited in choice and a number of our old favourites are missing - lobster tacos for one. Service remains good and food quality is fine, it just needs a little more imagination",3
"My husband and I took his brother and wife for a 25th anniversary dinner at The Miller Tavern. I had given the restaurant a heads up and we were treated to champagne before our meal and free desserts including sorbet, pie and cake. Very much appreciated by all. Our waiter Tyler was very attentive and polite, great server. Our meals were delicious and included shrimp cocktail, crab parfait, filet mignon, pasta, lamb shank and Cornish hen. Portions were a good size and most of us took home doggie bags to take home and enjoy the next day. A truly wonderful evening and our thanks again to Tyler and other staff members.",4
"Service was great. Good recommendation on the fish and chips. 
New menu is less extensive but some good options. No much for vegetarians",3
Disappointed with the changed menu and decreased food quality. Portions sizes are smaller. Please bring back the original caesar salad and jerk chicken.  The Miller Tavern was our go-to work event spot but no longer!,0
Lousy wine list; mediocre food; expensive for the quality.  Terrific service!,2
"The Miller Tavern.  Our favourite restaurant - but sadly, no more.  We arrived and I had already declared that I wanted the calamari appetizer and my favourite lobster salad.  We sat down at a great table and were handed a new menu.  New menu????  Yes, the Miller Tavern is under new management.  We read the menu and turned the page really hoping for more.  But no, that was it - very limited and NONE of the old favourites.  We actually considered leaving.  But, we decided to keep open mind and try something new.  We both struggled.  Then our server Alex came and he was fantastic at helping us decide what we might enjoy based on the old favourites we new.  After a great glass of wine (thank you, Alex, for the suggestion) we were still struggling with the menu.  They had calamari - would it be like old calamari?  I asked Alex if I could make a meal out of a Caesar salad by adding steak or shrimp or chicken.  Yes he said.  Ok, we will start with the calamari and I will have steak on my Caesar and my husband, still struggling decided on fish and chips.  The calamari was just ok - certainly NOT anything close to the old Miller's calamari.  My Caesar salad was just ok.  The steak was cooked to perfection at my request of medium rare but how the heck is anyone supposed to cut if with that giant steak knife on top of the salad in that serving bowl.  Sorry, but I will go down the street to The Keg restaurant to get a better better less soggy steak Caesar.  My husband said the fish was ok but some of the chips seemed undercooked.  We are soooooo sad to have lost our favourite restaurant.  Sorry, but unless some of the old favourites are put back on the menu, we do not plan to return.",0
The new menu looks awesome!! Looking forward to returning to sample more!,4
"New owners, new menu. 
We came to the Miller for some specific menu items that are no longer offered, so we were disappointed. 
For example, the Lobster salad and Lobster quesadillas, two of our favourites, are no longer offered.
Won't be going back in a hurry.",2
Lovely!   Fun!,4
"Miller has revamped its menu and style. The website has been down for some time, so we were unaware of the changes.  It's no longer a seafood/steakhouse, but offers a slightly upmarket pub menu  Prices are reasonable, but with very small portions. 

Been to the Miller many times over the years, as a lively steakhouse, but now it's just another mid-range restaurant.

We had very pleasant service which improved the experience.",1
"Great to have OUR north Toronto location open again.

Same pleasant staff and warm ambiance .",3
"Quiet, elegant and comfortable for business meetings.",4
New menu is a welcome change and the burger was excellent.  Service very good,4
"Had a business meeting at the Miller Tavern, and the location was idea for people travelling, the food was amazing and service staff were very attentive. Prices were reasonable given the value. Definitely worth checking it out.",3
"I would refer friends, but a little bummed on the new menu. Very limited and small and prices are largely higher, didn't seem to be a change for the better. The food and selection was much better before.",2
I would give 3.5 if possible. Appetizers were good and one persons steak was as requested. Three of us presses the prime rib all medium rare. What we got was quite rare and very tough to cut and chew. We should have complained but didn‚Äôt. I think it‚Äôs a decent spot and worth giving another shot but wasn‚Äôt a must go place,2
Experience made doubly good with the wonderful attitude of the server.  Amanda was knowledgeable about the new menu items and thoroughly helpful in choice of wines and beverage options.,3
"The new menu has some very delightful healthier choices. Thank you. However not much in the way of Vegan choices. It was nice to see the staff in new attire. I like the clearer hallways upstairs near the bar & seeing into the back dinning rooms, it feels much friendlier. There was a definite improvement in the washroom. I look forward to more changes. Maybe s bit more lighter choices on the menu and or shareable snacks",3
Excellent meal and our server Howie was superb! And the coffee was amazing thanks also to Patera for the coffee!!!!,4
We have been eating at the miller for years as we live nearby.  We were excited to try the new menu but unfortunately we did not feel it was a change for the better.  The menu is more limited and has fewer share plates.  We also thought the prices were high for the food we received.  One person in our party had the seafood platter but there was not much on it for $55.  The King salmon was a reasonable portion ( on the smaller side) but either the salmon or the grains it was on  was extremely salty - almost inedible. One person at our table had a poultry dish ( Cornish hen maybe?) and it was a large portion and thought it was quite good . We ate in the upstairs dining room.  I don‚Äôt know if the downstairs room has the same menu or if they have a more casual and shareable menu- I hope so because otherwise we probably won‚Äôt be back as we usually liked to eat once a week at the miller for a casual meal.,2
"I took a group of 7 here for dinner for a business dinner....won‚Äôt be back. 

5 of the 7 had appetizers and it took a long time for them to come out and then they forgot one.

Entrees took an incredibly long time to come out and they were average at best. One colleague had the salmon, small portion, full of bones and salty. (They comped it but we weren‚Äôt looking for freebies, just good food, well prepared and served in a timely manner).

The server was apologetic and brought a round of Prosecco at the end of the meal which we left on the table as we were all driving. 

The frustrating part is that a manager walked through the room at least 4 times past our table and didn‚Äôt recognize any issues (or did and didn‚Äôt do anything) and never stopped to speak to us once.

I apologize to my group and assured them we wouldn‚Äôt be going there again.

Very disappointing.",2
The setting was lovely but the menu very expensive and the portions small. I felt the restaurant was overpriced and pretentious.,2
Excellent food and service made for an enjoyable lunch.,4
"Service pleasant but not responsive. Server would disappear for too long. Caesar salad had too much dressing, burger was good.",1
"Always a nice place for a meal Good service, free parking and half priced red wine. What more could one want.",3
"I am a Senior with enough $$$.   I have co-hosted parties at your venue.   We had lunch there August 27 at 1:00 pm...upstairs.    I do not plan on returning again.    For quality of food served, prices have become outrageous and to add insult to injury my martini was watered down.    When you charge $22.50 for a very average Cobb salad and there is no bread offered or fresh, crisp greens on plate (limp and tired) and avocado minimal the only sunshine were the slices of white (dry) chicken.   My friend ordered a lobster salad.   Expectation was green salad with chunks of lobster, etc.   What arrived was lobster in small half-shells topped with a sort of watery relish.  The lobster had to be picked out of shell after relish was scraped off.  Not much lobster, lots of effort.    Again very expensive and without style or imagination for the price.     

I have ignored overpriced food  in the past because of your location, nice staff, easy parking, and attractive restaurant.   Sadly, there will be no more meals at Miller Tavern for me or mine.",2
"Server was wonderful.  
Disappointed that menu offered was not name as on website -- many items no longer available.  One of our party has serious dietary issues and could only order soup and a salad.",3
Restaurant is very dated and there was an unappetizing odour near the bar. Food was dull and service was okay.,1
"I know renovating will start soon, which is good. The bathrooms are never up to par!!! 
The menu & food selection is outdated. I understand there is a new menu for the new look. 
Please don‚Äôt forget the gardens!!! 
I can help as part of my business is landscaping. Trust me it doesn‚Äôt have to be expensive. 
Overall we love that it‚Äôs close by location for us & we love the staff! 
It‚Äôs a beautiful historical venue, definitely a place to bd proud of.",3
Very pleasant...staff friendly..food good.,3
The food was delicious. Elizabeth our server was so pleasant and very knowledgeable whether it was about the food or alcoholic beverages,4
"Great place for a business lunch due to close proximity to the office.  

Service was decent, prompt but lacking in pleasantries, and a few things forgotten from the order. 

When booking I confirmed it was a new hire lunch so i was surprised to see the lack of enthusiasm by the server. Next time I host an employee welcome lunch I will try to pick a restaurant with staff who can add the finesse and help create the ambiance we are looking for that makes our staff feel valued.",2
"The food was excellent and so was the service, it was my friend's first time at Miller Tavern and she was very impressed,  what makes it extra nice is that you don't feel like you are in the middle of a city dining in the country.  Thank you. N.D.",4
"Poor service.  Felt untaken care of.  We ordered a soup. Had to wait for the spoon. When we asked about suggestions what to order, we were advised to order the most expensive item on the menu.",0
"Always a good place to be but it is looking very dated, especially the downstairs area.",2
Maybe.   Just very expensive for a meal.  Service not great but acceptable.,3
Excellent service!,3
"Our server Brooklyn was outstanding.
We have always enjoyed the food in the Miller. We often come to the restaurant and always have a great experience!!! Great staff.",4
"Good hamburgers and fries, nice patio, delicious cold Provencal rose and excellent server!",3
Great food. Great service.  Have been here for dinner several times before and never got disappointed. It is a bit pricey but the quality of the food absolutely justifies it.,4
"I ordered 2 burgers without onions, and I got 2 burgers with onions :/ salmon was good, but disappointed our server didn‚Äôt catch up the onions on one burger",1
Very good service and meal. Staff was very attentive and helpful without being overly so. Highly recommend for a business lunch.,4
The bar staff are so great!   Love the food at the Miller.  Less than impressed with the management team decidsing to come and have a large loud meeting right beside our table while we were dining.,3
"This was the perfect place for our business lunch.  We will consider this venue for similar meetings, in the future.",4
"we always enjoy meeting at Miller Tavern.  The food never disappoints, service is great and it's not a loud place so we can hear each other speak.  
Keep up the great work!",4
Awesome patio! Great food!,4
The brunch was great!  Food was good and the patio was awesome!,4
Excellent as always! Great service!!!,4
"Group sat on Verandah as patio closed due to rain forecast.  While hot it was lovely with open windows and fans.  Service was excellent and very attentive. We had the lunch menu with appetizers, Cobb salads, lobster rolls amongst our group.  All delicious.  Free parking.",4
Disappointed as they took off so many favourites off the happy hour menu and the regular menu too,3
The staff tried hard to deflect the lack of panache.,2
"Dirty chairs and very very dirty table, service was not okay up to the standard of my previous visits with the family,",1
Food was amazing! Service was ok-could have asked if we wanted anything such as another drink-definitely just okay nothing wrong but not attentive or anticipatory of customer needs/ wants.,3
Very nice experience all over!,4
"While the food was good, prices were quite steep, particularly for the steaks. Unfortunately, in one case, though the steak was cooked as requested, the quality of the meat was not at the expected standard. Service was very average at best which struck our group as odd given that the restaurant wasn't too busy.",2
"An upscale place for business or personal meetings, wonderful patio/outdoor experience, lots of shade or sun depending on your preference. A varied menu with a great selection of beers on tap and wine by the bottle or glass.",4
"I was still hungry after the seafood salad. It was good, however perhaps more salad or vegetables could‚Äôve been given.",3
Beautiful patio and wonderful Steak and Seafood dishes.,3
"The restaurant provides various choices in sea food and stakes, good combination with authentic Italian, American and creative food. You can always find an appropriate one, and the quality of food has been quite stable, definitely worthy to come back again.",4
Very nice patio- my friend and I had the ‚Äúthis and that‚Äù platter which was quite expensive considering that it was a small amount of food and also nothing special taste-wise. The mango ice cream was delicious and very natural tasting. The service was SUPER slow and our waitress was almost never around. Maybe we didn‚Äôt know to order the right things... but I didn‚Äôt find that the place is worth the high prices so I wouldn‚Äôt return.,2
"As usual, my experience at Miller Tavern was great! I don't get there very often, but when I do, I always enjoy my meal and the service!",4
"We enjoy The Miller and the patio is beautiful. Our experience was only hampered by one very rude and inconsiderate patron who parked his vintage sportscar in the spot right up against the patio line. Aside from the incredible noise of the engine, the car also wreaked od gas and exhaust fumes and this traveled to and lingered on the patio for quite some time.  Naturally, this did not enhance the dining experience for anyone on what was a booked solid Saturday night on your patio.  My suggestion is that you make that parking spot a ""special consideration"" spot during patio months at least to avoid this from happening again. Your parking lot is huge and anyone requiring handicapped parking is not driving a sports car of that nature. 

Aside from that we enjoyed our meal very much although we waited a little too long to be visited by our waiter to place our drink order after we were seated. 

My salmon was cooked beautifully and I would order it again.",3
"My family had a Saturday brunch at Miller Tavern, we sat in patio, it was cozy. My kids had Kids Menu, they both ordered chicken finger with fries, the meat and the fries all completely over fried, the color turned brown, of cause the meat was dry. I ordered Fritatta with fries, same situation, which cost me 19.5 bucks! The taste was really so so. No bread, butter or any drink was included in the menu. Generally, it as over-priced. Not recommend.
The worst is they added two juices into my bill, which were supposed to be included in Kids Menu, I found  out and ask them to correct. Oups!",1
"A local eatery near work that can do it casual and a bit upscale - good for clients , staff and partner get togethers 
Nice outdoor patio and a heated covered patio / balcony for the four seasons",3
"Our table was waiting for us in a perfect location! Great food, great service ... would highly recommend for a nice evening out !",4
We‚Äôve been before and enjoyed it but this time we were very disappointed with the food. Lobster Cobb salad was small and drenched in dressing. Worst cheese platter I‚Äôve ever been served. Seafood platter wasn‚Äôt tasty. I won‚Äôt return.,1
"The location is good and the service excellent.  However,  we did not want to wait in line for the patio since we had made a reservation but the upstairs outdoor/indoor section was not open so we had the choice of waiting in line or sitting in the dark lower section on a beautiful day.

The value on the Old Fashioned cocktail was poor.  Probably only an ounce of bourbon which is typically two ounces for that price.  There was no blue cheese on the cob salad and the prime rid sandwich was meh.

Yes, I'd recommend it because it is consistently moderate.  It never wows but it never disappoints.",2
"The first time going here.  Location is great.  Inside was ok... wasn‚Äôt anything out of the norm but didn‚Äôt really stand out in a special way.  Maybe it is different in the evening.  Waitress was really nice, food was great and arrived in a timely manner. Never felt rushed or anything.  Since we went for lunch the atmosphere was different but would go back to see what it‚Äôs like at night.",3
Great service and food! Carly is outstanding!,4
Overpriced and the Pacific Salmon seemed off.,2
"Great place for friendly meal. Menu is varied, food is good and great choice of drinks.",3
"A very pleasant quiet Anniversary meal at the Miller Tavern, with a good selection of nicely cooked and presented food - very much an upmarket ‚Äútavern‚Äù, which was reflected in the prices.  Excellent staff, very attentive and courteous.",3
"We were at Miller for a farewell to a friend leaving Toronto.  

The wait staff did not rush us and we all had a very good time.",4
This was our first visit and overall a very good experience. Our waiting staff were all very attentive and friendly. Would go back.,4
"It's my 3rd time at Miller Tavern and it's really Good

I recommend this restaurant highly

Andre",4
"It was birthday celebration we went there.  It was on our favorite list.  All was so good...! This place as I heard is popular, so we ordered.  Meals were tasty.  Trust the server‚Äôs recommendations.  People are so nice and friendly.  

The only unfortunate was, that night was raptors game night and once game started, it wasn‚Äôt that quite we needed and expected.  Bit understand was too important.  

we checked one our favorite place, so should you...!",3
"The greeter was initially not very amenable to accommodate ping our party on the patio until I made a suggestion to add a chair at the table. While our server was pleasant, there was absolutely no salesmanship demonstrated. She never asked if we wanted a refresh on our beverages or offered coffee or tea. Our meals were tasty and ample, as usual! 

The ambiance on the patio is lively and welcoming. Thanks for another memorable experience!",3
"Good food, decent atmosphere.  I wish the upstairs had been open.",3
Excellent service lovely patio good food.,3
Excellent service by Craig and great prime rib sandwich,4
"Having lunch with my aunt (88 yr), cousin, and sister proved to be a most enjoyable time. Coming from Oakville, Newmarket and Eglinton, The Miller is the perfect place to meet and we plan to every 6 wks.  Look forward to luncheon on the patio next time.",3
Service was not great wait staff needs work but food was delicious,3
Always a favorite and our server was first class . Lovely place for a Sunday brunch,3
"We had a great server who was very thoughtful. Unfortunately our food was not to the same standard as the service was at this restaurant. Parts of the food came out cold and we were missing items to go with the meal. Perhaps it was because of how late our reservation was? Regardless, we had an excellent server and he was able to provide us with an enjoyable dinning experience.",3
"It was our anniversary and we were very surprised to have glasses of champagne and chocolate fondu on the house! 
It was really nice of them and we really appreciated!
Thank you again!",4
Great service from friendly hosts. The steak was delicious.,4
Delicious food and amazing service. The perfect lunch!,4
"Had a great time cheering on the historical basketball game!
The Raptors won game one of the first NBA Champion game against the Golden State Warriors.
The staff, service and food was delicious.
Thank you to all for a memorable eveningüéá‚õπÔ∏èüèÄüçπüç∏ü•∞",4
Had a very nice lunch with 2 friends I had not seen in a year.  Our waitstaff person was very attentive and did not rush us.  We had a leisure lunch and were able to relax and  enjoy our time together.  The food although it is very good can be pricey for what you get.   I would recommend Miller Tavern to my friends and family.,3
"Service out standing, food done to perfection and it was quiet so we could have a good conversation. I will be back.",4
Awesome as always.,4
"Our visit was a real disappointment, especially given that this is an iconic Toronto landmark. Our waiter was quite inattentive, the food mediocre and the place noisy, but the prices were at 5-star levels. We try to avoid chains but we really wish we had just gone to something like The Keg (and that is never really our first choice). Such a shame as this could be a really unique place.",1
Service was good although thought it was a little slow considering it was not busy. One member of our party received a burger which was very undercooked. It was remedied with a freshly cooked one at no charge. However it did have an effect on enjoying a meal together.,3
I commented to Brook that there must be a new chef.! The salmon was perfect! The presentation was wonderful all delicious.,3
"I had hoped for an upstairs table.  The TV screens are not my thing!  Nor is the rather loud music/noise.  That, however, was turned down.  I was shown my table and then had to arrange the benches so we could sit down...  To summarize:  the food and drink were very good, service okay.  I've had much better during previous visits.",2
We has a  very patient waitress who was really good as we were 4 gals who only see each other  times a year and we had a lot of catching up to do.  We finally ordered and the food was very good.  It was noisy but we managed.  We were downstairs and had a nice view out the window.,3
I have been here many times. The food and staff are excellent.  The patio is wonderful as is the upstairs atrium area.  Highly recommend this place.,4
"Good food and healthy choices. Prices are reasonable, and service is good.",3
The waitress during happy hour was especially helpful,4
"We have group get-togethers at the North York location a couple of times a year. The experience has always been outstanding, food, service, in particular.",4
Great neighbourhood place. Good ambience and good is excellent,3
"I realize it was a busy Mother‚Äôs Day, however the piece of meat in my Miller Benedict (as well as my children‚Äôs) was way too thick.
I had looked at the menu online before I went to the restaurant, and was looking forward to the Bacon Benedict. However upon arriving I discovered it wasn‚Äôt available.",3
"I have been attending Mother‚Äôs Day brunch with my family for many years and we have always enjoyed it. The prix fixe menu used to be $30 then $35. It is now $45. I find this is much too high. For a family of 4 it costs well over $200 with tax and tip which is very expensive for this casual restaurant. 
Despite the excellent service, I will not be returning due to the high prices. It‚Äôs unfortunate that my family has to put an end to our Mother‚Äôs Day tradition but we will be going elsewhere next year to a restaurant with more reasonable brunch rates.",3
Great restaurant! Amazing service.  Food was delicious.,4
"Mother's Day brunch was awesome. Six adults, 3 children accommodated without difficulty. Staff were prompt and courteous, food options extensive including vegetarian. All the plates were delicious. This was a 3 course, fixed price menu for Mother's Day brunch: Adults $45/person, children $15. Good value, tasty dishes.",4
Great atmosphere. Food was mediocre but the service was good. Recommended for a family dinner. There were 8 of us and we were able to hear each other well without too much background noise. They also sat us at an oval table which helped keep everyone in the conversation.,3
"Had Breakfast steak and eggs.  
Steak was tough ... I had better AA steaks. 
Both me and my son had the same issue. 

Also waiter was brief and snappy. 
They need to hire people who treat customers with respect. 

Expect better from Miller Tavern.  
Maybe they shouldn‚Äôt be spending so much on the radio advertisements and more money on the quality on their food and service.",1
Mother‚Äôs Day brunch - reasonable price and service.,3
"Just love this place, we continue to go about once a week. Could not like it more. We go when it is just us two, we go mostly with our family of 7 and since a new baby has been added only the time, not the venue has had to change :) Love it, favorite restaurant in the city by far.",4
Outstanding service by Liz . Excellent food.,4
Excellent service by Carly.,4
Fantastic happy hour,3
The Food and service was great. I would definitely return however The noise level did amp up throughout the dining experience. I won't complain as it was a Friday evening and a popular spot!,4
"My crab cakes delicious but served with TWO pieces of greens, you can accompany them with at least some sprouts,lettuce and other greens. Very poor looking plate although the crab cakes are extremely well done and the sauce to eat them wonderful pair.",3
"Congenial staff. Attentive service. Well prepared and delicious food at a reasonable price. What more could you ask for? Noise level in the bar area was too loud for my liking, but it is moderate on the patio upstairs.",3
"Service was fast, but the waitress seemed annoyed (by us) all the time.
It was a lot of noise, even though the restaurant was not even half full. Will not go back there.",1
"Bland vibe, decent food. They need a more uplifting vibe.",3
Hand dryer not working in women‚Äôs bathroom! No paper towels - nothing! Server was ok. Nothing spectacular.  Not too many vegetarian choices.,2
I thought we will be seating upstairs. They should mention it. Not everybody knows. We were celebrating 3 birthdays. It was very noisy we hardly talk. The food was good. The ambiance no. It wasnt the way i planned. Downstairs was dark and very noisy.,2
Four adults had the Halibut which was really delicious! Except one asked for different vegetables under the fish and was specific but it came with different ones she didn‚Äôt like and they said they would do it again and they did but by the time she got her meal we were almost finished ours. The kids meals were great! My grand daughter had a steak which she was very happy with.,3
"I used to,
Quality of food has gone down in 2 years
Service very inattentive -did not feel welcomed or valued",0
"Overall a decent experience. Food was fine, but the service was not good. Our server disappeared for lengthy periods. We had to wait about 20 minutes after we got our bill to be able to pay out.",3
"The  Miller is a comfortable and friendly restaurant to entertain family and friends. We had a birthday dinner there recently. Everyone enjoyed their meals, although there were a few issues. One guest with food allergies asked for a vegetable replacement for peas. She did not receive the replacement vegetable.  The steak in the salad was not cooked enough and was tough. The lemon tart was slightly sweet. Offering guests warm bread would be an asset.

The service was excellent.",3
"Very excellent service, made the Birthday boys, night extra special! Food was soooo yummy!",4
"It was a nice evening overall. It was nice to see Will & of course Howard is always great! 
There was a grey SUV Nissan leaving the parking lot & backed into another car. We were on the balcony so we saw this as did a few other patrons. I have the licence plate if you need it. Sorry for the lateness of my reply

Somewhat dated decor and pricey menu.  Food quality fine but not top notch.,2
Menu seemed a bit pricey but the food quality was there.  Nice afternoon for us.  Would return,3
"I used to really love Miller Tavern, however, I find that the selection has decreased. Additionally, both this time and last time that I visited, I got a bad migraine the day after my visit, despite ordering two different meals. I am not sure if Miller uses MSG in their food, or if the quality has decreased, but unfortunately I don't intend to return.",3
Very enjoyable,4
"Amazing venue, food and service! Such a great spot on the 2nd floor for brunch that overlooks the trees in the summer!!",4
Love the new brunch menu. My party tried 3 different dishes and we loved them!,4
We had a terrible meal there. Food was very slow - although the server was great and kept apologizing for the delays. We wanted over an hour for our steaks and when they arrived neither was cooked as ordered. We sent the food back and when the kitchen fixed it - they were still not as ordered. The manager was not professional and didn‚Äôt take any responsibility. We will not dine there again.,0
Service was very slow. Food was ok but not great. I like the bar but will probably not go back for dinner.,2
"Another great meal at Millers. We started with the cheese board. Excellent variety of cheeses. Our mains were cooked to perfection (steak and prime rib) I am not sure how I managed but I couldn't resist the amazing sticky toffee pudding. Great, relaxing meal.",4
Excellent. Thank you to our lovely and attentive waitress. But please..... do not start clearing dinner plates while someone is still eating.   Food was great!!,4
I was there on a business meeting. The food was delicious. But there was music overhead that was way too loud. And I did not feel comfortable asking the waitress to turn it down.,4
Parking behind the restaurant as is the entrance. Nice atmosphere and decor,4
"Our waiter Jason was very attentive and helpful.
Food was great.",4
Consistently fabulous,4
"Very nice lunch with a former  colleague from work not seen for several years since our retirement. Food, service and atmosphere were all tops and nostalgic, given that Miller used to be the ‚Äúgo to‚Äù place for our former management team reunions.",4
"My husband enjoyed his steak. 
I ordered,  probably the only thing on the menu I haven‚Äôt had. The Cod, it wasn‚Äôt what I expected! It lists on the menu 
Grilled Cod, it was grilled however, skin side up it didn‚Äôt look very appetizing. 
Bok Choy, that was good.
Rice, hard to reck 
Shrimp,  I expected to find them? 
Served with curry sauce, it should have been described as 
Curry soup with a bit of tiny shrimp. 
It doesn‚Äôt look appetizing other then the bok choy peeking out from under the rice & fish skin, not even crispy. It would have look better. 
It wasn‚Äôt in expensive, I seriously expect better. 
The service is always great, but I would love to see some changes on the menu.",2
I really like your restaurant!  The service is excellent and the value is good.  I truly appreciate the fact that I can talk to my friends without having to speak over the noise/music!  This is a plus for me!,4
"I wrote a review last time, did not get a response. 
this time, the upstairs was closed and we were required to sit in the bar area or leave. We were not advised of this ahead of time.  
We chose to stay. 
There was one waitress for the entire area - slow service, too many customers for one server.  I felt bad for the one girl working.  
Not acceptable!",0
Excellent value for the money,4
The Miller Tavern has provided a consistent positive dining experience for many years.,3
The food was not good at all and a bottle of wine that you could buy in the LCBO for $19 was sold for $60. Very overpriced food and wine . My fish was overcooked.,0
"It felt like your average diner. Too bright. The food wasn‚Äôt worth the price at all. 
I had the the prime rib sandwich and the meet was gooey.  Overall very disappointing.",0
Great place but often too noisy for conversation. Great service and foid.,4
Friend‚Äôs birthday,3
"Liz our server is great! She is very attentive and friendly. 
Food and wine was great as always.",4
"It‚Äôs was cold on the enclosed patio and the party of people beside us were VERY loud
Otherwise food great service good",3
They sat our party of 7 at a great table in an upstairs corner away from the hubbub of the lower level. Great for conversation and listening. Great food and great service.,4
Excellent service and food,4
Love the atmosphere. Great food. A wonderful date night with my husband.,4
The right balance of all the elements to provide an enjoyable evening of dining and/or drinks!,3
Excellent service and food. Craig provides outstanding service !,4
"It‚Äôs always a nice experience. Mostly the staff is wonderful 
I feel I need to mention the menu, it‚Äôs limited. I‚Äôm mostly vegetarian but eat fish. My family is a mix some are strictly vegetarian. There are not enough vegetarian dishes.
 I think the steak specials are great! My husband always orders from that menu. As we go out every week, we of course prefer a special. Because of my restrictions, there‚Äôs never a special price.  I also have no problem with smaller servings. 
As for the decor, I understand changes will be coming. It‚Äôs not expensive to have nice accessories. The birch logs were beautiful, simply but lovely. Orchids last for a very long time & not that expensive or a one time investment in good artificial ones, not a bad idea. 
We look forward to sitting in the garden! 
Very loyal patrons.",3
Wonderful!  Great and friendly service and the food is always good,4
Always great place to bring foodies! And we brought some real snobs and they loved it.,4
The quality of the food are not the same as it used to be. There‚Äôs no passion on the food were put in anymore. It used to be top quality but it became just like a typical steakhouse on the street.,2
"I ordered a  Caesar salad which was acceptabe.

My guests order fish and chips which was one of the daily specials.

They were vers disappointed as they found that the fish came with way too much batter.

Oour waitress was very professional and efficient.",1
"problem with paying 
3 of use tried machine 4-5 x",3
"Cheery attentive service which remained very hospitable when we decided to stay and visit long after our meal was over. Our favourite dish - the amazing seafood salad plate didn‚Äôt disappoint. Fresh smoked salmon, shrimp, rare Tuna and a signature crab cake: absolutely delicious. For all these reasons it‚Äôs our regular lunch place. The only thing we could have wished for was a booth upstairs, out of the sports bar atmosphere, but alas still not open for lunch.",3
Everything was great except for the coffee which was very weak,3
"Friend‚Äôs Birthday.  Service was friendly & accommodating.  Lots of steak to choose from, but my fish eating friends were very happy with their halibut.",3
"Excellent Sunday brunch, quality food, lovely service. We will certainly be back",4
"The Miller Tavern was a cozy choice for lunch on a cold February day.  The dinning room is very warm and welcoming with lots of wood.  I could do without the visual distraction of all the TV screens.  We were dining with a friend with mobility issues and the staff where great about placing in a table rather than a booth.  The service was friendly and efficient.  When we arrived, we did sit for awhile before the server came to take drink orders.  From then on the service went very smoothly.  Three of five of us ordered the classic steak with peppercorn sauce which was done very well.  Both the sweet potato and regular fries were fantastic.",3
Waiter and waitress are very friendly. The foods are excellent including desserts.,4
"Valentines day dinner for 3 couples. Hard to believe they were sold out of oysters before 7pm. The place was 2/3 empty, and to be honest we were only going there for the oysters.",2
"We‚Äôve been going for years. Food, service and atmosphere have always been second to none.",4
"love this place, our family goes 2-3 times a month :)",4
"Went for an early afternoon Happy Hour
Great snacks
Good ambience and the time we went was not too noisy
Great Happy Hour fins",3
Excellent on all counts - our waiter was spectacular,4
"Sort of a Valentine night for the family.

Our server, Carly was fantastic!
Friendly and attentive.
She took initiative, and was very accommodating.",3
"Very nice place for friends and family gatherings! There are varieties of choices among steaks and seafood, flavored Italian, American and Thaifood even! Strongly recommended!",4
"A vastly different experience from the time I spent there in the 60s
A very good evening one we would repeat and certainly recommend to all
Bethany was a pleasant helpful professional",4
Empty restaurant and we waited for our table for a bit.,4
Great service and food. Craig is amazing!!!,4
Great restaurant and fantastic food and service! One of the best restaurants I‚Äôve ever been too for casual dining!,4
Great service.,3
Trudy was absolutely terrific! Thanks Trudy.,4
Good ambiance and perfect for Sat night out with friends. My husbands $45 steak had lots of tendons and rather tough. Noted this to server who compted a free dessert- very thoughtful.  Friend wanted a simple chicken dish and nothing like this on the menu -- very strange - only had Jerk chicken - sad knowing that a lot of people tend to avoid red meat.  She also cannot eat shellfish so got some appetizers instead.,3
"We really enjoyed our evening & Alana made it extra special, she very sweet and professional. 
I did notice the decor & some new flowers. It‚Äôs nice to see the effort being made. 
Try branches in water for the spring. They will keep for quite a while, looking fresh but very spring like as they bloom. 
See you soon 
I forgot to use my discount ticket. 
Jacqueline de Vries.",4
"Booked in advance but table in bar section, south side. Very cold and many customers near us also complaining.",1
"Excellent service, delicious food, fine selections of both menu foods and beverages, respectful and classy staff members, enjoyable music selections and perfect setting for a date night with a special someone or sharing a good time with friends and family!

Thank you to all at The Miller Tavern!
Daniel",4
"Excellent venue, service, food.  One issue is the parking lot capacity.",4
Great food . Had seafood angel hair pasta.  It was delicious!! Would highly recommend,4
The steak was too salty and the place is not recommended for young demographic! Not a Vibrant ambiance!,1
"Our server didn‚Äôt properly take our order. The steak served was cold and not cooked to specification even after it was brought back. 

The steak actually looked like dog food.",1
"This was our poorest visit to the Miller.  We had invited friends from Burlington for dinner and when we got there we found that you had closed the upper level for repairs.  The noise level in the sports bar was extremely high and we had difficulty hearing each other.  If you are going to do things like that, then p;ease state that on your website.

The food was very good and if we decide to come back again, I will phone ahead and make sure that we are seated in the upstairs part of the restaurant.",1
"Just disappointed, I was told this place was great at steaks but, my breakfast steak was not good. No flavor and the sauteed onions did not taste fresh. The bread basket was good and the service was good but food just wasn't good for me.",2
First time here and we will be back. We were out to celebrate my daughter's birthday and it was great (other than it being a bit cold in the restaurant ) I had the primerib roast beef. It was cooked perfectly. So tender and a very generous portion. My daughter had steak and again cooked to perfection.  The sticky toffee pudding is delicious,4
Excellent quality of food and service. The atmosphere and view were great. The washroom was clean and had proper lighting. Miller Tavern remains one of my favourite place to dine. The online reservation service was easy to use.,4
"We made a reservation online and requested the upstairs dining room with the view. They were very professional and alerted us it was closed and offered to cancel or make room for us in the lounge. 

We were shown to our table on arrival and made very comfortable by the young man acting as host. The room was warm and not as noisy as we expected from a lounge with TV. 

We all chose different meals. I had the peppercorn steak. It was not the best quality steak but the price was appropriate and it was very tasty. The Pad Thai was not a winner. But the Salmon and Cod were excellent and a good portion size.


We found the Pinot Gris from from Masi was excellent but priced a little high. Indeed we found the whole wine list a little over market. 

In summary, we had a lovely evening with great service and adequate food. In the summer the patio and the windowed upstairs seemed to make everything better.",3
"We continued our annual New Year‚Äôs Eve tradition of dinner at Millers and were disappointed this year. Typically, they serve a complimentary amuse bouche or after dinner beverage. This year prices increased and nothing was complimentary or special to acknowledge the holiday. The food was good. 

The main dining room upstairs was extremely loud and we could barely hear one another across the table. The restaurant had a number of infants and children under 10 years old running around and screaming. When your going out to celebrate a special evening and spending $$$$ I don‚Äôt want to hear other people‚Äôs undisciplined children. Had I known we would have sat downstairs in the causal bar area which was peaceful.",2
"The calamari was amazing but the main courses (both dishes) were not satisfactory and over priced ++
The special Roasted Lobster was overcooked, the rice was cold and possibly came from a box, the asparagus was cold and woody. The Pad Thai was lacking in seafood, poor taste, and served warm not hot. I am not the type of person to make a fuss and complain as it was supposed to be a special new years eve dinner. I have been there quite a bit over the years and have never been so disappointed. I will most likely never return there.

However, your booking service is great and I will use it in the future.",1
"Meh, needs a renovation badly!!! The food was mediocre and not commensurate with the pricing.",1
"Winter menu very limited for vegetarians. Otherwise, excellent service and ambiance.",3
Perfect place to hangout with friends. Quality food and nice setting,4
"Service was unbelievably slow and inconsistent. You pay enough at Miller Tavern that you expect a good experience, and this was not that. Food was average, steak cooked very poorly, service was terrible. Overall just a really bad experience.",1
Forgot to mention. Lights out in bathroom,4
"The service from bar / Kitchen & wait staff were below par - very slow / had to ask for everything / food forgotten. And it was not a busy night so no excuse.
Nice space - the rest was disappointing",1
"As usual we feel at home at The Miller, so it‚Äôs always a good experience. 
I believe I‚Äôve mentioned the bathrooms. They are not well kept. I have a friend that was there last week, she hasn‚Äôt been there in quite a while. She said the bathroom downstairs was messy with things broken. She also said she won‚Äôt return. My experience in the upstairs washroom; is that it‚Äôs always messy. I realize some ‚Äúladies‚Äù lack etiquette & make no effort to leave things presentable for the next guest. 
I certainly do love all the Christmas decor. Well done! 
The food is usual never a disappointment. 
The service is great, but we know everyone. Well done considering the busy Christmas season.",3
Monica gave us excellent service despite the busy time.  Food was good but noise level very high!,3
Great lunch this week at Miller Tavern. The only issue was driving around for 40 minutes unable to park and ending up at the TTC station and walking quite a long way in the cold.,3
Excellent service and table location.  Good food and enjoyable lunch.,4
No parking. Drama to find a spot. Waiters are cranky.,2
"The food there was awesome, particularly the seafood hair pasta we tried several times, it is strongly recommended!",4
"They did not have our selection available right off the menu, this was at lunch time. Our waitress was great.",2
"We went for Brunch and the servings were VERY generous and the food was good.  No one left hungry. 

The curious part was that Open Table showed the restaurant was booked up; but when arrived, there appeared to be SEVERAL tables available.  The service was not exceptional.  It took several minutes for the server to approach us to take our orders and it was NOT overly busy.",2
"Our meal was good until it was time to pay the cheque.
The server was rushing around and instead of giving us three separate bills, she divided the bill by three.
When we tried to tell her, she looked really irritated and pretended like she didn't understand what we were asking. Then we noticed they defaulted their lowest tip rate to 18% on the credit card machine- bit cheeky, I'd say! It's the first time I had such bad service at this restaurant.",2
"Great food, service and atmosphere. Would recommend it to friends",4
Prompt attentive service and well presented as well prepared food,3
Nice restaurant but in busy hours too noisy and hard to find a parking lot,4
The waiter was very poor. Missed taking everyone‚Äôs drink order. Very inattentive & aloof. Paid no attention to our table and it was not busy.,0
Service was not as good as I expected from previous experience.,3
"Birthday lunch with friends, most enjoyable with lovely carrot cake for dessert, thank you. Patricia Keegan",3
"I was surprised to see that I only got a steak, and mashed potatoes and didn't know I had to order vegetables separately.  Other ""places"" will give saut√©ed green/red peppers on the plate for example.  Ordered bread basket with regular and maple butter and only got maple butter. 
the steak was very dry and my plate felt naked and I didn't want to keep asking for things. Steak was cooked perfectly, mashed potatoes were lumpy. 
guess I expected more as I have been there so many times and this was the first time I was truly disappointed.  Even my wine glass had less in it than my two friends'.  I will come there only as a group when it is a business gathering only in the future.",1
Service was prompt and attentive food was of good quality... a bit pricey,3
"We arrived right on time for our 6:30  reservation and were taken upstairs to our table. Our table was in a corner to the left of the stairs. All the other booths in this area were empty at this point. It became apparent that we had been given the second worst booth in that area as it was close to a door which led out to a patio. During our dinner, the door opened and closed many times as the waiters had to pass through it in order to serve the guests on the patio. As a result we had to suffer periodic drafts. No one was ever seated in the booth next to the door. I feel that we should have been given a booth away from the drafty door since many were available when we arrived.
My husband had the wild salmon which he said was pretty tasteless accompanied by rice and a very small portion of beans. My chicken pot pie with house salad was good and hot. Espresso was good. In general we did not think the quality of the food matched the price.",1
"Five MBAs reunited, some for the first time in 53 years! Great food. The Cobb salad was a hit with 3 who had never experienced it before. The Buddha Bowl salad I had was interesting and delicious. The fifth at the far end of the table had tortilla chips and dip, which looked attractive, but I didn't ask for or get any feedback rating. We spent two unrushed hours on a Tuesday, which was just fine with us! Planning to make it an annual event.",4
"We are so disappointed in food and service. Our server was not a professional and got everything wrong such as wrong food for higher price, forgot the desert forks, and argued about all her mistakes. I gave her a tip only because we are close to xmas but we will never go back.",0
As usual we lived our experience! I love the staff we feel at home when we‚Äôre at the Miller.,4
The meal was superb. !!!,4
"Very good place for celebrate. Free parking on premieres on Yonge Street. Fresh food and good drinks.
Overall ""Excellent""",4
was on a business dinner - first time for all 3 of us - food was not the greatest - sea food entrees were on par with red lobster (should have been much better),1
Peter our waiter was very attentive!,4
Going away party for work colleague.,3
"Awesome server, food was good. Went for our anniversary.  Son was in from university as well.",3
Ordered Medium rare Steak and got medium well. Felt little overpriced for the quality of food we received. However place presents warm atmosphere as well as has access to nice park right outside. Server was not overly attentive and food took bit long given than the place was about 1/5 full.,2
"It has been a few years, since we were at the miller, but this time the food was not good for the price point
the serve was good, the location in the restaurant was great for our party of 6, but with the disappointment
of the food, espically at the high price point put us in a position of not returning soon, and with limited recommendation to others.
Disappointed customer.
Bill W",2
"We had a very enjoyable evening UPSTAIRS at the Miller Tavern where it is nice and quiet and easy to hold a conversation.  Howie our waiter was wonderful.  

The menu is the same both upstairs and downstairs but it is much noisier downstairs - more of a bar with TVs all around the room.  The downstairs area has a happy hour.

Not inexpensive but very good food and service.",4
"My burger was to have caramelized onions but I got fresh uncooked ones instead. Also salad needs more dressing  and ketchup was only brought to the table for the burger, mustard, mayo, relish was not served. 18% tip is getting to be too much of an add on which means we dine out less.",3
"The ambiance was great, service was very good and the steaks were good too .",4
Awful.  Going down hill .....,0
"Great food. Good service. Will
Return",4
Service was very good. Caesar Salad was good.  My steak was disappointing...not hot and very chewy. The presentation was not appetizing. Won‚Äôt order steaks again at this restaurant!,3
We had an excellent dinner to celebrate a birthday. The service was great and adjusted to out our pace. The food was well prepared and presented. It was a very enjoyable visit overall.,4
"Food: I love the new menu. A little more vegan and or vegetarian would be a become. 
Decor: I just think the flowers are horrible. As a designer, I notice these things. It doesn‚Äôt have to cost a lot.  Just get creative, cut a few branches. 
Service: it‚Äôs always excellent!",4
Service was excellent .. Howie is the best !!!  The bartender was fantastic as well though I did not catch her name. It was a birthday and they treated the birthday girl in such a special way! So happy with the Miller!!!,4
Good value ...good good....will visit again next time in that part of Toronto....,3
Host and server did not communicate so husband never got his cake with a candle as requested in writing or in person. Steak was rare instead of medium and had to be sent back. Had to move tables. Far too close to a large group. Server was charming and graciously tried to make up for everything but there were just so many things that went wrong on a night we wanted to be special. Had my wedding rehearsal dinner there and had a far better experience. Wouldn‚Äôt go back again though. This time was very was disappointing.,1
"I've been to Miler Tavern quite a few times. Great wine selection for happy hour. Overall, food is usually excellent but this time, the nachos arrived with warm toppings like cheese and meat cold and dried out . Service was very good. And washrooms were clean and well stocked with paper towels!",3
"We didn't order appetizers as we decided to have a main meal and dessert, however, we were surprised delighted to be served Amuse Bouche -- a little tasting of guacamole that certainly whet our appetites -- beautifully presented and absolutely yummy.  Unexpected and most welcome! 
The chicken penne was delicious - in a creamy sauce with asiago cheese and pommery mustard, and the roast beef on a bun with fries was also very good.
We did save the best for last -- dessert was superb -- creme caramel for two of us and the salted caramel/popcorn/chocolate/toffee dessert for one of us.  The desserts were awesome.",4
"Our waiter Howie made my birthday lunch a very fun and memorable occasion. With his generous surprises, wine quiz, pairing knowledge and humour, he made us want to return soon. I will make sure I sit in his section always! Thank you Howie for a magic birthday lunch experience.",4
"My friend and I went for Brunch as we've been there before and enjoyed it. It's also  in our neighbouhood. Our meal was delicious and our server was, at first attentive. However, a large group arrived and sat close to us at which time she was more attentive to them! I waited a long time to get her attention to request more coffee. I must say that the Hostess was very engaging and professional. Thank you.",3
"The Miller menu has so many interesting options it is always a challenge to choose just one. 
I often order one of the Starter items along with soup or a salad for a more than adequate meal. The Dim Sum basket or the This and That platter are interesting and filling. 
The halibut, which is one of the most expensive items on the menu, is worth it. The steak options are varied, interesting and have always been perfectly-prepared. The items all have unique and flavourful components. The beer and wine selection is extensive. Maybe more rose options would help. 
Service is usually very friendly and professional. Downstairs with TVs and the bar can be noisy. Upstairs is quieter and the booths are comfortable.",3
The fish and child was not very good.  The fish was mediocre.  The service was good.,3
"Celebrating 40 anniversary
Good place, good menu, friendly staff",4
Enjoyed our dinner in the patio with the beautiful Autumn leaves behind us.,4
"Good local spot that draws people from afar as well. Good fir medium sized groups and smaller parties .

Good and varied wine selection at reasonable prices and whether beef fish or veggie is your choice - alit if choice",3
"Excellent food, fabulous service. We had asked for a table downstairs because one of our party is elderly and avoiding stairs makes things easier. It was chilly and a bit noisy downstairs so we asked to move upstairs, and even though we were a party of 10 they accommodated right away. It was perfect upstairs, and service and food did not disappoint.  We were celebrating a 90th birthday, which had been shared when the reservation was made, and they surprised us with a special dessert and drinks for all which was on the house. This was not requested or expected,  it was much appreciated! We will return.",4
Prompt attentive service - quiet enough for conversation and good ambiance for business meetings,3
"Unfortunately the shared cesar salad arrived in one bowl, which would have been fine except that I could see the brown edges on the romaine lettuce.  The filets were cooked very nicely, but would have appreciated the chance to order a smaller cut (6 or 7 oz instead of 8).  Sweet potato fries were coated in something crunchy and not to my liking.",2
We were lucky enough to sit on the patio (heated) and get to see the colours of the changing leaves at the nearby trees. The food was tasty and the portions were generous. Our waiter wasn't amazing but managed to get the orders right.,3
Wedding anniversary. Service was amazing and the food was great as always. They even brought out two glasses of bubbly for us!,4
"I felt the Miller Tavern was a good spot for our birthday celebration.  I was slightly bothered by infrequent service visits, but this was made up for by the pleasant server and celebrating the birthday with a piece of cheesecake.  Many of us ordered steak and we were all impressed by the quality and flavour of the dish.",3
"We decided to go to the Miller to celebrate our anniversary.  Jeff was our server and he was outstanding.  Attentive, there when you needed him and he brought us a dessert in honour of our anniversary.  The food was good - one of the best steaks I have had for the price point.  We had brought our own wine  and the corkage was only $20.  Definitely will return.  Made for a lovely anniversary dinner",3
Good food as always.,3
Lower floor a bit cellarish. Next time I would ask for upper floor dining area. Otherwise a great dining experience with delightful service and excellent food.,3
Would have liked a few more pub type meal- what I had was okay and everyone in my group loved their food.,4
"Everything was average, nothing special. I was my first time at this location and it was not what I expected. Food was good, drinks acceptable. The personnel was a little bit lost, it seemed they were new. They did not know what cocktails they can offer. Dessert was good. Our table was on the terrace, it was too tight, I would recommend a table inside . It is also noisy. And pricey. Good for going out Friday night with your friends. Not for a special occasion.",2
Service was mediocre. Two entrees were not cooked to specifications. The other two entrees were perfect.  Mixed feelings about coming back,2
"We,  a group of 4 arrived for our 7pm reservation, seated promptly, then it went downhill.  Our server came after about 20 minutes for our drink order.  Came back with drinks and water and was not seen again  for half hour to 35 minutes.  She took out orders and never refilled our water, never asked if we wanted more drinks and never asked if we wanted any wine.  Our meals of prime rib arrived at 9pm,  cold to the touch, Yorkshire had a horrific metallic taste. We were starving so we started to eat and trying to flag down our server  but not to be seen.  We finally caught the attention of someone else and expressed our disappointment in our meals.   The manager was then dispatched, by now it was 930pm.  He came and we explained all to him how truly disappointed we were in the meal and service.  He offered to comp our meal and he took  our dessert order. Dessert was brought by yet another person, we haven't seen our initial waitress since around 8pm.   She came around 1030 to ask if we needed any thing else.  I will never refer anyone to this place,   bad meal  and horrible service.   It would take a lot of begging to get me back to give them another chance!",0
my salad was small and disappointing. Other than that we had a good time,1
"Server was superb
Was disappointed the upstairs was not open in Sunday",3
"Had a two-year anniversary lunch and the staff were excellent, the appetizers and sides perfect, as were special touches (thank you The Miller, for the complimentary fruit-and-chocolate sauce on the occasion of our anniversary). Only complaint was that our two steaks (different cuts) were rare, whereas we ordered medium. No big deal. Unless it's a bona fide steakhouse, just about every good restaurant in TO has a chef who wants to singe the meat on both sides, and call it medium. Just remember to order 'medium-well' if you are at The Miller - and I hope you check them out - to get something between rare and burnt.",3
The calamari was excellent. Service was good. We sat outside and there were flies around so it was less enjoyable for us.,2
"We booked the  Miller Tavern to celebrate my daughter's birthday. I wish we had gone to The Keg instead. One of the steaks was over cooked and one order of the prime rib was very poor quality compared to another order of the same dish. The manager tried to make it right by redoing both of the meals and comping them . But that meant that while everyone else was eating, two of our guests had to wait for the meals. He also comped our entire party with dessert which was very nice. But overall we were very disappointed. The service could have been a bit quicker. The acoustics where we sat upstairs was very noisy and made it impossible to hear someone from across the table. The other meals were tasty but very over priced for what we got. And no vegetables with the steak and frites! 
Sorry but we will not be returning to The Miller.",1
"i like the miller but ireally liked upstairs.i use a walker and there is no elevator.

also next to us was a very LOUD group and it was hard to hear .",3
"Our server Jeffery had a great sense of humour and was absolutely a pleasure to deal with.  We had dinner there as it was my Wife's Birthday and he knew that and acknowledged it, which was really nice.  My Wife and I met at the Jolly Miller Tavern 39 years ago and had not been there since it reopened as a restaurant.  We were both very impressed with the Restaurant as it is now as the Miller Tavern.

We will definitely be returning to the Miller Tavern now that we have rediscovered it.

Thanks again to Jeffery and if all the staff are this friendly and helpful the Miller Tavern should very happy.",4
Always great food !  Great ambience.  Could turn down the music a bit for conversations,4
"Was looking forward to having dinner on the patio and enjoy the last long weekend of summer. When we arrived the patio was closed and we had to eat inside. This is the second long weekend this summer that we went to Millers and the patio was closed it appears that management doesn‚Äôt schedule staff coverage appropriately. Highly disappointing. I would have left to go to another restaurant, but it‚Äôs difficult on a Saturday night without reservations. So, we stayed. The food was fine. Service was slow due to lack of staff.",2
If you can get the patio do so as it is very lovely !!!,2
"We waited 45 minutes for our entrees. Steaks were cold and dry, I had to order peppercorn sauce to give it flavour.  Who doesn't serve veggies with their entrees?? Steaks were definitely not worth the $47 price.",1
"I really enjoy the ambience at the Miller, meet with friends, there was good energy of people, servers were pleasant and more than a few times food has gotten better, fun place to be within our community.",3
"We love going to the patio of Miller Tavern, this time we had an event and were seated inside downstairs. The air conditioning was on full blast we all froze during our dinner, maybe management can adjust that? Server said he couldn‚Äôt. Food was delicious as usual and good portions. The server was a little lost with taking orders, guess we were just too much to handle. Thanks, will visit again.",2
"Very pleasant spot, outdoor seating was excellent.  The service was efficient and friendly. We wished the food in general had been better. There were some really tasty dishes but overall we were not particularly impressed, seafood dishes in particular needed help!",3
I wasn:t expecting dry frozen french fries with my steak frites. Plus the steak was overcooked. If you're going to call it steak frites you have to make sure the fries are fresh cut and enjoyable to eat.,2
"Meh, meh, meh, meh, meh - I have to use my 50 characters!",1
First off the service was very good as was the ambience.  The food however was medicore at best subsequently poor value.  Disappointing I would be hesitant to return.,1
Convenient and private setting to conduct a business meeting.,3
"A reservation was made & ""anniversary"" indicated while doing so. No acknowledgement of that during dinner.  Upon arriving we went inside & met a very friendly & smiling hostess at the door. After discussion about where we would like to sit, we were directed to the outside patio area where we met a non smiling hostess. She directed us to sit anywhere. After finding a table we waited for over ten minutes for a waiter to finally acknowledge that we were there & bring menus. Although there was an apology for ""taking so long"" we weren't even asked if we would like a drink before he walked away. He returned about ten minutes later to finally take our drink order. In that time span we observed another gentleman walk from his table & cut off the waiter asking ""can we at least get our wine & some bread?"", obviously not happy with the service. Finally our drinks came & then it was waiting time for the food. It was probably at least forty minutes from the time we arrived to getting an appetizer on the table. The entr√©es came in a timely manner after the appetizers. Although we enjoyed our food, the prices seemed rather high for simple curry with chicken or a couple of tacos, but then again I'm sure the overhead for the tavern demands these kind of prices. My first visit to to tavern was over forty years ago & have been there a few times with my wife. We find each time we go the service gets worse. Usually we don't bother with reviews, but this visit has left us wondering if we will ever return.",2
"I had an impromptu dinner date with my daughter - the kid's menu had a great selection of items and was very reasonably priced!  Our server was fantastic, and very pleasant.  We shared a Buffalo Mozzarella salad to start with and it was DELICIOUS!  would have been amazing to have 4 instead of 3 pieces of cheese.  My ""Buddha Bowl"" salad was delicious as well, and my daughter loved her Burger from the kid's menu!  The tomato vegetable soup was a little disappointing only because it was more of a tomato onion soup versus a tomato soup with some veggies in it.  The server was very gracious in allowing her to exchange it for a different side dish, without question. Much appreciated!  We will definitely be back!",4
An excellent experience for date night. The ribeye and curry bowls were awesome. The server knew the food and was able to assist with our allergy issues. Definitely a repeat date night and or group event.,4
My absolute fav lunch spot. Service is incredible and their seafood salad platter must be tried!!,4
Very enjoyable evening. My Roast beef was a bit underdone but still good.,3
"Great location, customer service and food was excellent. Price is a little pricey but we don‚Äôt have to worry to find a parking, so it‚Äôs balance it out.
Customer service is always excellent!",3
Loved the patio! Hard to believe you are right at Yonge street,3
"We often go here. Service is generally great and food quite good. I would consider it a bit pricy for a bar but...it is better than most bars!!
It is very predictable.",3
Say at the patio and enjoyed wine and dinner with friends. Had a cozy table and enjoyed the weather,3
"Been a go-to for a while. Never a bad experience. Good food, good selection of wine and liquor",3
Great patio! Cocktails were delicious and food was very well presented. Service was good without being rushed. Highly recommend for lunch or dinner.,3
Went to the Miller for my parent's 40th anniversary.  Had a fantastic time with great service and a delicious meal.,4
"Brunch was great! Disappointed in the dessert (chocolate cake) as it tasted ""stale"".",4
The service was excellent and the food was delicious. My only criticism was that I didn‚Äôt care for their sangria. But that can be chalked up to preference.,4
"We love the Miller we are regulars, love the staff, food, ambiance thank you üíï 
Just one thing .... the garden is  homely. I‚Äôm a designer, it doesn‚Äôt cost must to make it look good!",4
"Great spot and view.  Food was delicious.  There for a girls night and we went for a walk after, really nice evening.",4
"Food was delicious but portions are small.
Unfortunately it was raining when we arrived so we could not sit outside on the beautiful patio with a happy hour üçª",3
Good variety in their menu and service.  Love their Happy Hour.,3
"John's 82nd birthday.
Loved chocolate fondue with fruit instead of cake. 
Great seafood platter .
Excellent occasion.  
Many seating choices, inside, verandah and patio.   
Great service, waiter with quiet sense of humour.",4
nice staff! Accommodating for our needs by serving the dessert at a time requested and prepared the birthday cake for the girl!,3
"We really like the Miller but tonight we were quite disappointed.  We had a large party and two of us ordered steaks. The medium rare steak came out medium well and the medium well cane out blue. We returned the under cook steak twice ‚Äì and both times they cook it again.  By the third time it was extremely well done and a piece of it was missing.  It was shocking to us that the third time we didn‚Äôt get a new steak, or an apology or an adjustment to the bill.

Steakhouses should know how to cook steak",2
Great food and brought us a complimentary chocolate cake out of nowhere. It was wonderful would absolutley go again,4
"Lax service initially...while waiting for my guest, Server was brusque and didn't even offer water.  I had to request it from bus attendant who was very obliging.  Generous wholesome portions of fish and chicken.  At the end of our meal, Server was friendly (wanted a good tip??), proferred a shot of Royal Mead dessert wine to top off the meal, sat down and chatted.",3
"Great experience.  Awesome bartender, Jody.  Great service, made the experience memorable",4
Food and service were both very good. Patio felt very separate from outside world and was nicely shaded.  Parking was the only challenge as restaurant and pay lot right next door  were both full which meant it was necessary to park a distance away. Usually when restaurant lot is full there is space in next door lot so this may have been just a unusual day.,4
Our lunch was great - fresh and yummy! We'd go back again for sure!,4
Very pleasant waitress.  My nephew has chosen the Miller as a location for me to take him for a birthday lunch several years in a row so that speaks to its desirability as a very good location.  This year I indicated when I reserved that it was for his birthday and he was delighted with the gratis slice of delicious chocolate cake.  Thank you.,3
We had a very nice dinner at Miller Tavern. The view is excellent and the buddha bowl was very good!,3
"Have been hosting occasional business meetings and friend get-together for a number of years. The group always enjoys the great food, presented attractively, the service was very professional. The right mix of attention and standoffishness and ambience. Some come via the nearby subway and others drive.  Loved it! Thanks!",4
"Really nice restaurant and patio.  Upscale outdoor dining.  A little pricey but worth it!
Would love pillows on the metal chair backs.  We asked for a pillow and they gave us one.
Food was pretty good and nice wine choices.  Vodka Martini a bit pricey at $11 each.
Loved the ambience!",3
Great experience. Happy hour from 2-6pm is a great deal. Awesome patio,4
"Great food, good service.  Only thing I would say is the plate lacked presentation.",3
"The first floor is quite dark and more pub like than other areas, so I only gave this a 3 based on the first floor. We had to move to be closer to a window to see our food better. The meals were delicious and the steak was so tasty that I would go back in a heartbeat for more of that succulent and perfectly grilled steak. The lobster tail portion of my surf and turf was done perfectly and drowned in butter, so I really enjoyed that. Overall, we liked the food enough to go back no matter what.",3
The experience in this restaurant was tainted by the fact that they didn‚Äôt have a changing table in neither bathroom.,3
The service was incredible. Food was very good. The serving staff had our table down pat. They knew when to come to our table and when to leave us alone. We also sat chatting for so long that we ordered desserts and coffee after we had paid our bill,3
The restaurant overcharged my co-diner for a large rather side Caesar salad and also charged $2.25 for aioli to use to dip the sweet potato fries. The service was slow and sporadic even though the restaurant seemed relatively empty and not busy.,0
"We were sitted in the balcony, which was wonderful & very spacious.
We started off with the dim sum basket as our appetizer. It was scrumptious & would love they would make a main
I had the spicy shrimp tacos & must say it was very light on the spice!
The service was wonderful & would highly recommend the Miller tavern for any occasion",3
First time there waitress was great food was also very good.,4
"Sat outside.  Both had the Tuna  Poke .  Very good but a little pricey.
Accommodating wait staff.",3
Their Visa machine was not working properly and they ended up billing my twice. I am still waiting for the refund.,1
"The waiter was great, whatever he suggest for appetizer and main course was great, very friendly, as soon as he find out the occasion got the birthday he brought a cake for the birthday lady. 
The food and drink was delicious.",4
Best thing about the restaurant is the patio. Never go during the winter months. Wine is very over priced. Food was pretty good.,4
had an issue with vegetable patty being cold.  they warmed it up but it got soggy.  otherwise it was fine.  beautiful patio.,3
"We went for a Bday & Father's Day and the service was wonderful! Friendly, fast and attentive. We all enjoyed the food as well.

It was our first time there, but we would definitely go back.",4
Sitting outside was nice (inside is very dark and stoic.).  Service was great.   Food was below average quality and quite expensive.   I would go again for a drink with a friend if it was a nice patio day but will not go again to eat.,2
"Went for monther‚Äôs day brunch, table was not set and still have dirty glasses from previous service.",2
"We haven't been as happy the last couple of times that we ate there. We were there Saturday with friends.  We asked for bread with our meal. They told us it would be 4.50 extra. ( Most places offer it to you). We said no problem. We never did get the bread. Presentation of some appetizers like the ""some this some that"". Looked really skimpy.  The food was just ok.  Not sure what happened, or maybe new management. Not in a rush to go back. Unfortunately since it is close by and great patio.",2
The food was pretty good. Nothing wonderful. The calamari and the tuna poke were probably our favourites. I found the service to be a little slow. We weren‚Äôt in a rush so it was ok. One of our dishes was mistakenly given to another table. We had to wait longer for our dish to come. I feel like we should have been compensated for that.,3
Good food. Excellent service.   Wish they had more broad appetizer options.,4
"I'd been in this place few times and love the ambiance, great food and excellent customer service.
The only comment I have is the cushion outside in the sitting area is uncomfortable. Maybe it's time to change the cushion.
Overall it's a great restaurant.",4
Im a return customer and have been coming here for many years.  This particular reservation was for my daughter's graduation celebration and when I made the reservation I did specify that we were celebrating.  I did not specify that I wanted a table upstairs but I was very dissapponted when we were seated downstairs in the lounge.  I found it dark and uninviting for a special lunch and it made it a completely different dining outing from what I was hoping.  I should of asked when we arrived to move us upstairs but I didnt so I am part to blame.  For the amount of money spent on our meal and the fact that we did specify that it was a Celebration - I feel that a little more care could of been into giving us a brighter and nicer table upstairs.   The food is always excellant but the ambiance in the lounge was definately not worth the money we paid for our meal.,2
"Not the place it used to be! I remember amuse bouche between appetizer and entree, 6 week aged in house tenderloin, instead $8 bottle of san Pellegrino, $15 buffalo mozzarella single serving. When asked if it came with bread, waiter wanted to charge us.  Steak was stringy and not the best quality for the price. Maybe a steak for the pickle barrel not the miller. Not the value it used, will think twice before returning.",2
"Great, vareied menu.  Something for everyone h",4
They always provide an excellent experience for friends and family.,4
"Service was superb; the young woman was very affable and polite.  Cuisine innovative, wholesome and flavourful.  Outdoor patio was lovely - just heard din from Yonge St., but greenery and birds added a lovely ambience.  The patio umbrella over our table was dismantled by 2 servers and dirt/debris fell into my plate and onto my clothes.  They should have asked us to move beforehand.",4
Have been to the Miller many times and it never disappoints.  That's why I keep coming back.,3
"Service quite good and staff attentive.
Had prime rib and tuna dish. Both very tasty.
Price is reasonable for the area.
Good ambience for two or  twenty",3
Loved the patio!,4
"The lovely young woman who hosted the patio during our lunch was superb! Not well served by the male server who couldn‚Äôt seem to serve properly - placing plates as far as possible from guests instead o moving a glass that seemed to hamper his ability to serve, not placing the correct meal at the correct people (despite the fact that 2 of the three meals were the same so a ‚Öî chance of getting it right). And this was the same poor service as the day before bybthe same young man.  Fortunately the female host more than made up for it!",3
One of the best patios around and the food is great. Perfect place to go if you're not in the mood for downtown restaurants.,4
Great food and service,4
Good food though a bit pricey.  Good for a special occasion. Wait staff was great!  Did have to switch tables as we were on balcony above where smokers go to smoke so was cigarette smoke was wafting up over the  table.  Good once we switched to a table not on that side.,3
"great service,we had pepper steaks ,done to perfection",4
We enjoyed our evening at the Miller Tavern. The food was good and the opportunity to sit on the veranda really added to the ambiance. The dinner was a business meeting and we were able to enjoy good food and venue over good business conversation.,4
I'm jaded by my experiences at the Miller Tavern (Bay Street near the ACC).  The food there is exceptional.   I was expecting the same quality and quantity.  I ordered a favourite menu item at the York Mills location (Cobb salad).  Much smaller portions.  Different ingredients.  I was disappointed.,2
The food is pricey and the portions are small but our server was great.,2
It was nice to see the garden with some herbs  now a few flowers would be  nice,3
"Birthday lunch with my girlfriend .  They brought us out a lovely piece of chocolate cake , free , for dessert .  I thought that was a very
Nice touch .  Thank- you!!",3
"We took my sister in law out for dinner for her birthday and we were terribly disappointed in the service and the food.
We will not go back to the Miller again.",0
Great lunch! The outdoor patio is a nice spot and the food and service were both quite good...,3
We had the Seafood Salad Platter. It was delicious and attractively plated. Would definitely order it again. Service was super.,4
"The steak menu is good but the value is not there 
The desert is not great 
The banana caramel crunch was pop corn with caramel sauce and a few slices of banana
It is a horrible dessert please remove it",3
Excellent food and service.,4
Mothers Day - table of 5 food came out together (slight wait) cooked wonderfully and presented well. Servers were very professional but sometimes scarce. Overall everyone was happy with main course and desserts and enjoyed by all!,3
"We went there for Mothers Day, it was incredible.  Peter was our server and he was just so delightful.  The bartender Jody ( Jodi ) came over and said hello also, he was very nice as well.  The staff were so friendly and the service was outstanding.  The food was also very tasty, we had  Steak and Lobster and a Peppercorn Steak, the desert was this caramel banana dish that was very interesting but tasty.  All and All a great experience.",4
Very good steak. Considering the price the restaurant could have been offered some bread and butter complementary. Or else very very nice place ambiance terrace.. will go again!!,4
"Been many times . Never disappoints . Great outdoor patio . Some great tables but not going to mention which . I don‚Äôt need competition since no reservation for our door patio . Like place a lot . Friendly , in the ‚Äú‚Äòhood‚Äù . Great find if you haven‚Äôt been there yet .",4
"The Miler Tavern serves a very nice brunch with lots of options, including a kids brunch menu.",3
"We live closeby and never tried until now. Steak is excellent, plus other goodies on the menu - tried the Hawaiian Tuna Poke and the This and That combo, both delicious. We'll come back again for our next date night.",4
"The food was okay, but it definitely wasn't worth the price. Normally I can order a steak and be so full that I don't want anything else to eat for a while. I had the steak here and I was still really hungry. The cost for these meals didn't match the food you were given. I can get a steak the same size at a place like the Keg, pay less, and be extremely satisfied with my meal. I'm glad I experienced it because I was wondering about it for a while. Now I know and will probably not go back there.",2
"Food and service fine.
Noise level painful. Noisy diners watching hockey on TV. 
I guess we should have eaten upstairs. Hopefully there are no TVs there. 
Hostess should have warned us.",2
Excellent service by Craig. Great variety of food and tasty.,4
"Used to be a great place 10 yrs ago. Has fallen so far. Riding its historical rep. My son‚Äôs chicken fingers were door stops, my seafood pad thai ($31) was like chef boy Ardie. Waiter had a 3 word vocabulary.  Burger was very okay. Bright light was the Indian dish was awesome and my daughters pasta and veggies were good.  In closing food was Kelsey‚Äôs level but Bay Street pricing.  Need to keep up with the location and the historical reputation. Service made you feel like u were at a busy dim sum resto on a Sunday morning...",1
The Miller offers a varied menu of tasty offerings. The porch upstairs is a lovely setting for lunch and lovely on a sunny day. It is one of my favourites for a business lunch.,3
"I ordered the Special Surf and Turf.  Delicious cut of beef and nice portion of lobster tail, but no sauce on either protein.  Put a chimichurri or something which would go with both.  I asked for steak sauce for the beef, but there was nothing for the lobster tail.  Otherwise, all good.",3
"Howie was our waiter and he was fantastic! He provided us with amazing service all night and really made our anniversary special. Would come back for several reasons; the food is always delicious, service is always friendly and the overall night is always great at the Miller Tavern!",4
Great place for meeting friends. Lovely ambiance and great friendly service.,4
"Right across the street so can walk there. We were upstairs for a change and as tables are close together (on the side balcony) when busy, it is extremely noisy, which it was Monday. We generally find downstairs very noisy. Food generally not extraordinary but today's chicken salad was exceptional with a delicious mustard based dressing. Lettuce fresh. I was there with a friend of 70 years to celebrate my 75th birthday. Jamie was an over the top exceptional waitress and so quietly attentive and she surprised us with a piece of delicious chocolate cake with a candle.",3
Very nice dinner with my two kids and two grandchildren. The waitress was very sweet and helpful but it took a longer than normal time for our dinners to come out. The steaks were done perfectly but my daughter- in- laws fish was raw In The center. She sent the middle part back and they recooked it for her but it should have been done right from the start.,4
"Our family dinner for my brothers birthday was a hit! The meal was delish and our server, Jason, was a pleasure!",4
"We are regulars at the Miller, we love the staff!  I don‚Äôt care for the new menu, although I do like most of the food.  There isn‚Äôt a fish choice that is gourmet or without an Asian influence. Like blackened salmon or maple crusted. Flowers somewhere or just plain tropical leaves in a vase would be a nice touch. It makes a statement of fresh.",4
"This restaurant never disappoints us. We live in Mississauga, our friends live in Whitby, so we meet in the middle ! Always find the food to be delicious, service is friendly and efficient, and eating outside is perfect when weather permits, and great for parking. 
Always look forward to dining at Miller Tavern !",4
"I was disappointed with my recent visit to the Miller. Although the food was delicious, the service left more to be desired. Service was extremely slow and our waitress seemed otherwise busy. She was not attentive to our party at all. I was only asked for a drink order once and never again through the rest of the meal.",0
"Had not been to the Miller for years, great food and atmosphere, and a note to the bartending staff who were excellent in their service and their entertainment during our dinner, job well done.",4
Great location with lots of parking and fresh fish.,3
Great waiter. Food just ok. Regular coffee $4.25!!!!,1
"I nice place to go for lunch, brunch or dinner. We've been for all of the above, but more so for dinner. They also have some free parking at the back which makes it very convenient and the subway is a short distance away.",3
Great food,3
Have not been to the Miller in years - it was a great experience.  The Women's restroom - tough to use the dryer.  Great food and a great server.,3
Craig our server is outstanding!,4
"We came here for lunch as the other restaurants in the area were too expensive (Auberge du Pommier) or too fast food (Swiss Chale) or too far ... all the others. We were seated upstairs looking out on the park. Service was quick, the view was nice, the drinks well prepared and delivered quickly. 

The wives had the dim sum platter (shared) and the Salmon Salad. The men had a shared cheese platter and the peppercorn lunch steak. We shared a dessert and coffee. I would call the meal pricey. But servings were substantial and the quality was good. My steak was a little overdone but was very well prepared and tasty.

In summary, a surprisingly good steakhouse that welcomes all diners.",3
Excellent food. Amazing service. Will visit again!,4
"Over priced, low quality food. Ambiance terrible. Server miserable. Would not recommend to anyone",0
IMiller is my fabourite local restaurant,3
"We had a fantastic night thanks to the chef and our server.  We asked for a last minute switch to a booth and it was no problem.  Very accommodating.  All in all in great meal and a great night.  

Tip to the bartender - use pitted olives in martinis please!!",3
The food is very good. Asked for Diet Coke and received Pepsi. The service was just mediocre.  Brunch menu should be all weekend. Not just on Sunday.,3
"Trudy was a super server - attentive, polite and pleasant.
diverse menu choices
great seating",3
Service was excellent casual and relaxing atmosphere food great never disappoints,3
Great as always. Our waiter Craig is exceptional. The food was very tasty.,4
We were celebrating two birthdays. Acknowledgement would have been a nice touch.,3
Disappointing food and slow service.  The meal was less than good. We waited too long to give our order and too long to be served.  Won‚Äôt be going back soon at all.,1
"I have been going to the Miller for many years and the quality has slipped.  My steak was cool, for some reason it was",2
"My husband & I are regulars because it is an excellent experience!!! Great food,  a good wine list, variety,  over all, fabulous service!",4
"Jeff was an outstanding server, I took my entire team out for three birthdays and he was fantastic. Great service, we‚Äôre def coming back",4
Nice atmosphere with easy parking. Menu is good value but too much deep fried foods.,3
"This is a favourite of mine and I was a tad disappointed this time.  Love the filet mignon
you have and it was not warm enough and just over cooked your usual med rare.  Still
tasty, but I was surprised.  Creme Brulee was very bland, not  enough custard flavour -
but, of course I ate it !  Sorry - but you asked.",2
"The service was stilted at best, and the food is overpriced relative to the quality. Great wine list, though.",1
"Great steaks, great salads. Great north Toronto location!",3
Amazing food and the staff are attentive. I'd recommend this gem,4
Terrific evening.....thank you!,4
"It was a cold night and they tried to seat us by a sliding door. There was significant draft entering the restaurants. We asked to be moved and the server appeared to have been annoyed. 

We were seated in the main dining room and the new server was slow. 

Other than that, food was great",3
"this place needed a new chef badly, it has frozen dimsum for 21.5, the steak is bland, no flavour at all, the fries are burnt, the service is lacking, you can not find people when you have a request, before end of meal, billing time, all the servers circling to seize the moment, it seems that they can wait for you to leave, because the food has already put on the table. If you can avoid it, eat somewhere else to have a good meal.",0
Valentine‚Äôs Day. I don‚Äôt usually go out for this day. Kitchen was slow. Very slow. But the food was great and out server was very nice about it. Well come back on a non holiday night and enjoy.,3
"Horrible experience... requested a booth and confirmed with phone call. Once I got there with my gf, we were brought to this tiny little table!  ( the open menu is already bigger than the table!)  While a booth stayed empty the whole night I was there!!!  We waited 1 hr for the maincourse to arrive! 1 hour!! Yes, it was Valentine's day.. but we were not the ones  complaining about the wait time. Miller tavern charges premium price but we get subpar atmosphere, tiny tables and long wait times.  My gf and I are very disappointed and will never recommend this place to any one who wants to spend a special evening with their love ones.  The server was the best part of the night, she tried her best but Miller tavern failed big time.  This will be my last visit to the restaurant. Crazy disappointed!",0
"Great food
A little bit noisy
Great service from the waiter but we have to wait a long time for the soup and then for the main dishes.",3
The restaurant was quiet and comfortable. The food was lovely and the staff were attentive. The kitchen staff were a bit backed up with orders and so there was a bit of a wait for our food.,3
"We went for the prime rib, it was delicious. 
We will return to try other items on the menu.",3
"Very romantic atmosphere, with great service and food.",4
Love your neighborhood coupon; never fail to use it.,4
"The Miller Tavern will always have a special place in my wife and I hearts as it was the place we went on our first date.. as well as where I proposed to her.   Although it's harder to get to now that we live outside of the city we still like to get there as often as possible.  The food is always good and the service is exceptional.  The waitress for this past outing out did herself making us feel welcome and talking to us as if we were long time regulars.  My wife enjoyed the long list of ""small dishes"" served during your happy hour.   Reminding her of Spanish tapas, which is a favourite way of eating for her.   I truly enjoyed my steak, served as part of your Steak and Frites menu.  Perfectly done.   Well done guys.",4
"The waiter was exceptional.  Friendly service, brought out extras.  The friendly service really added to the classy atmosphere.",4
"Service was horrible.  I had requested a private table as it was a business lunch, and we were seated away from everyone else.  I‚Äôm not sure if this was the reason why the server was invisible, but service was definitely subpar.   The server took nearly half an hour before taking our orders.  After the meal was delivered, she only checked back once.  Waited forever to get the bill, and finally had to ask for it.  Never offered a refill on the coffee.  I eat at Miller fairly often and this was not typical of their usually exceptional service.",2
"We arrived earlier than expected. Your staff were delightfully accommodating . We had a most pleasant meal & drinks between old friends. Thank you! We would do it again, location was key.",3
"Great quality and variety of food. 
Nice ambience !
Craig is an outstanding waiter!",4
Great food and service as always,4
The complimentary dessert and warm Irish cream after dinner liqueur was a delightful surprise and very delicious!,2
Food is average. Ordered the Sinatra‚Äôs steak and I‚Äôm a bit disappointed,3
Enjoyable meal with extended family. Flexible with menu to adjust dish for senior. Very comfortable booth. Jerk chicken was excellent as was beef carpaccio.,4
My chicken cobb salad was the best I've ever had - really delicious!,4
"With it‚Äôs high prices, and considering we were not offered either bread or water, I cannot imagine I shall ever return.",2
Excellent ! The food was great & the restaurant room is very nice :),3
"The Miller can always be counted on to serve excellent food, with great service in a very nice environment.  We have used it many times for family events and special occasions.",4
"I went for my birthday with my family and the service was terrible and unfriendly. My sons appetizer came cold, they had my order wrong and they brought our main meals out while we were still eating our appetizer. Also over priced for the quality of the food. I'm sorry to say I would not go back.",1
"Cozy, comfortable setting. Food is always amazing (although I'd still love to see more vegetarian/vegan options). Attentive service.  Highly recommend.",4
"The Peppercorn Steak was Amazing.
Service was well above.",4
Excellent food and service.,4
The food is bland and overcooked. Medium steak came well done. Salmon came dry. Burger came bland.,2
"I had the NY strip steak and my wife ordered salmon fettucini with butternut squash risotto.  We were seated promptly and the server took our order very quickly.  In fact we finished dinner within an hour.  The steak was a good size, perfectly done and very tender.  The salmon was equally good.  We had a very enjoyable evening.",3
"We loved the meal, but we were seated in one of the exterior rooms right next to the window and it was very cold.  Either find a way of adequately heating that section or shut it down when it is extremely cold outside.",3
"Lost a bit of its allure in recent years - food quality has dropped
Too bad - because it‚Äôs a great venue",2
Service was super; food was excellent.  Ambience is relaxing and comfortable.,4
Excellent food and service. They go out of their way to make sure that your experience is fantastic!,4
I really enjoyed my birthday dinner. The staff were attentive and friendly. I left a package accidentally and they tracked me down to let me know it was there. I would definitely have dinner there again.,3
"I went with a friend and the place was busy and lively but the service with our staff, Jeff, was outstanding.  He made excellent recommendations and served us in a timely fashion, without us feeling rushed.   I had the seafood salad and my friend has the Cobb salad and we enjoyed a few cocktails as well. Dessert was fabulous and our waiter included a few freebies in the presentation.  An enjoyable evening, good food and excellent service .  I will return.",4
"Overall, we enjoyed the night however the food has declined over the past few years.  Waitress was very nice and comped us our cake slice for my daughters birthday.  Ambience is quite nice and I'd likely return.",3
"We had our holiday staff lunch at the Miller Tavern.  There was more than ample room for our group of 9.  Our entree's arrived quickly and were delicious.  The wait staff had a good rhythm going, and we were well looked after, and never felt rushed.  Thank you for  a lovely experience.",3
The food was good but a little pricey for that quality.  The noise level was off the charts.  Understandable as it was just a few days before Christmas.  We had made a reservation and expected to be seated upstairs but that didn't happen.  We'll try this place again though probably for Sunday brunch.,2
Was very busy so service was a bit slow. Otherwise food was ok.,2
"Been to this restaurant many times, it has pluses and minuses:  plus, convenient location, pleasant decor and lovely summer patio, carnivore/ seafood menu; minuses, poor vegetarian/vegan options, inconsistent menu item preparation, mediocre service.  My negative experiences are starting to outway my positive ones, probably because I‚Äôve been going more often because  the close proximity to the highway makes it a convenient meeting place...but there are others just minutes south that I‚Äôll likely add to the roster.",2
"Great venue for get together with friends, parking was easy, food quality for specials needs to improve i.e. fish and chips special, the fries were old and stale, the warm sticky pudding dessert special was not heated up, easy to speak to people and have a conversation when sitting in the covered veranda",3
"The food was excellent and the ambience warm and welcoming. The service was a bit slow.  Understand that it was busy, however, the dishes remained on the table longer than they should have and our VP had to go to the bar to pay our tab so we could leave to meet our time for another commitment.",3
"Despite that large number of people at lunch, service was quick and efficient without a long wait for our food. A good selection of food that was tasty and well presented.
One problem....the parking. We couldn't find a spot in the Miller lot nor the subway lot, so had to park several blocks down the street",3
"Ordered the steak & frites with lobster...the steak & frites were warm, the steak was actually cold. Reluctantly complained to the waitress and she took the steak back to the kitchen where they tried to warm up the steak (microwave??)...it was terrible. Could not complain too much with my customer at the table. They did not offer a discount or ask how the meal was. Will never go back there.",1
"Just recently attended Miller Tavern for a business lunch.  Classy but not pretension.  The services was very friendly, tentative but not invasive.  The food was served to us all at once, was hot and tasty.  Overall a very pleasant lunch and all of us walk away agreeing, we definately want to come back.

Thank you for an enjoyable lunch.",3
"Just ok. Very blah in a city with so many better places
Nice waiter   Steak chewy not what I expected",2
"The food was delicious. Our server, Howie, made the meal so wonderful. Fantastic service.",4
"Hi, 
I had an upsetting experience due to the worst service I have had in years in any restaurant.
The Miller Tavern is such an iconic restaurant in North York and I would not recommend to anyone to go here.",0
Good amosphere  the place is very cozy and private,3
We had an excellent lunch with friends and as we were celebrating a birthday the staff brought us complimentary desserts. A great experience thank you.,3
"This place never disappoints.  Food quality and service are very good.  In the summer, its outdoor patio as well as the screened in dining area on the second floor make the experience very pleasant.",3
"Reliable for Sunday brunch featuring all the classics and several Miller Tavern special takes on Eggs Benedict. House Eggs Benedict featured tasty biscuit instead of the standard English Muffin and featured a thick cut of Canadian bacon, sufficient Hollandaise and root veggies in the  breakfast potatoes. Prix fixe at $35 with mimosa and dessert reasonable quality. Only complaint is that they open at noon, and we were the 12:15 reservation which meant we were seated downstairs in the pub which was kind of dark for a brunch. There were guests seated upstairs by the time we left - not sure if that is their standard practice.",3
"Excellent service.Great food and wine selection.
Our salmon dish was very tasty.
We love coming to the Miller.",4
"The food is awful. It‚Äôs not worth the price. The staff was far from attentive and failed to follow a simple instruction (example: no bean sprout on the Pad Thai) The wait was more than 30 minutes AFTER we ordered for the food. The general ambiance was pleasant in appearance but a large crowd was noisy, making it difficult.",2
"Good food but they should not charge for the ‚Äúartisan‚Äù bread,   4 slices of bread cost $3.50 . Very wrong .........",3
Food great as always but our waitress upstairs disappeared into another room of the restaurant and was talking on her cell phone for a long time. Had to go to the two bartenders in the room she was in (Which has no patrons) to order another round of drinks.  I‚Äôve been here when service is attentive like a top restaurant but it was not like that last night.,2
I had the Shrimp Tacos and they were really good. The rest of our party had salmon with risotto. They said they were both good but could not finish the risotto.,3
"Great service and food, as usual! The ambiance is wonderful as well.",4
"One word ""consistant""
Not wow
Not disappointing
Have they stepped up the game? No, but they remained reliable. If you do not want to trek downtown with the traffic, this place is a great go-two place. They will not fail you",3
Spaghetti dish was fabulous. The right amount of spice.,4
Our server Jamie was amazing. Very attentive and friendly.,4
"Nice place overall but lacks in consistency.  The service is usually very good but this time it was below average. Maybe the waiter was in a bad mood :)
The prices are reasonable for the most part. My favorite is the cobb lobster salad. Unfortunately, this time the 1/2 lobster was tiny, so $32.00 for a plate of lettuce with an egg and 3 slices of avocado is a lot of money to pay.
The patio is lovely in the summer.",3
"Everything was fine. Good selection  of wine and beer.  Food was good, although sides at $4.00 extra rather absurd.",3
"The food was pretty good till we got to the main course.
The steak was not great. Very plain.",2
"Very good, a go to place!",4
"Miller used to be good food. Now overpriced,   lower quality in my opinion. I hope each time someone says let's meet at the Miller that it has improved. Used to be great. Burger I had was just plain dry for $17 horrible. Fry's  good. menu changed but not  in my wheelhouse. Will need to improve before i go back. Service was good.",2
"Great location.
Needs more parking.
Personable, attentive service.
Interesting, varied menu.
Beautifully-prepared food.",4
We had a lovely meal with perfectly cooked steaks.  The servers  were very attentive & accommodating & the ambience warm & inviting.,3
Consistently great food.  Big diverse menu.  Fabulous service.   One of our favorites.   We will be back !!,4
"There were 2 servers at our table tonight. The lady was really nice, very energetic and friendly. The male server, not so much. He talked really fast in a quiet voice and seemed like he had better things to do than waiting on us. When he saw out plates were emty, he walked over and asked: ""You done?"" Like he coudn't wait for us to go. Being served with an attitude like his, I really didn't feel like we were welcome at the place, plus it was my friend's birthday and I wanted to treat her to a nice dinner. But the food was nice, although the presentation of the plate was a bit stale.",3
Good service and food.  excellent for a business lunch when placed in the right area,3
Service was exceptionally slow.  Didn‚Äôt seem to be enough staff on hand for a packed Sunday night.,2
"I've been to The Miller quite frequently, however the last two times I was not pleased with the food.",2
Excellent lunch with terrific service.,3
"I reserved by Open Table a few nights prior.  I also stated it was a Special Birthday, but there was NO mention of it when we arrived, or at any time during the meal.  There was also NO available parking at 7 pm on a Thursday night.  We had to park next door at the Green P.

We have been having our Christmas parties here for the last Five years and would have liked to receive  a little 'special' treatment!",3
My husband & I  frequent The Miller & we love the staff! The food is excellent & they make it seasonal. Our favourite is their outside dining it is multi level and a great all around experience. My husband lives their steaks & I love the vegetarian choices.,4
"Spur of the moment decision to dine at the Miller and was not disappointed as usual.
The steak frites specials were tasty and the service was excellent.
The sticky toffee pudding desert is a must!",4
"Service was very slow but it was nice not being interrupted constantly. However, didn't appreciate the dirty dishes being left on the table the whole time. Had to pay for the bread which is fine but the bread was stale and the butter was rock hard. My soup was delicious and my guest's Pad Thai was amazing. Still love this place but it's really becoming a hit and miss dining experience.",3
"We had great food and the best service!
Craig the waiter is amazing! Very attentive ,friendly and great at recommending us what dishes to order.",4
"I have always liked the Miller, but it is overpriced for what you get.",2
"Great! Busy place, great location see you soon. Acc right across the street, perfect before concert",4
"Almost verything about our evening was great except for the noise level of the bar area. Seating wasn't available upstairs when we dined. Seating in our corner booth needs to be reupholstered....very uncomfortable banquette seats. Service excellent. Food delicious and interesting, creative combinations. Desserts delicious and creative. Coffee could have been better....didn't taste freshly-brewed.  $300 with tip for 5 people including one drink each seemed reasonable. Bread should not be an additional charge...ours was shown as complimentary on the final bill.",3
Great staff. The food was so-so. A bit overpriced for some items and a little annoying to have to pay for bread.,3
First time at Miller Tavern and somewhat disappointed.  The food and service was average or similar to a chain type restaurant.,1
"It was my little brother‚Äôs birthday. It‚Äôs steak fest time, but we ordered from the regular menu, being we have hearty appetite, Miller Tavern doesn‚Äôt  disappoint. Good value, no pretense, cozy.",3
As always I have a better expectation that what is delivered.  I don't know why but service is not the best.  There is not much else around which is why we always end up at Miller.  I think for the location they can do way better!,1
"Was seated on the ""terrace"" on a dull, rainy day.  And parking was in a paid lot.  Overall, though, a great place to get together for lunch or dinner, food is terrific, prices a bit above average, pub downstairs is great and the main room upstairs is very elegant.",3
"The server was very polite, pleasant and understanding of our need to talk as we had not seen each other for 17 years.  No rushing, time to laugh and catch up.
This was the best Caesar salad with chicken  I have ever had - I REALLY MEAN IT!  The pumpkin cheese cake and special coffee were delicious !  The Miller is always great!",4
"We sat outside in the back patio. Nice decor, service, and food.",4
Lunch with family,2
"I will admit that after visiting the Miller for over 10 years, the service is still disappointing. It has always been slow and last week was no different. We had to wait to place our order and had to wait a long time for our drinks. While our waiter was friendly, everything just took a long time.",2
We had a great time!   The food was delicious!  Our waitress was attentive!  I would definitely recommend it to a friend.   Particularly the brunch!!!,4
Fairly good experience nothing note worthy.,2
Patio was just perfect  to enjoy dinner and sangria was a nice touch.,4
"Reliable with a good variety of appealing meals (plus a strong alcoholic beverages menu).
Just wish they'd keep Miller a little quieter.",3
"Excellent as always. The servers are personable and very attentive.
Thank you",4
"Great food, great ambiance and excellent servers.
I just moved into Midtown and It's my new favourite place. I bring all my friends here.",4
Cesar salad very disappointing - glad I did not have it as a main.  Filet was very tender but the cheese garnish overwhelmed and it was not hot.,2
Average fare at high prices for lunch. Nothing fabulous - just ok.,1
The service and food was very good - mostly it was appreciated that we were having a business meeting and were not pushed or rushed to finish.  It is a central spot that allows for people from all over the city to get to easily,3
Great wait staff. Steak was perfectly cooked. Nice sides. TV loud.,3
Delicious choice of options.  I had the Jerk Chicken. Loved it.  Restaurant has two levels and an outdoor seating area.  There is also a larger room that can be used if you want to have a meeting.,3
Great food and service,3
We enjoyed the summer steak frite special menu.  Loved the steak with the watermelon feta salad.,4
"The ambience left me relaxed and satisfied.. I anticipated my chosen repeated entr√©e of jerk chicken with enthusiasm and a big appetite. It did not disappoint. My guest is a vegan but she could find suitable food.

While waiting for the dishes we had a quiet conversation and could hear each other quite well, not like other restaurants.

All in all, a good experience.",4
"The food is not as good as I expect it for the price!! 
And they a really slow it take like 40 min for the steak to come out.",2
We were celebrating a birthday ... the meal and service was wonderful.... the birthday dessert was a lovely chocolate fondue... a lovely surprise. It was quote loud as there were 6 customers at the bar getting quote excited about the gold game on tv... other than that - the experience was overall extremely positive ! Thank u!!,4
"Enjoy your outdoor patio dining, friendly staff and have seldom been disappointed in the food you offer",3
"Bland food, slow service, dirty menu. Tables and silverware were in need or replacing.",0
Anniversary,3
My friend and I had a lovely evening. Our waiter was very helpful. The food was good and patio lovely. All and all a great experience.,3
"Better than I remembered, will make this a regular spring going forward!",4
"We had a lovely evening except when it came to eating our meal, we couldn't see what we were eating!! Needs more outdoor lighting!",3
"One of our favorite places in uptown Toronto.  It never disappoints. Not inexpensive, but very much great value. You definitely get what you pay for (and then some)-. We were in a bit of a hurry this time because of tickets to a show downtown, but still got a superb meal in a timely fashion and exceptional service, as always.",4
"I made a reservation for a 4 year anniversary with my girlfriend. I had been once to this place before and had a great experience. 

This time we sat outside and the waiter was extremely rude. He came up and just waived at the drinks menu to us and just kept walking to another table. He did not introduce himself or speak to us at all. His first impressions is that he pointed at the drink menu and kept walking. We passed through that and then came and was like ""DRINKS?"" my girlfriend was thinking and he goes like ""you seem like you are going to take a while"" and as I was asking for a beer he walked away . When my girlfriend ordered water he was very rude almost like we have to order an alcoholic beverage??

I decided this is not what my anniversary dinner should be like, so I went and approached him and told him that ""he needs to learn how to talk to customers with respect, and that I do not want to be a part of this experience"" his response was ""okay good night"" and it definitely did get better as we went to The Keg and had a great night. 

I am probably not stepping back into that place, but my advice to the restaurant managers and owners to first not hire incompetent people who hate their lives and as a result they are speaking with no respect what so ever to their customers and that if they want to hire such people to make sure to train them well.",0
"Great spot to meet friends.....great food, great service !",4
"This was my first visit and it was exceptional, Food service and ambience!
I will return soon and often.",4
"Loved the patio! Good food, good service, no complaints!! Suggested for an after work dinner",3
"Seafood salad platter is amazing ! Service could've been a tad faster as we were in a rush to order - on a normal day, it would've been fine :)",3
"Outstanding service, great food ,great selection of food and wine.Beautiful surroundings and ambience.",4
Great outdoor dining.  One of the best patios in the city.,4
"Outstanding service, excellent steak.",4
"Disgusting food.    Batter falls off fried calamari.  
Seafood pad Thai tasted horrible.   
Jerk chicken was meh. 
For this price, would never come here again

Nice
Ambiance and service not bad.   Too bad food was a disgrace.",1
you should let your patrons know that the dining room is not open on holiday Mondays.  if we wanted to eat in a bar we would have gone to the Firkin!,2
Good time good service. Our server was  Jeff who was the best. Thanks for a good experience. Will return in the near future.,4
Great time except my lamb burger was not good-I told the waiter but he did not want offer to exchange it for something else or to take off the bill,3
This place was recommend for a special occasion and we found it to be a great place for any type of dinner.  The food was great and we will definitely be back to try out all the different types of meals.,4
"We used to live just down the street from The Miller and frequented often. It was a great place to get a variety of oysters, which I love but my wife does not. They served great spicy cheese biscuits and the Caesar salad came with optional blue cheese. All terrific. Unfortunately, when we moved away 6 years ago, we must have taken the best of The Miller with us. No oysters (except on Thursdays and Fridays - while they last), no cheese biscuits (no free bread even) and unfortunately the strip steak I had was really tough (cooked rare as I requested). The B√©arnaise sauce I requested was nothing like one (it was, I suspect, a Hollandaise). I must say that while the meal was not horrible, it was disappointing, considering what I remembered. Server was cheerful and orders were accurately served.",2
"I had a terrible experience! My judgement regarding a steak I ordered was questioned when I told them it was not done to my satisfaction, because it was not medium. The manager had the nerve to show me a picture of ""my steak"" to show me I was wrong! What an insult!! I have dined at the Miller many times and have never been so furious and insulted! Although the manager did comp the steak, the damage had been done. I don't know who he thinks he is. or what superior knowledge he thinks he has, but I was humiliated in front of my friends, and very angry,",0
Decor is lovely but food and service were awful. Arrived at 7 pm and did not get our food until 8:35 and then it was cold!!! We Actually complained to the manager who did not have the savvy to know what to do. I would never recommend it. It was very Overpriced and just not worth it,0
We sat on the patio on Friday evening  and had a wonderful first date . Our waiter was great and the wine and food was delicious.  Thanks,4
Our occasional special place for family gatherings -,4
"The Miller has a great combination of good food, good service, a nice easy to get to location,  outdoor seating without being fully outdoors and reasonable, but not cheap, Pricing.",3
Mentioned that we were Celebrating our 5th Wedding Anniversary during our booking; nearly every staff member congratulated us.  Service and attention to detail at the highest level. Also one of the best Rib-Eyes I've ever had.,4
"Food was great but our party of 10 and guaranteed tip for our waitress wasn't enough to make them actually see how we were doing. We were never asked how our food was , was never checked upon and had to ask another server for more drinks. Service was absolutely awful",2
"The restaurant & service was nice enough but when we arrived there were men working spray painting the outdoor railings. The railings were on the second floor , we had to ask 3 times to have them stop while we ate, first of all it was spray paint and it was in the air, secondly it smells, not the nicest ambiance to enjoy your lunch.  Our waitress explained that it had to be completed.  Why is this not completed prior to 11:30 when the restaurant opens?
They did eventually stop as other guests were seated in the Patio",2
"Great neighbourhood place...lots of options from steaks to pastas to oysters, to great salads, etc etc....all in a very beautifully restored building",4
Dinner on the amazing three tiered patio. Service was prompt and pleasant. Food was nicely presented. They brought a complementary birthday dessert. Lovely evening!,4
"We had a great Sunday brunch outside on the patio! Although all the tables on our level were full, it was very easy to have conversation & be heard. The staff were accommodating & professional throughout our meal. The peach Bellini was excellent, as were the Eggs Benedict with crab cakes. The Apple Cinnamon cake was also a hit with several at our table.",4
"I was disappointed that they no longer had their butternut squash, cranberry and goat cheese salad.

Their Buddha bowl really lacked flavour.",2
"My sister and I celebrated a birthday lunch here a few days ago. We sat on the patio, the service was excellent, as was the food. The restaurant very generously gave us a complimentary dessert to celebrate this special occasion. We had a great time and will return.",4
We always enjoy the miller. Our friends always enjoy eating there as well. It's our go-to restaurant.,0
"Went for a birthday and was not disappointed! Good food, good ambiance and reasonably priced. Would recommend and will definitely return!",4
My lady friend said it was fantastic . She is impressed with my selection. Great restaurant,4
"Our server Howie was amazing! Attentive, professional, and humorous:)",4
"Sat on the lower patio and it was a fantastic evening.
Our server forgot about us once or twice, but we were just enjoying beverages at this time so it wasn't a huge deal.
Always enjoy the atmosphere at The Miller.",3
I got a chicken salad which was very good. But my wife's steak she didn't like it at all. The server was very good and the place was very well suited for a business dinner.,2
Perfect location for my dad's 83rd birthday lunch.  We were a party of 4.  Howie is an awesome server.  He contributed in making my dad's small celebration special.  Food was great.  Diverse menu to cater to all our different eating habits.,3
"Thia place a wonderful, the staff was attentive and polite, the food is great and  the ambiance is beautiful. I've been there 2 times and would recommend it to anyone looking great food.",4
Servers tried to hurry us and remove dishes without ensuring we were finished. Made several errors in the orders. Steaks were very small for the price and meat not very tender. Only good thing was the patio.,2
Very relaxed and comfortable. we had great service and the food was fabulous. recommended for any occasion,4
Always enjoy the Miller for the good and friendly staff. Just a great place to relax,4
Good service. Lamb burger over cooked and dry. Chicken breast with salad was also dry. Fruit cobbler very good.,2
"Met my kids for Sunday Brunch (lunch) and ate on the patio. Food was fabulous, good value and selection. We had the seafood salad and would do so again. Burgers looked awesome as well. Good selection of beers and wine. Kids had Caesars and mimosas.  Everyone was happy with all the food and beverages.",4
Food not great but outside seating very nice. Nice place to have a beer.,2
went for a business dinner.  Been there many times. Very consistent and dependable with service.,3
"We were there on a Sunday when only the downstairs is open. The service and food were excellent, however it was very noisy and it wasn't half full. TV's are a distraction. Have been here many time's on other nights and have only sat upstairs. Won't come again on a Sunday.",3
Great except for the noise from a rather large birthday party.  The food was superb - best vegetarian burger I ever had!!!,3
"Surf and turf reasonably priced.. service wasn't good this time .. we asked what sides came with the meal and later found a charge for mashed potatoes? Also they charge for bread? 
Might go back for wine on the patio but that's the end of my dining experiences there...",2
"The food was good. However, comparing with foods of the same quality in similar restaurants, it was quite expensive.",2
"This place was wonderful, the food was great. The staff was extremely friendly.",4
Food was delicious and creative/ we sat outside but protected/ perfect solution when the weather is iffy/ staff were attentive and got us out in plenty of time for the show/ I look forward to returning soon,4
"Good Food, nice ambience",3
"We had a delicious lunch at a quiet table on the upstairs terrace inside.  We all enjoyed our meals, the ambiance and hope to come back soon.  Thank you for a great experience.",4
"Excellent service,  would be nice if appetizers could be personalized to add 1 or 2 extra items per order.",3
"Our lunch was very good, served quickly and without a hitch. Often come here for family birthday dinners as everyone likes it.",4
Lunch was acceptable with the shrimp crab cakes being somewhat overcooked.  My prime rib sandwich was good.  Onion soup was ok,3
"The steak I ordered was horribly bad -over cooled!!

Frozen fries not hand cut!!

No oysters were on the menu???-I thought this was a sea food restaurant 

Food presentation was non excistant!!

Very disappointed!",0
Would not want to be in that separate room on second floor again.   Might be good for private parties but not as overflow   We felt cut off from restaurant ambiance and acoustics make it very loud in there.   I'd opt to go elsewhere vs sit in there again.,2
"Great time at the Miller Tavern for Mother's Day Brunch. Our waiter was amazing and very accommodating. Food was good, dessert could be better. 

I had the Yonge st burger, it was perfectly served on a brioche bun. I would have to say that keptchup and condiments the way they are served in those mini dishes kind of sucks, it takes forever to get them and it's messy! Fries tasted like bag fries burger was really good",4
"Good ambiance, decor, service. We went for Mothers day, there was a 3-course fixed price menu offered for the brunch (regular full menu was not offered). And although the food was tasty, it was clear (by the taste, look, and extremely quick delivery - only 2 minutes if that long) that the food had been prepared in advance and warmed just prior to serving. For the prices I was expecting food made to order. Disappointing; I might return for drinks but definitely not for a meal.",2
"Very disappointed in the quality of the food. The steak did not have any taste to it and the steak frites was ok but not great. We used to enjoy going there but the cost doesn't live up to the quality of the food. You may want to consider House of Chan or another steak place I give this 2 out of 5. 
I wish I could give this a higher rating as the staff is excellent and I wish they had a better product to go with the service. 
The dessert chocolate cake was very good",1
"The food was very good, and our waiter was kind. He kept forgetting however that a member of our party had Celiac, and couldn't eat gluten. I would recommend The Miller Tavern, but not perhaps for people with allergies. It was my Aunt's birthday, and it was kind of them to give her a complimentary piece of cake. Regretfully, she couldn't eat it because it wasn't gluten-free. It was a nice gesture though! It is a great place to eat and watch the game on the screens in the bar area.",3
"Thank you.  My friend and I had a lovely dinner.  Our waiter was terrific, attentive, and patient with us as we chatted away.  We will be back for sure.  Take care and best wishes.",3
"Excellent service, good food, great place to meet up with old friends
in a friendly atmosphere.",3
The waiter was new and excellent.  Took the time to make the meal perfect.,4
"We have been to the Miller Tavern many times over the years and it used to be one of our favourite restaurants. The last three times (including this one) we were disappointed with it. The food was mediocre, where it used to be great. My husband had a steak a previous time, and roast beef this time, and both times the meat was so tough as to be inedible.  This time, they had no oysters (it is an oyster bar!). My favourite meal here used to be the lobster quesadilla, which has now been moved to the appetizer menu, cheaper and presumably smaller. The place is looking shabby, it's much more a bar now than a nice restaurant. I had to ask a patron at the next table to lower his voice, he was drowning us out. Our server was very nice, even if a little rough around the edges. I'm disappointed that the restaurant has disimproved over time. We will not be returning.",1
"While the service and ambiance was really nice- the food was mediocre at best. My fianc√© had surf and turf; the lobster tail was overlooked and tasteless and the frites were soggy and old tasting. The steak was the one redeeming part of our main courses, as it was cooked nicely and was tasty. I had salmon and while the fish itself was tasty, it was overcooked. The vegetables on my plate included a single green bean and one sprig of broccoli.  Deserts were tasty, but not enough to save this very blah meal. This place could be great for drinks in terms of ambiance, but I won't be back for food.",1
"My wife and I met up with friends we hadn't seen in a few years for dinner.  The ambiance is good, the upstairs booth was not too secluded but also not too noisy, just right.  When we ordered wine, the waiter recommended the most expensive bottle on the list I was looking at.  Huh.  In any case, they had a Steak Frites promotion going on, so the other three ordered ... steak frites.  The ladies asked for medium steaks and got medium-rare, but no real complaints there.  I ordered the Seafood Pad Thai, and was less than impressed.  The noodles were narrow, it was really saucy (thin liquid), and lacked balance (couldn't detect the lemongrass or fish sauce).  It seemed like more of a seafood pasta with a bit of Asian seasoning, than Pad Thai with salmon replacing the chicken.  The dessert was a nice surprise though, they brought us Irish coffee shots and a chocolate fondue with fruit, without us asking or ordering it.  That was a nice finish to the meal.",3
"Went there for the steak event. I ordered the New York with a lobster tail - they were both  pretty flavourless and no sauce or melted butter was given. My partner ordered the steak frites. Both steaks were VERY undercooked. My partner ordered Medium/Rare and it came out blue rare - it literally looked like the middle wasn't cooked at all and straight from the package. Sending it back didn't help much. I ordered Medium/well and it was more Medium-Medium/rare. The service was pretty good, however when we asked what the steak sides were, we were just told fries or salad. I saw on the menu later that there were way more options including sweet potato fries.",2
Fantastic meal and great service. The decor was very relaxing and people were very friendly.,4
I've been the the Miller before and had a terrible food experience. I decided to give the Miller a try again to see if they got better by any chance. I Made a reservation for 3 but when we got to the table it was set for 2. We ordered and finally received our steaks. All of our steaks had to get sent back. One steak was ordered medium-well done  and it came out rare. The other was supposed to be well done and it came out rare. Lastly my steak was supposed to be rare. It came out medium. When the meal was sent back they just reheated the meat. Not replace the steak as most places do. Overall unimpressed and I it's unfortunately that I won't be returning.,1
"While the food ingredients are top notch, the service on par with the $$$s, the restaurant is rather worn down and I had seen better Swiss Charlets when it comes to ambience, utensils as well as noise level. Lobster quesadilla was the worst dish we had. We can see the lobster bits but we can't taste it at all.  It's like magic! Only in a bad way.",2
"Went for the steak frites event. Can't really do steak frites with frozen fries, but the steak wasn't bad. Cooked medium rare as requested.",2
"We were at Miller Tavern for Sunday brunch prix fixe which I have had numerous times before. Not sure what happened but my gosh the food quality deteriorated significantly. Crab cake benedict was made with stale english muffin and the waffles I had were just sub par, cheap quality. I was very disappointed. I will not return for brunch.",0
The ambience was very relaxing and casual. The waitress provided excellent service. Our food was amazing.,3
"We waited a good 15 minutes for our server and another server came by to check on us to get our order - which was great.  It wasn't very busy so we were a bit surprised that nobody was coming around our group.  We indicated that some of us were travelling for work and needed individual receipts. 

Through the meal / stay service was good - but then the bill arrived all on one.  We asked that this be broken up as that was what we had originally requested and the server became rude and told us it would take at least 15-20 minutes for him to break up the bill.

While each of us were paying the server just grabbed our receipt and jammed the payment machine at us with no conversation - no thankyou after payment - nothing.  Some chose not to leave a tip due to this childlike behavior. 

Have been to the Miller before as it is close to our offices and we would hope to come back due to its convenience, but if we ever had 'Ty' again as a server, we would ask for someone else - or leave.",2
"A comfortable, welcoming atmosphere with good food and service. Prices a bit on the higher side, but not excessive. Plenty of parking. Would be nice if the upstairs washrooms could accommodate more than one person at a time, but it wasn't an issue at lunch time.",3
"Went last weekend, wanted to try out this restaurant that has been there forever. The location and ambiance is ok however the service is extremely slow and the staff fails to connect  with you. Tried the fish which was flavorless and disappointing. Had ordered a medium rare steak which came as more rare than medium rare.  there is no point struggling if the service is so slow. Overall, nothing memorable about the food and money is spent somewhere else better.",1
Great service and great meal!,4
Good and service were both excellent!,4
"The service was very good. The selection from the the steak frit was just ok. My steak cut was not the best. I had to ask for steak sauce since there wasn't any flavour . The appetizers were ok we ordered the Dim Sum but for the amount of food we received for the the price we paid was ridiculous. 
Not sure to return !",2
"Went during the steak frites festival. Food was pretty good but not very good value--8 oz steaks for $30 but they're not the best cuts and need the accompanying sauces. Enjoyed the banana popcorn caramel dessert though--it doesn't sound like it'll work, but it did!",2
The Steak Frites is outstanding!  Service is very attentive.,3
"The service was great, but my seafood was supposed to be warm was cold. But it was great atmosphere and amazing service.",2
Loved our server and Alex Ord. also the food was great!,4
"As always, consistently good.  Enjoyed the meal and the ambiance.",3
"Good experience, good food and good ambience.  We brought a cake for birthday celebration, not knowing that there is a charge for plate fee until the bill came.  Would be nice if the waiter told us ahead of time...",3
Very good restaurant and great for special occasion or a quiet dinner,3
we enjoyed the atmosphere and we had great service. The food was excellent.,4
I have been to Miller Tavern several times and have always been impressed with the quality of the food and service.  I have no reservation in recommending them.,4
Valentines dinner- salmon was excellent! Will be back!,3
The food was good and the service was excellent. Both can be hard to find!,3
"A great Valentine's Day dinner! The Miller Tavern will never disappoint! 
This is my ""go to"" restaurant to ensure a perfect occasion every time!",4
Wonderful food! Love the lamburger and the plum sauce . My son goes there for business lunches all the time.,4
"Made the reservation only because we were going to in the area. Service was uninspired, but fine. The place needs a major face lift but then that would only solve the lesser issue still leaving patrons With not great food.",1
Great oysters bar and always good quality stakes!! Lobster quesadia is a must try! Simply the best Ceasar around..,3
"The roast beef diner was not enjoyable, the meat was tough and a lot of fat.",2
"Good food, fusion of inventive menu and comfort foods. They had the one dollar lobster tail special which I went for. Was excellent. Nice wine selections by the glass.",4
"Been 3 times and always good. This time the kitchen seemed to be off their game. Steak was way undercooked for medium rare, it was still pretty blue in the centre. Server took it back and brought back the same steak I'd already eaten with grill marks. Grossed me out that food off someone's plate would be put back on a cook top. Couldn't finish it. It was tasty up until then.",2
"For many years a group of friends met at the Miller Tavern.
The location was perfect for our mix of urban and suburbanites.
We enjoyed the menu and the up scale service that the $$ warranted.
However, our experience this last week poor on all aspects (exception, my 
Cobb salad was tasty but the others had mediocre steak frites) 
It started with a disinterested host who could not find our reservation and 
flippantly said ""I must have booked at the downtown location""
Seating us, than asking us to move to another table, in a mostly empty room.
The waiter was okay at first. He brought our food and  rushed past to ask how everything was. I said fine, but my friend's were not offered ground pepper for their steaks.We were asked if we were ready for the bill approx 8:00pm! No we were not! We would like coffee. When we declined desserts the bill was placed on the table 
"" anytime you are ready ladies"" We started to pull out of wallets, the waiter swiped the cards. We placed part of the bill in cash in the folder and I put my cell phone on top. Again he swept in, moved my phone and muttered ""thanks""
So disappointing because it was our go to restaurant for a gathering a couple times a year.
We all commented, not the same level of service we had enjoyed in the past.",1
"Food was good, could be better, service was great and pretty good envoirnment but parking was an issue.",3
"Empty restaurant and one should not have to request they take your order-
Service should be prompt. Came to take order and we needed a couple of minutes. Then we waited. No excuse for that behaviour",2
Great food and value for sunday brunch,3
"Another amazing meal at the Miller. The $1 lobster special was a nice touch to the delicious seafood and steak meals my wife and I had for her birthday. The heated upstairs sunroom area was very comfortable and perfect for nice conversation on a friday evening. We were fortunate enough to get our favourite server, Howie, and he ensured our evening was perfect. He is so friendly and he even remembered the stories we told him of our kids from about 2 years ago! Homie you're amazing and make the place special. Keep it up Miller Tavernüëçüëçüëç",4
"Great food for a good price, order a steak or entr√©e and lobster tall for only a $1.",4
"Food was okay, it's passable for the price. Steak was good, not amazing, but then again, didn't expect it to be given the price range.",3
"Great spot for a group lunch. Good food at reasonable prices with a good list of items on the menu. Nice location however the restaurant free parking lot can fill quickly. There is a paid municipal parking lot next to the restaurant with lots of space. 

Service was a little slow and my food was very good but not hot -  just warm. 

Nice ambiance with different sections spread over two floors so it has a cosy feel to it. 

Recommended for a family, business or group event.",3
"I came with my boyfriend for a dinner and were really impressed by the light tuna nacho appetizer as well as well done and tender new york steak, with a lobster tail added just for $1! We finished off with a chocolate cake served with some delightful raspberry sorbet. All along, the service was top notch - our waitress, Elizabeth, was lovely, knowledgeable and gave brilliant recommendations for wine!",4
Dinner was really good once it finally came out.  However the service was slow. The waiter was busy and wasn't very attentive.,3
Excellent quality of food and exceptional service.,4
"We enjoyed the food and service, but were unfortunately seated behind a very loud table of three business men with one particular individual a real blowhard!!!  I don't know when he had time to eat with the constant verbiage from his mouth about how great he was.  Otherwise the food was delicious, and thank heavens they left before we had dessert, although I had to ask them to take their ongoing conversation away while they were putting their coats on.
:cb",2
We meet twice a year.  Our group will be back in June sometime,4
"Good service , food are good , dessert was so so .",4
Food was excellent. Service was friendly and pleasant but slow - did not come to take our dessert order for a long time after he brought dessert menus. Desserts were also slow in coming. Reception is always warm and friendly!,3
Good Food and the wait staff were all very friendly. I would have liked it to be slightly brighter and slightly quieter. Menu should have pictures to see what we are ordering. Other than that it was great service and food.,4
We all ordered steaks and these were made exactly as ordered. Everything about the food and the service was excellent!,4
Great first time experience. Everyone enjoyed the food and atmosphere.,4
"I came with my girlfriends for our annual holiday get together and greatly enjoyed our experience. We ordered pakoras, calamari rings and vegetable spring rolls as appetizers and were pleasantly surprised to be able to have the opportunity to add a lobster tail to our steak and seafood entrees for $1 extra, which we did.  The wait staff was incredibly friendly and checked up on us often.  When the bill came, our waitress didn't charge us for one dessert explaining it was because my gf's steak was a bit dry, which we were not at all expecting but grateful for.  We will definitely be returning soon.",4
It was scheduled booked in advance birthday party but we have been placed next to the front door in a darkness. Disappointed.,2
We were disappointed the upstairs was closed.  It was just too noisy.   Our server was excellent as well as our food.,3
"We met up with 2 other couples and ate in the lower dining area. Our server was awesome, very personable and the atmosphere was perfect for a fun and relaxed night out.",4
"I've been a few times. Consistently great food! Service is friendly but not reliable. Washrooms need to be upgraded with more sanitary conditions eg, better water pressure/ soap for hand washing, provide paper towels for hand drying and using on door handles on the way back to the dining room. Still, I would return for the food and ambiance.",3
We had a great dinner.  Our waiter was very pleasant and attentive.,4
"I take colleagues every Xmas, partially  because of the good food but also because I know they look forward to the annual event and location.

Occasionally I & my wife visit during the year for lunch on the patio",4
Pleasant atmosphere and a menu with a broad range of items to choose from. I choose this restaurant often to meet friends because it has convenient free parking and is accessible by subway.,2
"We were disappointed in the quality of the food for the price.  We had dim sum and crab cakes for appetizers, neither of which were very tasty, and jerk chicken and pad Thai, neither of which were as good as we have had at other restaurants at much lower prices.",2
Worst service ever from coat check (or lack of caring to even ask) to waiter. Terrible service.,1
"Great ambience, courteous wait staff. Great filet mignon steak, but halibut is not good. It was served cold and too raw and underdone. Fish tasted old and as if it was turning. Asked for it to be brought back and   heated but when it was, it tasted worse. I would not recommend the fish.",2
Had not been here in a few years used to frequent when I lived in the hood. Food was average and expensive. I have had a better steak at the keg and also our food was cold.,2
"I have been several times in here. I enjoyed a nice seafood platter in last year, so I expected to get better experience in this time than in last year. But, it was not easy to get better experience than last time. However, here is worth to be recommendable to be one time.",2
Spicy thai steak salad is fabulous!,3
We waited for an hour for our food...but then it was worth it..we would return for sure!,3
Excellent. Comment.   The plate was hot. The food was not,4
"Consistently good. Broad menu, welcoming, interesting layout, great ambiance, just the right sound level, very good service, very good food, clean tables & cutlery, clean washrooms, very good value ... make a reservation ... enjoy.",3
Fantastic waitress!!! Very impressed with her.,4
"As always, The Miller provides a great place to go for dinner. Great food and service can always be counted on. This place remains my all time favourite!",4
"Dinner is better than lunch.  Service was great, but the food did not measure up to the service unfortunately.",2
"I asked for a quiet table and got seated on the veranda, when it finally became too noisy (I wear hearing aids) I asked the waiter if we could move and he said sure, I noticed you wanted a quiet table!!!  Then we got moved downstairs (which was nearly empty) and were seated by a door that was cold.  

And they're using frozen fries.  

They charge too much for this level of quality.",2
"It took a very long time for the food to come out!  From the kids menus, the chicken fingers were dry and the fries were just ok.  The rest of the food was good though.",2
"Ok food at best, but mediocre service for what's supposed to be a country club-esque establishment.

I got the fixed price brunch: cranberry juice to start, crabcake benedict main, and an apple cinnamon butter cake to finish. The homemade biscuits that came with the crabcake benedict were very dry, but I guess that's why there's all that runny egg yolk. The apple cinnamon butter cake, while a generous portion, was also way too sweet. I couldn't ask for enough tea to rinse that situation out.

The service left much to be desired. The gentleman who took care of us was gruff from the get-go. Shortly after we placed our orders I heard him complaining to his colleagues about something not related to work. OK, so maybe you're having a bad day...but please don't take it out on your customers!

He was pretty blase the rest of the time we were there, and shortly after coming by to check in on our desserts (we weren't even half done), he proceeded to leave us with the bill. My friend had a coupon that she didn't even have a chance to present to him. So when she asked him about it, we got a ""Oh, well then I guess I'll need to print you another bill."" Way to state the obvious, my friend!! We also never even asked for the first print of the bill to begin with. It wasn't like the place was packed and they needed the table back for another party.

To make matters worse, I heard him say ""God help me"" once right after he walked away from our table to reprint our bill, and once again right as he walked away after he processed our payments (!!!!!!!!!!!)

It was also the first time I ever had my credit card snatched out of my hand...I never thought it would happen here of all places. You don't need to roll out the red carpet for us, but some basic courtesy would have gone a long way.

So there you have it. Given all the dining options we have around town, I'm in no real rush to come back to this place. Save your time and money...it's not worth spending either here.",0
"Met up with some old friends from the neighborhood i grew up in for pre-Christmas dinner .  Ordered prime rib medium and it was practically raw.  As I have had issues in the past with the food I didn't say much until everyone had finished .  My friend also had the prime rib and was terribly disappointed.  I advised the server , who was nowhere around during our meal, that she should notify the kitchen of this issue, she simply shrugged her shoulders and said "" sorry about that"".  No apology from a manager or discount on the bill ( not that I wanted a discount , but a gesture would have been appreciated).  I have come to terms with the fact that this just isn't the right place for us to gather for future events ... too bad , we liked it there",3
Excellent food and service. Always enjoyable evening at Millers,3
food was very good-service was mediocre.  We were 6 and the area was not busy.  We took friends there for their first time-they probably won't go back-we will only cuz we know the resto,3
"The food was pretty good, but it`s overpriced and the service, although friendly, was rushed. 
If I`m paying over $200 for dinner for two (no drinks, just two glasses of wine each) I want to have the time to enjoy it leisurely. The restaurant is quite large and there were empty tables, so it`s not like they were waiting for people to finish in order to seat others.
Not sure if I`d go back.",2
"We love this place! Even being our second time, will definitely be going back! Even looking at having our anniversary, birthdays and next year a big family Christmas dinner.

It's not just the good food, it's the fun staff, peaceful place to enjoy a night out!

Looking at coming back very soon.",4
"Excessive heat (due to a warm sun) is understandable but it could have been easily remedied by opening the patio's sliding window for 5 minutes.  Instead,  the heat was turned down but it made no difference and what was a fine meal and service was undermined by extreme heat.
Flexibility is needed when there are exceptional circumstances; my guest's (birtrhday lunch)comfort  could have been enhanced by opening the patio window for 5 minutes.   It wasn't done.
Disappointing end to the meal.",3
"Very bad service, 45 minutes for a salad!!!",0
"I enjoy going to the Miller Tavern, but, if I'm honest, I find the food just ok.  They would benefit from consistently uping their game on all menu items.",2
This is a great spot for either casual or special occasion dining.  We've been here many times and love it.,4
"This was my second visit to  The Miller and was seated in a different area.
I was able to experience the bar while waiting for my section to open, as I was early to arrive.
The bar was very friendly and had a nice number of people there with tv screens and the bartender was so funny and made me feel very comfortable.

My friend arrived and I was very happy to see a new addition to the menu, which we both had and enjoyed thoroughly - Black Cod with sweet potato mash and green beans.  We asked for more veggies, and they just appeared on the table - voila!

A very nice experience for the second time.  Staff and food are awesome, as well as the ambience.

Had a very enjoyable and memorable time.  Looking forward to my next visit.",4
"The wait staff were friendly, efficient and thoughtful. My Caesar salad was delicious and I would highly recommend the crab cakes.",4
"Soup tasted like tomato soup out of a can, not red pepper.
Very expensive steak.",2
"Our waitress was spectacular. Always smiling, always available and understood service in a way that one doesn't often experience anymore. She made our day!",4
Great environment for a special occasion. You can have quiet conversations there and the food is good. Service is ok and not sure why we're charged 18% for just 7 people.,3
Have been before and enjoyed but his time was different.  First they tried to sit us on the terrace when the lounge was fun and hopping and the diningroom had way more atmosphere.  It wasn't that busy so not sure why they wanted us on terrace without another sole.  Waitress was lethargic and in a bad mood.  We got a happy hour menu then were told we would have to move to lounge if we wanted the deals.  So ended up paying twice as much for drinks.  So I would go for happy hour menu in lounge or special occasion upstairs.  It is a little overpriced.  $15 a glass of wine and I know I can get the bottle for $14.95.,2
"The Sunday brunch menu prices are okay if you order the $35 prix-fixe menu.  If not, the a la carte prices for the entrees are over-priced.  For instance, I had the Lobster Cobb Salad.  Its price was $29.50.  It contained uninteresting ingredients, little lobster meat, very little dressing, and a very unripe/not tasty tomato‚Ä¶.The pastry baskets included in the brunch menu were nice‚Ä¶.The shrimp tacos were good.",3
The food and the service were terrific. We sat outside on an enclosed deck which was slightly cooler than I would have preferred however all in all a very good experience.,4
"Food was delicious. Service was great. My only complaint was the ""1"" bathroom upstairs.",3
"The atmosphere is decent and I'm surprised that the food isn't better, given the neighbourhood. Definitely an overpriced menu. Service was rushed, meals were bland, dessert was an absolute joke. Will not be returning and would not recommend.",1
Lovely dining experience. Superb menu. Something for everyone. Will definately return again. Great place for large groups. Service was excellent. Lots of free parking.,3
The once dependable Miller - where you could carry on a conversation with your colleague/spouse/date - is too noisy (like nearly all Toronto bistros).,2
"We return for many reasons, one is we drive from all over the province to meet every 5 weeks, we find it easy to meet at this location, we love the food, the ambiance and most definitely the staff!",4
"Parking is an issue, the free area was full as it often is at dinner time, several 'charming' customers blocking people in because they didn't want to pay, ugghh.  
We were seated on the glassed in patio area - fantastic spot, great view and no shouting to be heard required.  The ice cream/banana/popcorn dessert dish is AMAZING!",3
"The Miller Tavern was a perfect birthday destination. Our friend was royally treated to a delicious piece of chocolate birthday cake along with six spoons for the rest of us to sample and taste. Quite clever. Our waiter was courteous, helpful and pleasant. We would love to have him again.",4
The service we received from Jeff ? Geoff was outstanding.,3
"My 2 friends and I having been meeting for lunch at this restaurant for a number of years as it it located almost in the middle of where we all live and extremely close to the 401 so that we do not have to fight city traffic. While the quality of food is excellent the real  joy of being there is spending time together. We are all retired and hence time is not the same issue for us as it is with most (?) of the other customers who appear to be having luncheon meetings. The service is great and we have never been made to feel that we have overstayed our welcome which has happened at a number of restaurants--- we just don't go back!
They have been fabulous in helping us celebrate birthdays and other important occasions and with sometimes not much notice they have accommodated special requests.
If I could change anything I would advise owners not to ""save money"" by making changes to small amenities.at not time, not so very long ago the washrooms provided napkin-style hand towels and yesterday there were no hand towels and the newly installed electric dryer didn't work. This is very far from a quick food restaurant and our bill was over $100 without any alcohol--leaving the washroom wit hands partially dried on toilet paper isn't on.
Finally, we are finding the restaurant increasingly loud particularly since they did some substantial redecorating some time ago. I do wonder if a consultation with a noise consultant would be a good idea. So far the location and service keeps us coming back.",4
"Noise level ok after we moved tables
Had a coupon so we went. Otherwise it's not worth it",2
"Great food and service. if you have a choice between lunch and dinner, you can get similar quality for much less over lunch time.",4
Great service - just a little too cold! The value is great - especially happy hour,3
Good restaurant for business meetings and group get togethers.,3
Nice place.  Two different restaurants - Upstairs is higher end and quieter.  Downstairs is less fancy - TVs on the wall etc.    Nice place but not inexpensive.,4
"The Miller Tavern has a beautiful patio, setting and surrounding are fabulous.  Service was wonderful, food delicious, ambiance is beautiful.  Thank you for a wonderful experience.  Look forward to visiting soon.......",3
The hostess Shupia went out of her way to accommodate our request for a table upstairs.  Food and ambiance were great!,4
"Food and service at the Miller Tavern are fabulous.
I was however disappointed to be seated on the main floor, even though I had made reservations.  The main floor was a little too noisy for people getting together to have dinner as the bar area was busy.  I would have expected the main floor to e reserved for walk ins.  Also, was disappointed to have to pay for parking.  Felt that the restaurant should reimburse you for the parking.",3
I return at least each month as we love everything about the restaurant. I also love the convenience of parking and to the highways as some of us come from out of town.,4
"Great menu, excellent food, but rather pricy.   Very good service.  Fantastic patio, although noise from road.   Rather dark inside restaurant.  Easy free parking right outside.   Excellent location.   Right by subway.",4
Had the seafood salad.  Was good but disappointed the shrimp were very plain with absolutely no seasoning or marinade.  Had to rely on seafood sauce.  Crab cake was very good,2
"Service was professional, food was delicious. Will be back!",4
over all satisfaction. Business guest enjoyed the restaurant and the food.,3
Good up town spot! Food consistently good. For the price portions could be a bit larger.,3
"Food was delicious, great choice. Dim sum appetiser was enjoyable, caesar salad and the jerk chicken were delicious.
The best part of the night was our waiter Ty. Literally worth going back for alone. Thank you Ty!",4
"Excellently food and service. A local favorite which we enjoy. A varied menu is available and lots
of appealing choices.",4
"A Great place to meet friends, we had a wonderful spot on balcony  upstairs.       Service was well timed and friendly.  The cob salad was light and fresh, a perfect dish for a warm summer evening.  Our friends enjoyed the salmon and steak dish which was well presented. 

Looking forward to our next meal at the Miller Tavern.",4
"Terrible service..waiter seemed rushed..waiter brought one of the  main dishes and forgot the other..realized anout 10 min after when I hadnt started eating..took back the doah anf came back woth bith entrees later..offered  a complimentary drink to make up for it..

Had ti carey iur own drinks from bar to patio..sefinitely nit a 4 or 5 star place...food was ok..nothing specatacular",2
"I have been enjoying the Miller Tavern for many years. I initially went there because of it's historical significance.  I continue to go because the food is always delicious, and the staff are warm, friendly and very efficient. The atmosphere is lovely, and in the summer their patio is delightful.
It is my first choice if I want to entertain friends, and I am always very proud to take a friend there who is from out of town.",4
"Had to send centre cut sirloin back because it was too tough.  Replaced it with a more expensive tenderloin and paid for the upgrade (which was quite a bit).
My husband's Pad Thai was fine.
House wine was a Beaujolais which was fine.

Nice touch to provide a welcome small glass of wine because it was our anniversary but it was more of a dessert wine - not the best to start off with  - however, the thought was right, thank-you,  just needed better execution with the product.",2
"We made a reservation for the patio only to find they had no table. We took an alternate space temporarily only to have to ask after Drinks and appetizers for our table and were met with blank stares. The Steak Frites was terrible. Rubbery and over tenderized. 
This use to be a favorite for a special occasion but they seem to have lost their way.",0
"I am hoping I don't have to fill out the rest of the form, I come back each month, driving for 3/4 of an hour to get there as everything is always perfect. I wouldn't keep returning if I didn't love it.
Disappointed I had to fill out the other stuff.",4
"For the cost, the food at the Miller Tavern is nothing special. Thr atmosphere is like a roadhouse with tv screens throughout. It's also quite noisy and we will not be returning.",3
"Service was a little fast but the food was great. our server was attentive and knew the menu. 
very enjoyable evening",3
"Had a great time on a first date.  Peter, our host, was friendly, polite, and helpful explaining our choices of food and drink.  Would definitely recommend to anyone.",4
"We have reserved a table at Miller Tavern to celebrate birthday for one of our family members. Unfortunately our long awaited great expectations from this restaurant did not materialize. Nothing good could be said about the place, food or service, except convenient online reservation. The quality of food was really poor, not tasty at all. Sangria cocktail appeared to be a mix of water with little bit juice. The staff is poorly trained - we spent there more than 1 hour, and waiter asked us if we need something else only when we decided to leave the place. Finally my wife had a serious stomach problem and nausea upon return at home. At looks like food was not fresh...
Do not advice anybody to visit this place. Does not worth money and time spent there...",0
You should hire more staff.,2
"The venue is very nice, lots of space, comfortable seating, a great looking patio. The rest is kind of average. Went with my boyfriend for his birthday dinner. Got a shared appetizer plate that had shrimp, crab cakes, spring rolls and pita bread. It was okay, nothing special. The presentation leaves something to be desired. For entrees he got surf and turf and I got steak frites. The steak was tasty and cooked just as we ordered it. The fries were crispy but not overly flavourful. BF was happy with the lobster tail. These were the best dishes of the night. Dessert was disappointing. BF got the chunky monkey which had more bananas than ice cream in it and I got a lemon tart. The tart had clearly just come out of the fridge, and the filling was overly sweet and not all that lemony. 

Service started well but it took forever for the server to come clear our entrees and give us the dessert menu. 

One plus is that they serve my favourite white wine - Cave Spring Riesling Dolomite. The wine selection and happy hour bar menu is probably the best thing about this place.

The total cost before tip (app, 2 entrees, 2 dessert, 1 glass of wine) was $120. It's close by so I might so back for steak frites and wine, but I'd get dessert elsewhere.",2
"Food was okay but nothing spectacular. No vegetables served with steak. Had to pay extra for stale bread.  Poor value for money when compared with restaurants of same price range.
The bus boy was a real pain in the neck. He kept coming over, trying to remove our plates before we were finished and watched us eating. Terrible and unacceptable.
The waiter was very nice and brought us a piece of birthday cake.
Won't be back for some time.
Disappointing.",1
My husband and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary at the Miller Tavern and we had a great time! Our sever was friendly and professional and the food was delish! We will be celebrating many more special occasions here! Thanks for a great memory :),4
we always love returning to The Miller tavern. The food is consistently good. meats are cooked to your liking. wait staff are gracious. food is served in a timely fashion. the menu is diverse. plenty to choose from. the portions are good sizes. We look forward to our next visit.,4
Terrible service. Inside of restaurant feels old and dirty. Terrible service. Almost one and a half hours wait for dinner!,1
Great surroundings as expected. Food was not as good as anticipated. Basically pub grub,3
"Good was very good
Too loud in the bar area",3
"We sat on the patio which was nice. The staff were efficient and friendly. The lobster that came with the salad was like rubber and my wife buried it so as not to make our friends, who had invited us, feel bad. The salad itself was lackluster and thrown together.  My burger and fries was tasty but at $23 was no better than the $11 ones I get anywhere else. My caesar (drink) was nice, and my friend enjoyed a cold draft beer. The desserts were average and the coffee was ok. The prix fixe made the price more palatable but still not worth the price.",1
Found the pricing quite aggressive for what is standard  fare but prepared well.,2
"A great location.  Muskoka chairs lined up outside, a fab spot to wait for a lunch date.  Food is consistently good.  Lots of choice for drinks and always good service.",3
"The Miller Tavern was the site of our 50th wedding anniversary dinner. It produced a memorable meal complete with complementary ""bubbly"" and restricted diet (lactose intolerant) dessert. The waiter was super attentive and friendly - about as good as a waiter can get. The food (pickerel and filet mignon in stilton cheese) was done to perfection. My wife is already talking about coming back for next year's anniversary rather than waiting for a ""special"" anniversary such as our 55th or 60th.",4
"Service was great until our server went missing for about 20 minutes, thus we didn't order dessert.",3
"Peter our server was the best. So efficient and happy. Felt right at home with Peter. Awesome guy made our night so memorable. Can't wait to come back. Hopefully, Peter is our server again.",4
"This is my ""go to"" places for business meals.  I have never been disappointed.   It is especially wonderful to be able to sit in the patio section and enjoy our ever so brief summer.",4
"We live in the neighbourhood and go to Millers on a regular basis and usually have nothing but good things to say .Booked a reservation and noted in the comments it was for a birthday celebration.the hostess seated us and we waited for 10mins and the sever never came by. Got up and asked the hostess to send our server over. He came by and gave us water. We asked for the steak menu,which the hostess had not given us. Then waited another 10mins and had to wave down the server to place our order. The patio was not overly busy,so no reason for the terrible service on a Wednesday night.Food arrived and was excellent! Sever came by as our mouth was full to check how our meal was (this was the only time he checked on us) We finished and sat at the table with our server and others going by,yet no one cleared our plates.  We were not offered another drink or dessert. At this point we were so aggravated that when we saw our server was taking the next tables order , I asked for the bill without ordering dessert( which we always order)He stopped to chat with other colleagues and came back 5 mins later.  We paid the bill and left,plates were still not cleared. We expressed the disappointment in service to the server,but he did nothing. The service was an EPIC FAIL! Not sure if we will return to this neighbourhood favourite, as we were highly disappointed and a birthday celebration was ruined by horrible service.",1
"Terrible service although our waitress was trying. Very understaffed. She did give us a complimentary drink at the emd of the evening but it was too late as we had all we wanted to drink. Lobster Cobb Salad was below average with iceberg lettuce that was turning brown. Don't order the pot sticker basket as apparently it takes much longer to prepare although I think an hour is a  little beyond ""much longer""! I never write reviews but felt this one was necessary.",0
"You no longer have the lobster quesadilla as a full course.I specifically came for this.

 I ordered the lobster roll, and it all roll, very little filling.The accompanying chips were great.

White wine sangria was weak.

The server was fantastic!

Overall disappointed in what used to be my favourite pub. Years ago, the Miller was my parents

 fave pub!",2
Poor service combined with blah food at 50$/pperson without alcohol the owner'sowner's car was parked in the only accessible parking space.,1
Service was indifferent. Food ok. Somewhat disappointing given many past meals @ The Miller Tavern - each of the other meals were good.  Would of thought a Wednesday evening would result in great service. May try one more time.,2
"The outdoor patio was great except ask for a table away from the Yonge street side; the traffic noise was disturbing. Food was excellent, had the daily Pickerel special with cousccous and it was perfect",4
"Nice menu, good service.  One of our entrees was Steak Oscar.  We thought for the $49 price we'd have more of the Oscar topping on the steak.    The Caesar (drink) was a bit heavy on tobacco.  Other menu items were good.",2
"Noted in my reservation that we were celebrating a special occasion, and we received complimentary sparkling wine and dessert wine! Our server was very nice, friendly and attentive.",4
"Only went as it was my BDay & had a promo $25 gift certificate for moving into the neighbourhood. The weather was nice, so picked the patio. Server never introduced himself nor the daily specials. Never bothered to refill our glasses of water until we asked twice, then of I got tired of asking. I guess it was a hint to order some drinks from the menu. I normally order wine with my steak but I had a cold & could only savour part of the stronger flavoured foods. Never asked us if he got our orders right & if our steaks were cooked correctly. He was very eager to ask if we had finished our meals & if we would like dessert. Had to ask what the dessert daily special was. As none of the desserts were prepared in house, we elected not to order any & asked for the bill which included 2 items, 1 of which we cancelled & the other which was ""automatically included if we order the first one""!?! He still asked us if we wanted tea or coffee even though I said, ""nothing except the bill, thanks."" Never mentioned my BDay which was in the special requests of our reservation. My wife liked her steak but at the price, nothing a steakhouse up the hill couldn't easily offer at the same price & quality but with better service. So despite the fact that we had high hopes of making this restaurant OUR restaurant as it is literally a 3 minute walk from our new front  door, we will definitely NOT be coming back and would NOT recommend it to anyone else, especially as we had to tip for such poor service & to listen to another waiter grumble about his guests & watch him wash his leg with water from one the pitchers in front of me, yuck! Rick, you're definitely going to need a lot of help training the attitudes of your service staff.",2
Gorgeous patio. Disappointed with the food.,2
"Chaotic and disorganized service disappointed us, despite nice and charming setting, on patio at lunchtime.",2
"Patio was wonderful. We stayed for hours. Weren't rushed out. 
The smoked chicken pappardelle was tasty but much too heavy.",4
"This is a staple in my ""go to"" places.  Great menu, great staff.  It is especially a delight in the summer when you can sit out on the patio.  Dependable.  No surprises.",4
"The service was incredibly slow. Put a real damper on an important evening. 
Peter, the manager was incredibly lovely about it and ensured that our evening ended on an upnote.  The food is delicious and the atmosphere is lovely - hoping this was a one off incident as we have been there many times before and have always had a lovely experience.",1
"We sat outside on the patio mid-day and it was a gorgeous patio. The  traffic driving by was a bit loud, but that it outside of anyone's control :) I had the jalapeno burger and it was very spicy and delicious - alongside the Cesar salad. Great place for business lunches.",3
"Mediocre food and service at brunch, but would give it another chance for dinner because of the fabulous patio.",2
Lovely three-leveled patio with some real style.   My favourite area is the lower patio.,3
The patio is amazing üòÄ,4
All around the Miller tavern was perfect! It was my friend's first time and I wanted to take her somewhere special for her birthday.She  was so thrilled with everything. Delicious food for a great price! My friends are recommending it to everyone and I'm definitely  coming again!!,4
"Always a great dining experience. A suggestion- since the patio is so popular, saving a few prime tables for those with a res would be most appreciated. We had a res, were seated in an uncomfortably sunny spot and even though I made it known to the greeter that I would prefer an alternate table, I had to keep an eye out for another table and requested to be moved when a more suitable one became available. The current table assignment process is in need of improvement.",3
"We had great service from our waiter, Jeff!!",4
Good bill of fare and a good variety of entr√©es.,3
Valentines,3
"I have been a couple of times in here. I was satisfied whenever I came to. However, I had no chances to enjoy the patio's seat although I had asked to book a patio's table unfortunately. I would have been happy if I got a table in the patio.",3
Smoked Chicken Pappardelle was terrible.  2 people at our table sent it back,2
"Met with a couple of colleagues.  They put us on the patio which had a nice view and nice ambiance.  I had the calamari which was excellent along with a Manhattan - yummy!  I had the seafood pad thai which wasnt that spicy but flavourful.  Overall, a good choice for a partner meeting!",4
"Two concerns:

In as much as we loved the ambiance and feature of the upstairs patio, it was upsetting to smell cigarette smoke from below. Perhaps a designated area away from diners at the far end of the restaurant. 

Secondly, we expected to have our server move our drinks and menus when we requested to move tables; not having to lug our drinks, belongings and menus on our own. 

We've dined here several times and always have an overall excellent experience. 
Thx
G&G",4
"Upon arriving we were told our reservation for our family brunch was in the Lounge area which is a very dark sports bar with televisions blaring and loud music playing. Not the atmosphere I wanted nor expected. I've had lunch and dinner in the dining room which is an elegant area. This is what I was expecting.  I wish I had  been told when making the brunch reservation that it was in the bar area and not in the dining room, I would have made other plans.  When we explained we didn't want to sit in the bar, we were given the option of the patio. It was just past noon and the patio was still quiet. We arrived at the outside hostess stand to be greeted by a gentleman who told us there were no tables available. Two large ones had reserved signs.  I know from history that you cannot reserve patio tables and mentioned this. I was told yes that was the policy however they did take these too.  Needless to say I wasn't impressed. We were told we could sit in the Patio's upper lounge area.  Decorated with couches not tables, this wasn't what we wanted but at this stage we had no choice. My 80 year old inlaws were getting anxious to sit. As we were going upstairs the gentleman suddenly changed  his mind and sat us at one of the reserved tables, making a big deal out of wanting to help us. Frankly this should've been done right away for us. The most positive part of our visit was the staff who did their best to make up for slow bar/food service.  Overall the meals were mediocre.  Two of us had Eggs Benedict which was served on rock hard biscuits that couldn't  be cut with a knife.  After lunch we were asked about dessert which we passed on. We were then told that dessert was part of the Prix Fix and asked if we wanted it to go.  At no point were we told that brunch was only Prix Fix.  As items were priced individually we assumed we had the option to order individually. This really cemented what an overall terrible experience we had had.  Not going to be visiting again.",1
"only one server for whole balcony

soup was spilled on my wife - no attempt to clean her blouse

wine bottle was never attended to

food was way below expectation

no offer of dessert menu or coffee

payment terminal did not function",2
"Fun atmosphere, great service and the seafood salad plate was delicious as always. One of my favourite haunts in North Toronto. I prefer the dining room upstairs to the sports bar setting on the ground level. On warm sunny days who can resist the veranda or the patio?",3
"Our waiter, Willy did an outstanding job and was very attentive . We enjoyed our lunch very much.",4
"We went for the Prix Fixe Mother's Day brunch. The service was great, very attentive and prompt. Food was delish and came out in very reasonable time despite it being a very busy day. Started off with perfectly spiced Caesars. The crab cake and eggs benny was amazing. Promo champagne for Mother's Day was a nice bonus. The custard in the vanilla creme brulee could have been warmer, but otherwise delicious. Great value - all this plus coffee, including the alcoholic beverage for 35$!  We'll be back.",4
"We were seated in the dining area with all glass that overlooked the park.  Service was very good, sometimes overdone - however, the order in which our drinks and food arrived were a little out of sync, but the waiter quickly resolved this by bringing more food.

Very good quality food and well prepared.  They also didn't mind switching up meals with different vegetable accompaniments.

Overall we had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed the food and ambience.

We plan to go there again very soon",3
"The food was excellent with a great atmosphere to catch up with friends. The service was slow with a server who had no interest in taking our order, clearing dishes, asking us if we wanted dessert or providing us with our bill. Ver dissappointing.",2
"Great atmosphere. Lots of activity at the bar when we walked in. Upstairs to the restaurant, gives you good views over the park, particularly if you sit in the enclosed patio.  
Apps, we had the platter. The crab cakes were unfortunately somewhat tasteless.  For a lot of fried foods, the upside is that things weren't particularly greasy.
I had the steak frittes with lobster tail.  My wife the steak frittes.  The steak was chefs choice (he chose sirloin). I've had few ""great steaks"" in my life. This wasn't one of them. It wasn't bad, just a piece of meat.  The lobster tail was good. Skipped desert. A little expensive for the food, but not ridiculous. I wouldn't say don't go, but neither would I say you have to go.",2
"Howie is a fantastic server.
I would come back just for him.
Although the food and ambiance was excellent.",4
The food is always great and the server was very friendly and accommodating.,4
"Atmosphere was  very nice, staff was friendly but not outstanding, food was mediocre given the cost",2
"Great new manu, food was extremely well done",4
"We had nice experience before so we chose this restaurant to celebrate a few work anniversaries.  Several beef dishes were great. But one Pad Thai was so salty that we had to return it.  They allow the person to swap for a chicken salad, but it was not good either.  The Ahi Tuna was so-so quality, with  non  crispy nacho underneath.  That dish with 4 pcs of tiny seared tuna 2""*2"" each was definitely over-priced @$33.  Service was good though.",1
"It's our third time coming here all for special occasions. First time when we bought our first place together, then when we got pregnant and this time for our first anniversary. We brought out 2 month old little girl. Everything was perfect. The waiter bought us a couple celebration cocktails as well. I had the surf and turf special which was perfect. My wife had the prime rib which was amazing as well.",4
Although it is quite expensive it is well worth it. The food was delicious and the selection was good as well,4
"Our server Nick was very good, overall a good experience, will return",3
The Miller has an extensive and varied menu that is supplemented by a daily lunch menu. It is hard not to find something that you like and something that tastes good.,3
$5.25 apps and drinks during happy hour (2 pm - 5 pm). Amazing selection on bothq,4
Good local spot but the downstairs is quite loud and the TV's distracting. We didn't move upstairs due to mobility issues for one of us. Will try that next time.,3
"I through in a special request regarding my anniversary. As soon as my girlfriend went to the washroom the waiter came by and said ""I have got your message in your reservation and I just want to let you know I will be taking care of you tonight"". After we finished the main course, he had brought over a delicious desert and 2 shots on the house. Great staff, environment, and food was phenomenal. Going back for sure. The only downside to our night was 3 extremely loud guests sitting next to us who were  conversing really loud and in deep thought and at one point arguing. It was so loud that my girlfriend and I really did not get a chance to have a conversation amongst ourselves until they left midway through our meal. It was unfortunate but  not the restaurants fault and will be going back again because of this.",3
"The food is really impressive in taste, quality and presentation.

The service is outstanding.

Very accommodating wine list and a lot of creatives cocktails.

A great evening for two or for a big family or  a bunch of friends",4
"Haven't been to this establishment in about 20 years, and it sure has changed.  Very nice d√©cor, great food and the service was excellent.  A very good menu and delicious draught selection bring this tavern to the next level.  Won't be waiting so long for my next visit.",4
"It was a disappointment to discover that, against the background of a check of around $200.00 for a couple, we were charged $3.50 for bread and one small slice of butter (which we had to ask for). Some restaurants only provide bread upon request, which is understandable, as a means to cut down on otherwise unnecessary expense and waste. You are overdoing it a little.
Nevertheless we enjoy the Miller, and have been coming in on a regular basis.",3
"The Miller has a great lunch menu with delicious specials to complement the extensive regular menu.
A great spot for a business lunch or with friends or family.",3
Alex was exceptional as a waiter. The halibut was over cooked and disappointing. The steak was wonderful. Overall a great evening.,3
We wanted an easy place for out of town friends to meet us for Sunday lunch. It was perfect. Tasty food. Very nice waiter. Easy and plentiful parking.,4
"Average quality food. Interior. Is a little rough around the edges, could use some work. Prices, both alcohol and food, are way to high; poor value for the money.",1
The food was delicious.     The ambiance on the terrace was very pleasant.     Server was friendly and helpful.    We would definitely recommend The Miller Tavern to our friends.,4
"Our server was great, but that's where all the good stuff ends. One of the meals was overcooked. The steak was tough and had no taste. A big disappointment. I've been here a number of times and have found my experience to be the same. The food is overpriced and tasteless. So many other restaurants in Toronto I can't help but recommend to not go here. I'm usually one to find the positive, missing since however, is a tough thing to do",0
"Whenever I come to Toronto, I take my folks & the rest of the family here for either lunch or a special dinner. We are always made to feel very welcome, & well taken care of. The food is always great, & our servers always friendly & helpful! If it's been a special occasion, we've been treated to a lovely dessert too!",4
"The lobster salad was delicious. You can bring your own wine for reasonable corkage, which we did. Good spot!",3
The new menu has a lot more options and is more reasonably priced. I'd be more likely to go back more often with this new menu.,2
"We were two couples there for a Valentine's Day, dinner. Server took a while to get to us to take our drink order, but we weren't ready when she arrived (admittedly our fault) so the server said she would be back. It was another 10-15 minutes later before a different server came back to take our drink and dinner order. Drinks came quickly, but the food was another 45 minutes before we were served. Both couples ordered the same Valentine's Day seafood platter special for two. When the platters were served, one platter had two dipping sauces, while the other platter had none. Rather than request our own sauce, they other couple shared their second sauce. Maybe one of the two dipping sauces on the one platter was for the other platter, but it would have been nice for staff to say so.

After 90 minutes or so, the service staff were more than able to meet our requests in a timely fashion (water, more drinks, etc), but by this time, many of the tables had already finished up and left. We weren't in any hurry, but the place that night seemed a bit under-staffed. Maybe they didn't expect the number of tables they actually had that night (I booked with the Open Table app without issue about a week earlier). 

Overall, the food was okay, not great, and because of the short staffing (or so it would appear), the service was a bit less than okay. I've been here many times before and will likely be here again. Generally, I liked everything about Millers in Hogg's Hollow, but tonight was a bit disappointing and certainly could have been better.",2
"The environment setting is not bad, could be better.  We were put at a table for two but actually there are bench seats still available. The table for tow seems a little bit small if order more food such as appetizer.  The parking lot is a bit small.  I was surprised that it was full and I have to park at the Go train parking lot and paid for it.  Overall, the experience it not bad.",2
"The old Jolly Miller, this restaurant/bar is great for just hanging out at the bar downstairs or having a great dinner upstairs. The restaurant menu has many diverse choices that offer a multitude of options for all discerning palettes. Their wine list also offers quite a wide variety of quality bottles ranging at various price points.",4
"My only complaint is that I reserved our table three weeks in advance and we were sat closest to the kitchen entrance . I was there on celebrating Valentine's Day and I could hear more wait staff banter and horsing around than I could my fiance . 

Next time I'll be sure to request we are not seated near the bar or kitchen entrance.",2
"Our family gathered on the anniversary of my father's passing, choosing the the Miller Tavern because it was familiar and liked by my parents.  I don't know if the staff knew the significance of our gathering or if it was because it was Valentine's day but they presented us with a complimentary starter (deep fried goat cheese, very nice) and a dessert coffee shooter (coffee, maple syrup with whipped cream, meh).  The offering of these perks were very formal but the rest of the service was too casual and intimate.  Our waiter used a pet name when speaking to us (boss, darling, mom) and joined in on our conversations.  Even though it was a lunch we gathered for and a casual atmosphere is expected to a degree it was beyond our comfort level.

Everyone was very happy with their order.  Our group included food allergies which were accommodated without compromise.  

Near the end of our meal a bleach odor swept over us.  The source was unknown to us and did not pass before we left - in fact we wrapped up and left more quickly than we might have if the odor had dissipated.  

With all this said and a mediocre rating I would return.  It wasn't our first visit.  This review is only a reflection of this recent visit.",2
Winterlicious was good value. Otherwise it is overpriced for what you get. Service was slow.,1
"We were a group of 4, first time diners here.we made reservations. Extensive wine list, nice ambiance, we were seated in the solarium. Our server was attentive and very personable. As for the menu, there was only 1 chicken dish and only 1 vegetarian dish to offer. Considering the price of  the meals, they lacked presentation. We had prime rib and surf and turf dishes . I would say ,considering it a fine dining restaurant, the meals were somewhat disappointing. You pay for the location. I would consider another restaurant before returning here. Not bad, just didn't meet my expectations .",2
"We had come here over the weekend for a birthday, and unfortunately the food was not even remotely decent.  The bread was stale, the soup and the main dinner was not hot or fresh and it tasted as though it had been microwaved.  The waiter was attentive despite the food being an absolute waste.  If you want a quality meal go elsewhere and save your money.  This place is definetly not worth the $",0
"Went their for Sunday brunch.  Found they had several brunch options going on so we were able to choose exactly what we wanted off several menus.  Also, a price break on wine and some cocktails.  Our waitress was very good and did not mind coming over many times as we waded thru our options.",3
"I keep returning to this place for my business lunches and have never been disappointed.   Great menu, great ambience.   I like the fact that the tables are spaced well apart, which allows for unhindered discussions.  In too many places they pack them in, and you feel part of the discussion at the next table!",4
"We went to Miller Tavern for my mother's birthday. The experience was amazing. Food was delis and the service was very good. They gave my mother a complimentary fondue for her birthday. I thought that was really nice and different. The prices were affordable and they have parking lot, which is very convenient.  I will definitely will be returning to this place for other occasions. Just one thing tho, the pad thai  was small serving, it wasn't enough for a starving person I had to steal other people's food üòÅ.  But other than that the overall experience would be an 8 for me. Thank you Miller Tavern for making my mother's bday special. She enjoyed it ( and she's very picky when it comes to food and restaurant). So this is huge.",3
"We went there on a Friday night to grab a bite to eat.  Both us had a steak craving and it was easy to book a table (Thanks OPENTABLE) and it's easy to park here.  I ordered the Prime Rib, my wife ordered a steak kabob.  Neither of us had a side, neitehr of us had a salad.  Total bill??? $78 before tip!!!!

This was my last time there.  The food was fine.  It didn't compare with any other place in the city with a similar menu.  There are much better places to go where your hard earned dollar will go much farther.",1
Service was fantastic! Food was overpriced. Everything seemed overcooked or under seasoned. Our group of 10 ordered mainly steak and fish.  The best looking meal at the table was the hamburger.,2
"We had previously had a good (but expensive) dinner at the downtown location last fall, but this experience was very disappointing. The tenderloin steak kebab for $32 was very tough and not very tasty, even though it had been marinated. When asked if I wanted the seafood pad Thai regular or spicy, I asked for spicy and got regular. The squash salad was overpriced for a bit of lettuce and squash. We won't go back.",1
The Miller has always been a go-to dinner spot for a group of 4 friends coming from different directions.  We've been going there for years.  Sadly it's gradually becoming very pricey.  We have always enjoyed the ambience but were seated downstairs (not nearly as nice) and felt compelled to do the soup and salad thing to keep the cost down.,2
We went for New Years Eve meal with friends. The service was very good considering how busy they were. The only one minor gaffe was my wife's and her friends steaks were not cooked to their liking. The waiter was fantastic - they had new steaks on the table in 10 minutes with a sincere apology. We were more than satisfied with their actions however they also sent us complementary shooters and a mixed fruit chocolate fondue to share. Great recovery and we were very impressed. Mistakes happen how you deal with them is the key .,3
"We went there for a quick supper New Years Eve, and everything was fine.  The service was excellent, as always.  We were slightly disappointed that there were only two choices of oysters available, but that was due to weather/delivery issues beyond the restaurnt's control, apparently.  The menu is a bit top heavy with steaks and somewhat pricey over all compared to our last visit, over a year ago.  My wife just had the fish tacos as a main and she liked them.  I had the chicken breast, and it was superb!",4
"I made a reservation for 9:00pm on Saturday, Dec. 26th. I received a phone call earlier that day notifying me that the veranda and upstairs floor will be closed off. I requested the veranda,  but it was fine as long as we still had seats. The hostess said of course since we had a reservation. I was 15 minutes late but my party was already there and seated but were told that they may not be able to accommodate us since last call is at 9:30 and it will take approx. 25 minutes to make our food. To top it off, they were closing at 10:00pm. NO ONE mentioned this to me when I placed the reservation or when they called me earlier that day. If this is the case, they should have never accepted the reservation at 9:00pm in the first place or made sure that we knew this. Normally they close at 12:00am on Saturdays. Technically based on those times, we could have still stayed and ordered but the waitress was trying to hint that we'd be rushed. The waitress was very apologetic and tried her best to help us find another restaurant/bar to relocate to. However, even with her efforts this has been a horrible experience.",0
Getting to The Miller was good. Parking was a disaster. The service was very good and our lunch choices were served in a very timely manner. Due to it being the Christmas season it was super busy.,3
"Not my first time at the Miller Tavern and again totally enjoyed the dinner.  Our waiter was amazing, tentative but not intrusive.  The food was excellent.  Although the menu tends to lean towards beef the chicken dinner as well as the Pad Thai were cooked to perfection.  The noise level in the bar area was high but it is the week before Xmas so to be expected.  We sat upstairs and it was not as noisy and easy to hear table conversation.  We were celebrating a birthday and we plan to return in the summer to enjoy the patio.",4
table had a gum stuck right on middle top surface of table...,1
consistently good food and service.  really enjoy the special extras they provide with your meal - drink replacements and daily app.,3
"We had a lovely dinner - everyone enjoyed the entire experience - and our waiter was excellent, just taking it up another notch.  The atmosphere was great and did not feel at all rushed - we had a great, long dinner together and are planning on returning.",3
"My girlfriend  was running late. No problems waiting at reserved table.Felt  very welcome from 
our waiter. Checked  on me frequently and offered beverages while waiting on her arrival.
Dinner service was relaxed and gave us plenty of time to visit and enjoy  the surroundings and the food which was exceptional.
Would most definitely book another meal at this restaurant.",4
The Miller is my favorite neighbourhood restaurant - good service and greta atmosphere - the food is always very good.,3
"We had the roast beef dip. Meat, dip and fries were great but it came in a hamburger bun; I would have preferred it with the traditional hard crust bread. They carry my favourite Beau's Lug Tread; a nice change from the bland corporate beers that are typically exclusively on offer in this type of restaurant. I thought the minimum suggested tip of 18% was a little pretentious. Conveniently located and friendly. Will return again.",2
"Good service, great food, nice atmosphere.  What more could you want?",4
"A wonderful evening to celebrate my wife's 70th Birthday with my adult children. The food and service was impeccable. Our waitperson, Howie, set a leisurely pace so that we enjoyed each course to the fullest. He orchestrated a superb dining experience for our family that we will all remember.  Kudos to Howie and the dining room staff.",3
Despite the noise level (they really gotta do something about this) Miller is a reliable place and a good value considering the portions (generous) and service (attentive without interrupting).,2
Been here on numerous occasions and it's aways a pleasure,4
"EXPENSIVE GIVEN THE POOR QUALITY  OF THE FOOD , HAVE BEEN THERE A FEW TIMES IN THE LAST FEW YEARS  WAS ALWAY OK .  NO SURPRISES .",1
"We have lived in the area for several years and had never been there but after this experience it will be one of our prime destinations . We were celebrating our 42nd anniversary with friends. The  four of us had the surf and turf, portion and taste was great. Our server,  Howie  was fabulous. We will be back",4
"good neighborhood restaurant , pleasing menu  at reasonable price ...service left a lot to be desired in a half empty section we were in ....but expectation was that we still leave a reasonable tip.",2
We return every month as we love everything.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,4
"An excellent experience at the Miller Tavern for Sunday lunch.  Easy to park close to the door.  Good access to restaurant.  Good food - Truffled eggs with asparagus, poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, mushroom ravioli.  All very pallatable for a senior citizen",3
This was our first time at the Miller Tavern and we were not disappointed. The food and wine selection was excellent. Our waiter was attentive but not overbearing and looked after our every need. This was important as a couple of out group had dietary concerns. Would definitely return.,3
"Everything from recognizing the reservation, to being seated promptly, to attentive service, was right on. Equally important--the food is uniformly tasty, and well presented. This is a neighbourhood restaurant that we go back to frequently because it delivers every time",4
"We've been several times over recent years,  and generally had a decent experience for a fine-dining establishment, as the Miller Tavern wants to be.    But I think the Miller is relying too much on its previous reputation and has now got a bit flabby and complacent.    
The food was not  bad,  but it wasn't especially... special.    The crabcakes starter was bread-y and far overcooked.    My NY strip arrived pretty rare, for a  requested mid-rare/medium.  (No, I didn't send it back - I'm Canadian.)  But it was flavourful, and I ate most of it.   The lemon/berry shortbread tart came without any advertised berries (and no explanation),  and its crust was exceptionally ""fridge-y"" from having been stored for days uncovered along with onions, etc.   
The biggest complaint is the service.   The last couple of times, the server has been all over us - friendly to the point of being obsequious  (bringing ""comped"" desserts without even allowing us to order our own desserts from the menu.)   On this last visit, our waitress practically sighed as she approached our table.   She took our order, then we only saw her once again,  until she brought the bill - before that, she came by with the obligatory free ""novelty shooter""/ tip bait.  All other table functions were provided by the kind but overreaching busser  and a shift manager.    After the waitress dropped off the bill,  she never came back.   Another waitress passing by noticed us, and took the initiative to get the credit-card reader.
Dinner for two, with wine and tip, approached $ 300 - and we don't mind spending that for a memorable experience.    But, we felt no more appreciated than if we'd popped into a roadhouse for a bite before a move - just another ""cover"" on a Monday night.",1
I love the Miller Tavern however much prefer upstairs and the downstairs is very noisy.,4
Hosted a party of four. We had an outstanding meal and a very pleasant time. We shall definitely return and are happy to recommend this restaurant to all our friends.,4
"Fantastic evening with family celebrating my birthday.  Howie, our server was amazing, attentive & knowledgeable about menu questions. I chose Arctic Char when he explained that it was farmed at Guelph Univ and was very pleased with my selection. The rest of he family enjoyed their steak, it was quite filling. My daughter was the only one to have the wine so cannot comment on wine list. Also, we sat on the veranda and did not observe the bar scene. Parking lot was full so we had to use paid parking lot beside restaurant.",3
"I'm a regular at this place - I can't say that about any other restaurant.  I've always been treated exceptionally well and truthfully I have never had a bad meal there or even bad service so I like that they have consistent excellence in what they do.  The food is always inventive and the portions are large.  The ambience is great and the different areas of the restaurant are great- bar scene and casual or more formal upstairs.  I can never find a criticism of this place.

One small thing however - those Visa machines for payment should not be fixed at tips that start at 18% and up.  The service is superlative but I do take an issue with the assumption a tip starts at 18%.  The waiters there are great but that should be changed back to 15%.  We are tipping on tax amounts so 18% is too much for some.",4
"Very disappointed that the sun porch upstairs is closed. That's what makes The Miller Tarvan so unique and beautiful. There are many great places for brunch in Toronto, but only Miller has such a beautiful sun room.",1
"I like this place a lot, close to home, free parking, decent food, great services. I always ask to be seated at their glasses patio, which is opened even during winter!! Last time I was there, I was under a very strict diet, they were able to make all the food according to my restrictions and still came out delicious and enjoyable to eat!  One of my fave spots!",4
"I return, sometimes twice a month because I love everything about the occasion. You have the best staff, food and comfort.",4
"The Miller is a neighbourhood gem.  The food never disappoints, however, usually we find that the noise level at lunch, whether inside or on the porch, rises quite high and sometimes it is difficult to have good conversation with your lunch partner.  But that won't stop us from returning.",3
I had a business meeting at the miller and was impressed with the attention to detail with respect to location and level of service... food as always was excellent,4
"This was not the old Miller i rememberer , that was a roadhouse bar.

The food was great top self , fresh, great presentation professionally delivered by the wait staff.

the servers was perfect always available without smothering you no hurrying . i would 

\recommend the new Miller with no hesitation.",4
"service was top notch---food was excellent as usual--wine list offers some excellent, reasonably priced alternatives--all together made for a wonderful birthday celebration for  our daughter",3
"We keep returning each month because we love it. We noticed the noise level this time, but couldn't think of a solution. We wondered about trying dowstairs for a change. We do love the outdoors feeling up on the porch.",4
"We enjoyed a delicious turkey dinner with all the fixings complete with an excellent pumpkin cheesecake and vanilla cr√®me Brule.  Service was excellent. Decided to have an early dinner so we could get home for the Blue Jay's game so lots of families there celebrating Thanksgiving so it was a little noisier than it would normally be.  Waiter was great.  Service good.
Definitely go back again.",3
Great way to enjoy a yummy turkey dinner with family.  Very good every year.,3
"The dining experience on a whole was very good.  However, I booked a table on the verandah days in advance and followed up with a phone call and when I arrived I was told that there was no table on the the verandah.  I was stuck in a booth  then finally moved to a table on the verandah that was in the way of all the servers.  The service was good and very polite and the food was great..  

The Miller Tavern is still a fun place to go and I would recommend it.  However, the management of the tables is not great.",3
"I've been to the Miller Tavern many times over the decades but never for a special occasion.  The service was fantastic.  Our server Elizabeth was amazing.  The seafood appetizers were a bit disappointing, especially the tun tacos, but the meat dishes were done to perfection.",3
"The food was very disappointing. It had been a long time since I've been to this location and the food wasn't that bad before. I had the Tuna entree and it was not good. It was swimming in the mash and various sauces....it was a sloppy mess. 

The Bay Street location is far superior. Not likely to return to the Yonge street location. Service was slow as well.",1
"We have been coming to the Miller for years now and it never fails to impress. Cheerful, friendly  and professional service always. The menu has a wide enough selection without being overwhelming. The classics or a variation of classic are always there if you're not feeling adventurous. There are more adventurous items too. This latest experience was on a busy Friday night with two big groups. The atmosphere was still special and not too loud. Had we sat on the veranda, it would have been quieter, which is a nice option if you are looking for more low-key. We had a lovely Shiraz, caesar salads, bread, Stilton blue cheese filet mignons and sticky toffee pudding - everything was superb and our hats off to the chefs.",4
The service at the Miller is exceptional. The servers are always attentive without being imposing. Food is consistently good and you never feel rushed when you're catching up with old friends when you eat there.,3
"My experience at Miller's Tavern was overall decent. For the price of the food, the food was standard. My friends and I look like a younger crowd so maybe the server didn't take us seriously but he took forever to take our orders. When we finally got our orders about half of them came out wrong which was disappointing. The overall experience was satisfactory. On a plus note, the one dollar lobster option was awesome!",1
"Always great to be on the patio- a few mosquitos later at night but quite manageable.
Was a birthday party for 10. Service was quite personable, with the manager Peter coming several times to add to the festivities- he is great. The filet mignons center cut was quite good- thick and juicy medium rare is the way to go. The seafood pad thai was spicy and rich. The hamburger perfect.
The bread and maple butter is a must. The roast butternut squash salad was very good. The chocolate fondue was great- can be very romantic (not so much with a family party of 10 though!)",3
"In this busy world it is nice when friends can get together and enjoy a night of good food and good service.
Everyone at our table of ten enjoyed their meal which is rare and the waiter was prompt and took care of the small details, which we all appreciated. We all enjoyed ourselves and went away smiling  looking forward to doing it again. Thank you !",4
"We come there every month to meet friends and enjoy a really good meal.  What more can I write, we wouldn't keep returning if this wasn't a perfect experience. How do you know our names? Dikinspamtotsylv1.",4
I was at Miller Tavern for a second time this week.  It never fails me.  Great business lunch.  In the summer it's especially delightful sitting outside.  I like the service.  Never obtrusive.,4
This is my go to place for business lunches in North Toronto.  Great food and ambience - and I never feel rushed.  Keep.up the great work!,4
"On the hottest Sunday of their we sat beneath a lovely treed area (not the canopy because that just make you hot) and had an al a carte brunch.  Service was good ( except they forgot to bring the bread basket until we had finished eating).  We had lobster tacos, cobb salad, shakshuka and mushroom ravioli - all enjoyed and not a morsel left.  Prices have gone up but the quality is good.  Definitely recommend ... we keep returning.",3
"Once again we had an excellent experience at The Miller. We live only a few minutes away from the restaurant, having recently moved into the area. We find ourselves taking a meal there at least twice a month as we both love steak and my wife also loves lobster. The service is excellent and attentive without being intrusive. The food is well prepared and presented. Definitely one of our favourites.",4
Overpriced for the mundane quality of the food & poor wine selection . Very unmemorable.,1
"So grateful this historical tavern has been renovated to what it is,today, a real gem  and so,perfect to,celebrate any occasions or for,casual or more elegant dining!",4
"I've always enjoyed the brunch and hope to go again soon.  I enjoyed the lobster cobb salad on the brunch/lunch menu.  The strawberry cr√™pes dessert was excellent, refreshing with its hint of lemon, and not too sweet.  Our guest and I were glad we chose to have dessert.  If you go to dinner, another delicious dessert option is the Miller's chocolate fondue.

The ambience is great (five star) if you are going to brunch in the summertime and eat on the patio or on the verandah.  Last Sunday, we found it too hot to sit outside and had to dine in the pub because the verandah was closed.",3
The food was very overpriced and was just okay. The service was very poor. Inattentive waiter. He also hoovered over the debit machine watching as we entered our pin to pay as well as when we entered the tip. That's not acceptable.  I would not go back and I would not recommend this restaurant. You can get way better value for your money at much nicer restaurants in the area.,2
We went as a group of 8 to the Miller for lunch on Saturday.  There were very few people inside so it was quiet and we were able to converse easily as compared to the last visit where we couldn't hear each other.  We all felt that the food was good but not worth the price.  We found it to be quite expensive for lunch.  Only 2 people had beer or wine yet the total bill was over $400.  I would only go back for a very special occasion - such as when someone else is paying!!,2
Very nice service and food was excellent. Got to sit on the patio which made it even better.,4
The food was over cooked. The waiter had too many tables to look after so service was fair. Great atmosphere on outside patio!,2
"Good location and parking nice outdoor patio,good spot to meet for a drink but food is nothing special and over priced for quality which is matched by the poor service  I blame the Managment for lack of training for the summer student staff .",2
"Our server went over and above to make our dining experience a pleasure.  And as always, the food is wonderful.",3
"Brunch over-priced, weak service, poor value - will not be back",1
"We were there on a beautiful afternoon.  Lots of sun and outdoor seating, with smaller, intimate spaces instead of one huge deck that gets out of control.  Drinks were good (and on special before 6pm) and we ordered a number of small plates off the bar menu, all of which were great.  Dinner, however, was a bit disappointing, as was the service.  Our waiter was unfriendly and did not listen, seemingly rather insincere.  I wouldn't hesitate to stop by again after work for drinks and snacks (particularly when you can enjoy the outdoor spaces) but wouldn't make it a dinner destination.  The entrees were underwhelming.",2
Took a while to be seated for our reservation but all in all a good experience,3
I have always relied on the Miller for lunches or dinner with friends coming in from the 'burbs as it is close to the highway and there's lots of parking. But I got sticker shock the last time I went....they used to have a great seafood menu but now it is much more steak and beef and prices are mostly above $40 for those entrees....even the seafood entrees (only 3 now) are high $30s or over $40......they need some simple grilled fish choices under $30 or we have to go elsewhere.,3
"We try to meet once a month and we love coming to the Miller, for many reasons. Obviously the staff, food, beauty, but some of us used to skate there so it brings back memories. We also love the location as we come from distances. Thank you again.",4
"I have been to the Miller Tavern many times before -- it is conveniently located for those coming  by subway as well as those driving from other parts of town. My most recent visit was on an incredibly busy night, resulting in quite slow service, even to order drinks at the beginning. There was also a screaming child; even though the child was on the other level, the noise disturbed us at our table. I think management recognized these issues, to their credit, and brought us an excellent dessert ""on the house"". Normally (all my previous times!) I could park for free in their own parking lot, but this time, not only was that full, but even the paying lot next door was full -- and I had to wait for somebody to leave that paying lot. This adds a note of caution for me -- one cannot simply assume that the attractive feature of easy free parking will always be available. The food remains excellent and with a very wide menu, which wlll suit any taste or size of appetite or dietary restriction.",2
"Had the lobster cobb salad and it was really good.  My guest had a caesar salad with grilled salmon and her comment was ""I have had better caesar salad""!",2
Appies were excellent - prime rib was not very good.  Steak was tough.  Sides were good.  Not worth the price for sure but the patio was lovely and the cocktails were nice and moderately priced.,3
"""Weather Permitting"" at the Miller outdoor patio is always a special time.  Great Buzz, excellent Menu / Wine List and cheery Service make it very enjoyable!  The Miller is a neighbourhood gem for those who skated on the Don River floodplain out of the basement at the ""Jolly Miller"" 50+ years ago.",4
Throughly enjoyed the ambience and food of this stylish Tavern. The brunch menu was full of very filling choices and I like the prix fixe concept.,3
"Food is medium, service is medium, ambiance is great, parking is easy...way too expensive for what they're offering",2
"First of all - Happy Hour at the Miller is worth it - they have mini plates for $5.25 as well as drinks - it is a great way to try a variety of appetizers.
The wait staff is excellent and they are attentive.",4
They come off with a pretentious feel and I'm not too convinced it's deserving. This place is very expensive and the food could be a lot better for the price.,2
"What is the line above? I am not allowed to write how much we love dining with you, hence we return monthly.",4
"the food at the Miller is very good. Lunch specials are great Turkey crepes and Asian shortribs are amazing. fine food in a neighbourhood setting, albeit the neighbourhood being tony Hoggs Hollow  
I don't think you can go wrong with this place not cheap but very good",4
"I have been a regular at Millar Tavern for many years because I enjoy the ambiance.  However, Millar Tavern has recently boosted the prices out of sight.  They raised the price of their already pricey burger by 38%--from $18 to $25.  (Other menu items are substantially more expensive!)  One would expect the best burger known to mankind for $25.  We ordered two burgers and we were NOT asked how we would like it cooked.  Nonetheless, we specified ""medium.""  Instead  of a pink juicy burger, we we were served overcooked brown dried up cardboard burger patties.  Can you imagine overcooking a $25 burger?  We were well into our meal when the server offered to take it back.  We elected to choke it down.  Needless to say, this is the end of a long  relationship with Millar Tavern.",1
This 'this and that' platter is awesome -- definately enough for a meal for one and a lovely choice of appetizers that were all delicious.  The service and food were excellent.  Staff were attentive but not hovering.  A lovely dinner out with the girls.  Our table was ready when we arrived.  Thank you -- we had a great dinner.,4
"Went for Mother's Day, busy but handled ok, food and service good.  Recommended.",3
"We enjoyed lunch on the patio - fresh salads & good burgers. 
Wide selection of drinks & some good wines by the glass

It's a good place in the area - not gourmet - but extremely satisfying and dependable.",3
"We had a great table in the convertible open-air dining porch overlooking the Don River!  The Patio was also open for enjoyable alfresco dining.  The food and service at this Historic site is always strong and seafood  ""thematic"" - a wonderful location for a special family event!",3
Waitress seemed to forget we were there at every stage of the order/eat/pay cycle.,2
"enjoyable staff, waiter was overly concerned and reesponded to one of the meals being delayed in arriving at the table. Consumer services, unlike many canadian faciliities was GREAT!",4
"I was very disappointed to hear that you no longer seat upstairs for brunch. Just after 5pm. I thought the view from the enclosed balcony was a great selling point. 

Instead I was placed near the bar. Not even near the  window. The food is great but so are a lot  of other places. There's no ambiance any more.",1
"We keep returning because our experience has always been perfect. Some of us used to skate there, 60 years ago and it is fun to return. For years it was a mysterious tavern where we could not think of entering it's doors, we could only go into the dressing room for skaters. We love the staff, food, availability of parking and convenience bringing out of town folks together. We will be back the end of May. Thank you",4
"We went there for my wife's birthday with two of our children.  The food, the service and the atmosphere were delightful and it was a most enjoyable experience for all of us.",3
"I was at Miller once before about four years ago.  My wife & I have been busy packing for our move and had not made plans for our anniversary.  So,  I wondered if Miller Tavern might be a quick but unusual outing.  We were not disappointed one bit.",4
The Miller is a bright spot in an uptown setting. Great for lunch or dinner and the food is very good. The turkey crepe for lunch special was wonderful.,3
"Steaks dishes,were excellent. Wild salmon was cooked perfectly. However, the halibut was dried and did not worth for the,price.",3
"Good food and good service in what is now a first class restaurant in spot that was a ""pub"" .
Parking is there but arrive early for free parking or you will be forced to City lot where you have to pay.
Overall, a  good spot just south of 401 on Yonge",3
"Two of the orders were fine.  Two salmon burger orders were not fine.  The salmon was completely devoid of taste and very disappointing.   We would probably not return for a while.  

R. Matsui",2
"I like Miller Tavern for their patio. And summettime fare. Unfortunately I was a little disappointed with their Brunch. The service was really quite unsatisfactory although our server was very pleasant, she was, for the mist part, unavailAble to us.",2
"The service, food and spacious booths were excellent and look forward to our next brunch!!",3
We have lunch each month with you and return because it is so perfect. Some of us have been friends for 68 years and love the ambiance and food you provide. Thank you for being there for us and for most hospitable staff.,4
"Last minute choice to dine at Miller Tavern. Great evening out and I would go again. Food was very good as was the ambience and mood on the outdoor patio. Overall a pleasant and relaxing experience. Was somewhat ""pricey"". Only disappointment was the lack of parking space in Miller's lot. Had to park in the adjacent pay-to-use municipal lot.",3
"i have been dining here since 2002. I have seen employees come and go but miller tavern remains consistent on food, service, ambiance. Job well done. Looking forward to my next visit",4
"We had a lovely lunch here to celebrate my uncle's 92nd birthday. The staff were fabulous, and brought him a piece of yummy cheesecake with a candle and decadent little shooters for all of us as a birthday surprise.   A great place, very good food, albeit a touch pricey for lunch, but for a special lunch, well worth the trip. The name of this place, by indicating that it is a tavern, gives a very different impression from what it looks like inside.  Very classy, very nice place.",3
"I have been at the Miller several times but before this latest visit, the seating was always upstairs.  Next time I come I will definitely state that we want to sit in the upstairs portion of the restaurant. Didn't care much for the ambiance of the lower ""sports bar"" atmosphere.",2
"I had Beef Bourguignon and my wife had Rosted Chicken.  Both had good taste, were prepared in reasonable time and good sized portions.  Overall a good meal.",2
Didn't receive points for using open table?,4
"Went for a nice dinner for two. 

Service staff was overall friendly, but our server was a touch awkward table side.( may have been new staff) 

Service was paced well, never felt rushed at all. 
Food was flavourful and quite filling. Had crab cakes to start. Cakes were seasoned well and elegantly presented. However they were served on wilted old lettuce. This took away from the dish's presentation, but had no Bering on taste which was excellent. 

This was followed by a classic prime rib dinner. Everything was delicious and well prepared except for the Yorkshire pudding was rock hard. This part of the dish needs to be re-worked

Dessert was the cherry on top of the meal. Had the cheese cake waffle and ice cream. 

Overall a great meal and experience, but a touch over priced for what you get, And a few issues with service need to be corrected.",2
"Excellent, attentive service.  Good wine selection.  Halibut is delicious.  Prime rib was very good, but a little too rare.  Overall, lovely evening.",3
"Over-priced VERY BLAND sea food. Very noisy. Valentine's Day dinner, with televisions everywhere playing random sports and loud brash clientele. Dropped $200 and felt like I could have had a better night at the dive bar down the street. Only reason to go is the history, otherwise, stay away.",1
"I had never been to Miller Tavern but have driven by it for years. When I finally decided to take my wife there for a Valentine's dinner we were seated near the bar, which was loud and crowded with people watching the leaf's game. Overall it was ""nice"" but I doubt I'll be back.",2
Have been here many times.  The outdoor space is lovely (mind you not in February).   The prime rib dinner for two is great value and tastes wonderful.  Staff  are very service focussed.  All in all a good experience.,4
Great place to grab a perfect steak before going to the theater.  Enjoyable atmosphere and good server.,3
"Miller Tavern is a good place for lunch.  The menu is good, and the beer is good.  Where we were seated was a little noisy, but, not outrageous.  If anyone knew this in the days of the Jolly Miller, be prepared for a shock.  The place has been cleaned up and looks wonderful; an elegant urban tavern.  However, the new d√©cor comes at a price, and the price is printed and given to you as a menu.  These are some of the highest prices for lunch that I have seen in any Tavern anywhere.  Perhaps they should drop the word Tavern, and put an accent over the 'e'  in Miller.   That might make you think it is worth the prices they charge.  Fine for a business lunch, but, I would never come here for anything else; it just is not that good for what they charge.",3
"Very nice waiter, good service, good wine list.  The turkey crepe was so good I want the recipe, and the boeuf bourguignon also very good according to my friend.  We sat inside but the upstairs verandah looked like a great place to be for lunch.  (Yes it's enclosed in January!)",4
"I have been for dinner and recalled enjoying it.  But Brunch was very disappointing.  It was like decent hotel food but not much else. Brunch included mimosa, pastries and dessert.  Brunch meal itself was good, but did not make up for the rest of the price fix meal that they seemed to just throw together ""stuff"" that was simply not good.  Mimosa was all orange juice, Pastry's were dry and lacked flavor (chain hotel continental or grocery store quality). The fruit salad they served with each meal did not pair well at all.  Plus all the fruit lacked flavor.  It was like your old Aunts fruit salad that had been sitting in a too cold fridge for a couple days. The dessert was decent but the lemon tart was so covered in icing sugar it ruined something hiding underneath that might have been good.",1
"The overall experience and food was good, the problem was that we were seated on the covered sun deck and when on the occasion someone opened a door to smoke it was freeeeezing.",2
"Our server was exceptional. At the outset he offered us a taste of the house wine and brought both a Chilean and Californian to taste. After our meal we were brought a complementary dessert (yummy chocolate fondue). We were a group of three meeting for the  first time in two years. We had been seated downstairs amongst a couple of large parties. The noise level was a bit high but we could still chat and we saw no reason for complaint. However, our observant server, we believe, offered the dessert to compensate for us not being seated upstairs.",4
"Wish I remembered her name, she had an Irish accent(I think) and was very friendly and service was wonderful. Both my wife and I thought she was great.",3
"This is a great spot for family and friends. You can choose an energetic or quiet environment under the same roof, depending on the occasion. Food and service are always first class.",4
"Nothing reasonably priced.  Who would think the cobb salad would have deli meat instead of some diced chicken.  And when I requested no bacon, no offer of any substitute.  For a salad costing over $20, way below expectation.  My fault on the calamari- didn't realize it would be deep fried. I should have asked.    The lights over the table are at such an awkward height that it really impeded on conversation.  There are much better choices in our neighbourhood.",2
"I have been to the Miller Tavern many times for dinner and business lunches.  This visit was disappointing.  The lunch menu was quite limited.  There was no fresh fish on it.  The entree salads were quite expensive and the food presentation was lacking zing.  To top it off the service this time was extremely slow.  Albeit the resteraunt was busy as it is Xmas time, I epected better and will re think coming again this time of the year",2
"Miller Tavern in North York is a great meeting place for lunch or afternoon cocktails.  Is very accessible to the highway and subway, but avoids the heavy traffic of Yonge St North or downtown.  The staff are friendly and the food is good.",3
"I made a Brunch reservation for my husband's birthday and we were not at all disappointed. We've dined here before on the patio with our family and thoroughly enjoyed it. The ambiance upstairs is lovely, especially with the Christmas decorations. Our server (unfortunately did not get her name, short blond young lady) was great, very professional and engaged with us throughout, but without being intrusive. The menu was delectable and my husband was presented with a delicious apple crumble tart in celebration of his birthday. He was truly wowed!
Thank you for a memorable afternoon, we will certainly recomment your Brunch and will be back.",4
"The food was very good but the prices for lunch, salads were outrageously high.",3
"Great food as expected.  I am an occasional diner for networking and special occasion events.  I do, however, take exception to this growing practice of charging a tiny basket of bread as a menu item.  As noted in a NYTimes article not long ago, this practice takes away from the experience, particularly when a dinner with wine can easily cost around $200 per couple.",3
"Dined here with family for my birthday dinner.  We're locals so the Miller is convenient and in the past we've had a good meal.  The service was very good.  My husband and kids enjoyed their meals.  My prime rib roast beef was not good.  I asked for medium doneness expecting some pink meat but the beef was served very red and was just about cold.  Seasonal vegies and yorkshire pud were underwhelming.  Baked potato was the best part of the meal.  We did not have appetisers or desert.  Won't be rushing back here to eat.  I've rated the food ""fair"" because the family ate all their meals, my meal I would rate ""poor"".  The food is overpriced for the quality.",1
"Food was served quickly. Server was great. Complimentary hors d'oeuvre. I sat in the heated all year round enclosed veranda. Had some delicious scallops and pasta. The only problem would be the price, and the amount you get for it. $25 for a burger? I think the cheapest thing for dinner was the mushroom ravioli at $19. But lots of great selections of beef.

The bar was nice, not too slow, not too loud, and a relaxing post-dinner atmosphere. Good bartenders.",3
"small concern, but coffee was lukewarm and overpriced. our server kindly subtracted the price from the bill when this was brought to her attention.",3
"We arrived early and it was busy but we were seated right away.  Our server was prompt and efficient.  We had a bottle of Porcupine Ridge Syrah, my husband ordered the Sinatra Style New York Strip ($39) and I got the Stilton Filet Mignon ($36).  With the steaks, you get your choice of only one side, which seems a little skimpy to me.  Hubby had a loaded baked potato and I ordered fries, which were not terribly good.  Should have ordered the mushrooms instead.  There was a slight problem with my order as they originally forgot the Stilton Butter but it was delivered quickly to our table.  The steaks were fabulous.  We had the Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e for dessert which was delicious.  All in all, a good experience, except for the fries.",2
"We were a group of eight. Our server, Amy, was attentive without being overbearing.
The kitchen provided an amuse-bouche and the bar a complimentary nightcap.
Everyone enjoyed their meal and we look forward to our next visit.",4
"You can not find too many places in GTA that have great parking and great food :)
Miller's is one of those places. Fantastic location. Hop to 401, food doesn't fail, and 
always outstanding service. Love to bring our family here. Hassle free eating.",3
"We had a mishap with the food itself, but the manager more than made up for the mistake.  He was extremely apologetic and rectified the situation immediately.  His efficiency and helpfulness made our experience a good one. So much so that we would consider coming back again.",3
"10th or 11th visit but first since the new menu. Prices have gone up considerably and choice down. Service was pleasant and attentive. Noise and bustle was moderate, perhaps not surprising given it was less than 1/3 full. Enjoy the location for convenience and atmosphere but they alone can't overcome the deficiencies of the new menu and pricing. $25 for a burger? Come on!",2
We thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience. The food was amazing and the ambiance perfect.  The service and the special touches to make this a wonderful anniversary were really appreciated.   A big thank you to Peter and Laura.,4
Good for groups and for intimate conversations.  Had an enjoyable dinner with a friend and an attentive waiter,3
"I was with a group of women who get together every two months for a restaurant dinner.  This was our first visit to The Miller and we all found it a very positive experience.  The food, ambiance and staff were all top notch.  We will, most likely return.",3
"We had been to Miller tavern for New Year's Eve and enjoyed it, so we thought we'd try again for Thanksgiving. For $27, we got an ""amuse"" (a single spring roll) and a turkey dinner. The turkey dinner was very good and just the right serving size, but for $27, I thought a dessert might be included.  Nope...not at all.  So, for two dinners, two desserts and a bottle of very nice Syrah (Jackson-Triggs Delaine), the bill came to almost $150.  I've spent that at Rosewater and felt I got more value for it there.  By the way, even with a $15 corkage fee (and only $1 on Mondays!), it would have been cheaper to bring the wine ourselves.  Also, it would have been nice to get a bread basket.",3
"This was the second time my family has had Thanksgiving dinner here and we thoroughly enjoyed the meal. Traditional, but each item on my plate was extremely flavourful and well-seasoned. And just the right amount too. Room for dessert and we didn't have to roll ourselves out the door.",4
"This is a great location with good parking.  On this occasion, the service was friendly but slow.  The salad was limp and uninspired with an underripe tomato slice on top.  The main course was a two person shared prime rib with veg.  The mashed potatoes arrived on a steaming hot plate but were themselves tepid and crusted over - sent these back.  The vegetables were too undercooked to be worth eating.  The prime rib was spectacular.  
They did not offer coffee after the meal but brought a delicious cinnamon liqueur shot - wonderful  Still wanted coffee though and had to have it after the liqueur.",2
"Lots of space for groups. Good menu and selection. Portions were on the smaller side, but overall very tasty.",3
Specifically asked for a quiet table when we booked our reservation as our son has hearing difficulties - they placed us right next to the entrance to a large private party that was quite loud. Food was disappointing. Had to send steak back - not cooked as we had asked. Service was good and waitress was very nice but overall disappointing.,1
"Compared to other $$$ restaurants around I'd say it is better than most.  I didn't go with huge expectations but it was fair value given the price you pay for a two or three star place these days.
Nothing remarkable for the variety of dishes; but simple respectful, attentive server which is nice for a change!",2
"We dined here for a celebratory lunch for my mothers birthday recently. Unfortunately, we had the most horrible service on this particular occasion. The waitress had to be reminded several times to bring water for the table, milk for my son and then completely forgot the coffee I ordered with my dessert. No apologies were offered for these misses.  However, in my opinion the worst part was her rude response when my husband asked what sides that came with a dish. Her response was, ""I don't know, I've never had it. I can another waiter if you really want to know"". He didn't trouble her with such an outlandish request! 

This was an aberration because in the past I've dined here and enjoyed outstanding service from the waitstaff.",1
"Delicious food, good service, but we sat around for quite a long time before our entr√©es came. Beef did not come exactly as expected (asked for medium, got medium rare). Disappointed that the seasonal dessert was sold out, but the desserts that we did get were very good.",3
"I took a friend for her birthday, and the day was nice enough to eat on the enclosed porch.  I have been to the Miller a few times before, with mixed reviews.  Brunch was very good, and reasonably priced.  A very good pastry basket accompanied the first course (a Bellini and Sangria).  I had eggs with truffles and my friend had a cobb salad.  The portions were good, and everything nicely presented.  Dessert, an apple cake, was excellent.  The only issue we had was the turkey in my friend's salad seemed to be shaved; but the turkey in the other salads we saw nearby was clearly carved from a turkey breast.",3
"the Miller Tavern is a kind of retreat into warm surroundings, calm and reassuring service, a broad spectrum of menu items, and good feeling. It has been said that at a fine restaurant, one should remember the quality of the occasion, not the waiter's name. So it is at Miller Tavern: memorable for the right reasons!",4
"I use the Miller Tavern a lot for large and small events, lunches and dinners.  The variety of food and the service are consistently good and I like the many choices of ambiance and seating.  I always have a positive experience at the Miller!",3
We have been to the Miller numerous times and we always enjoy it. Delicious seafood dishes in particular!,3
"The Miller is on a landmark North York site. It is a fine dining establishment and delivers good food in a pleasing surrounding. More casual then a similar downtown place would be, it is a solid choice for any meal.",4
"I always thought the Miller tavern was more like a bar scene but my friends brought their kids and it was family friendly. We got a private room, which was great for the kids, and the service was amazing. The food was great too. I  had oysters and seafood platter and it was delicious.",4
It's pricey for what you get; $16 for burgers and $6 for sweet potato fries. But I still think it ranks as one on the best burgers in the city.,1
"menu was excellent---lots to choose from---every  course from soup to salad to main course and dessert was well presented, tasty and high quality. The ambience on the partially enclosed porch was most relaxing.",4
"Awesome environment, great service and wonderful food. The prices are good and the service is friendly and outgoing.",4
"Great service, food and ambience. I have been there several times for diner and always enjoyed it.",3
Enjoyed dining on the patio.  My salmon burger was excellent as was the friendly and efficient server.  Especially enjoyed the complementary chocolate wine served with coffee.,4
"I took my wife and children for her birthday and had excellent meal and service.  The Miller provided a complimentary chocolate fondue and liqueurs for desert, which was a nice touch.",4
"Pretty patio dining. Our waiter was very accommodating.  Overall, a lovely evening.  Only problem, there is no escape from smoking.  We moved tables only to have more smokers around.  As there three tiers for the patio area, perhaps one can be dedicated to non-smokers.",2
"We had 2 visitors from Calgary and one of them had never been to Ontario before so we wanted something special. It was PERFECT! We live 3 hours away and well worth the drive. The food was spectacular, seasoned beautifully with wonderful presentation. Very pleasing to the eye and a delight to eat . I was also impressed with the variety of items on the menu...there was something for everyone. Our party of 6 were all pleased with our apps and entrees. To our surprise the restaurant presented our table with an assorted seafood platter that had an array of tender morsels to tempt our taste buds........ this took our dining experience over the top and made it even more of a special experience.  Great!",4
"'Found the service and attention excellent.  There were 5 of us and we all had our steaks either over-done (quite well-done) or too raw.  One was sent back because it was 'blue' (we received a replacement n/c).  We thought it surprising in a place that specializes in steak, however, we had a good time that evening anyway.",3
"Awesome dinner with friends -all of us had different fish plates, all excellent. Patio and service terrific!",4
Everyone was so blown away by The Miller. The server was very friendly and patient (especially with my out-of-town relatives who don't speak english!) and he made the whole experience such a pleasure! The food was delicious with generous portions! Thanks again and looking forward to our next visit!,4
But the fries both sweet potato and russett were both frozen. I was expecting fredh,2
"the Sirloin ordered as medium rare came thin and medium well.  Staff did not hesitate to offer to replace it.  The replacement came thin and rare, not medium rare, although this time it was at least moist and tender.  I ate it, but not what I preferred and not what I ordered.
Relaxed atmosphere.  Good for our business conversation.  Wine list great but over-priced.",2
Awesome brunch menu with a good selection. Very nice upper level window seating.,3
"A ""high end"" atmosphere (wonderful, tasty food) in a comfortably elegant and friendly setting.",3
"Chose it as a romantic dinner, and was received well. The food was great, and the outdoor patio was just perfect.",4
"I like the Miller, it's reliable and good food with a great atmosphere. Had their Margarita - amazing. We just had a light lunch the beet and goat cheese salad with chicken ‚Ä¶ only they forgot the goat cheese. Ah well. I've eaten here many times and will always go back!",3
"Overrated overpriced with inattentive hostesses and indifferent service. Food is decently prepared but bland. Although I reserved the table 10 days advance they made no effort to offer or time a patio spot even though requested in advance as well. Small gesture at end, chocolate liqueur to go with our coffee on the house, but by that time it was too little too late. If you are in the area it is a nice setting with some historical significance to Toronto - but in a word - meh.",1
"We went for dinner and the food of good quality, a little over priced and do not expect large portions.  Desserts were exceptional.  I am glad we were not in a rush, as the service was extremely slow.  The waiter, Tye, claimed there were understaffed but other tables did not wait 30 minutes between coming by.  If you go to sit on the patio, stay away from Yonge Street, as you can't carry on a conversation with the traffic.",2
I asked for a quiet table but was seated in a very noisy section.  Our service and food were very good,3
"Came with 3 others to celebrate a birthday & it did not disappoint! Oysters are wonderful, enjoyed the food and good wines by the glass.
Staff are very good and attentive.",3
"We go for the patio, mostly, which is really nice.  Nice selection of fresh oysters for the appetizer, and they had a decent selection of wines in the $40-$50 range.  Have never had a great meal there, though, especially for the price.  This time I had the white tuna entree, which was nicely presented but a bit overlooked for my taste (I like very raw inside).  Wasabi mashed potatoes were dry and lumpy, though, not really appetizing at all.  Stuffed sole served on chickpeas was OK, but bland and again not great (my wife left half on her plate).

We will return, no doubt, but only for the ambiance, and ever hopeful to be pleasantly surprise by improved food!",2
"On a hot summer night, the patio at the Miller Tavern is a perfect spot for casual outdoor dining.  The setting sun was blocked by the history and on a 30 degree evening, there was no humidity.  The mushroom soup was superb.  My wife had the swordfish and I had the scallops and orzo pasta.  They were sufficiently accommodating to give me chocolate gelato instead of vanilla with my apple crumble.  all in all, an enjoyable evening.",3
"Wonderful setting at ""The Miller""; historic mill and road house in Hogg's Hollow! Great, central meet-up spot for gathering with neighbourhood friends, family or business partners. Food and service complement the great tiered patio arrangement and positive service.",3
"excellent menu with good food, great wine list, good ambience , had a great server, warm evening with the windows open--all in all, a very enjoyable evening",3
"Hi!
Unfortunately , this is not first time when I don't like your food :(
My quinoa salad wasn't fresh, the fish cold and glass of chianti was sourand stale. Sorry.
Thank you for staff.",2
"Was amazing, fantastic service was great we are planning to come back with family and for our anniversary would highly recommend to our friends to go there",4
"I've always loved the location. Starting to look tired inside. My biggest disappointment was the food. The prime rib was flavourless, seemed day old. The Yorkshire pudding was below what I could make from a grocery store freezer.  My daughter had swordfish and she didn't like the cold quinoa salad combination. 

Pricey and seems like pub quality food at best.",2
lovely meal in a great setting and completely unrushed,3
My friends and I have met at Miller Tavern a few times for lunch and have enjoyed the surroundings and the food.  We come from all directions and your locations is central for all of us.  The menu offers many choices and we all have had dishes to suit our particular tastes.  We will be glad to come again and to recommend the Miller Tavern to other friends.,3
Had dinner at Millers on their awesome patio. The weather was a dream and food was fantastic. Love the parking and location. We come often.,3
"Popovers to go with prime rib tonight were not at all too buttery! Server was most excellent - allowed us to taste wine before choosing our glasses. We were also delighted with the ice cream/popcorn/caramel sauce presentation - dinner and a show! Also happy to note the prime rib dinner is not only on Sunday nights, so we will be back again, perhaps with even more friends in tow. The patio is lovely for Toronto summer.",4
I have been to the Miller often and have always had a great meal...this was the first time for my luncheon companion and she as also impressed...she intends to return with her husband in the near future....!,4
This was our 2nd visit to The Miller for our group of 4.  The first time was very good and the 2nd time also very good.  Our waitress Carla was attentive and helpful.  We will be back......,3
I love the Miller Tavern but this visit was a disappointment. I froze almost my entire dinner. I had to ask twice for the fireplace to be turned on or the AC to be turned down. Finally after a few other tables complained they did shut off the fan.The service was friendly but kitchen was slow. My chicken was dry. But my Creme Brule was perfect.,2
"We were four women.  I called ahead to request a table on the glass enclosed deck and mentioned my friends birthday.  Everything was great.  Perfect spot, food, service turned out to be a perfect choice.",3
We always enjoy the food at The Miller.  It is a great neighbourhood spot.  The menu is varied and suits most tastes.  Great wine.,2
"Great food, a bit pricey, and great service. Lots of well -to-do folks with their kids. The music is the only false note.  Quite bad. Put some quiet jazz on!",2
The fritatta was small and overdone and i had to order an additional dish.  This was not a brunch by anymeans - more of a  breakfast,2
"For about the 8th year, I celebrated my birthday by hosting a family dinner at The Miller - and what a great experience it was! The two vegetarians, the seafood aficionados, and the steak and prime rib lovers in the group all agreed this was a delightfully happy and successful dining  occasion. Our server was attentive - but not too attentive; the food was prepared in good time - with no sense of rush; and the ambience was energetic and upbeat - without being loud and noisy. The varied menu offerings were appealing with something to cater to every taste. And the red water glasses added ""a touch of class"" to the table decor. One person, commenting on dinner, was heard to say, ""Perfection"". Perhaps that word best summed up our entire evening!",4
They have to learn from other restaurants in the city of Toronto how to prepare lamb chops..the sauce was terrible..grilled lamb chops doesn't have to have a sauce !,2
We reserved well ahead of time but was placed at a table right outside the restroom. Food took a long time and was lukewarm. Steak was tough. Stuffed sole was greasy. Quality definitely not worth the money. Way way below par. Very disappointing.,0
"Delicious seafood! Food never fails to disappoint. On the pricey side, but nice for special occasions.",3
"Great food and excellent service as always. Even though they were very busy, we were not rushed which I've found happens in most other restaurants on special occasions.",3
Had a great waiter who knew the menu and had good suggestions on wine and food.,3
"Took my wife and mother for Mother's Day - along with my 5 month old. They had a Mother's Day special. It was ok, but I think their regulator menu is better.",2
"Went for Mother's Day lunch. They served us drinks. Five minutes later the food came. No time to celebrate, they rushed us and I had to ask them to go away and leave us alone. There was no feeling of festivity for the special day. They could have offered mothers a  rose as a gesture. We were disappointed. This is the second time I have tried this place and won't come back. The food was fine, but portions small and the food was not interesting or special. The place was pricey for what you received.",2
"I had higher hopes for this restaurant in general. Given that it was Mother's Day, I'll give them a pass, and will try the place again. Several service mistakes, forgot an appetizer, a drink, then the manager brought the coffee that was for another table. The food was mediocre.",2
We took our parents there for Mothers Day.  The food was absolutely amazing.  The service was amazing.  Our server Howie was the best Waiter I have ever had.  We had a slight issue with one of the orders and the way that the owner and Howie took care of the situation was perfect.  This is now one of my favorite restaurants.  Will 100% be back.,4
Sat in veranda for birthday lunch and very enjoyable. Has the flat fee menu of 3 courses and excellent choice. Thanks for complimentary birthday cake and for remembering to bring out.,3
Popovers for prime rib way too buttery at bottom but the plate overall is yummy!,3
"We were a bit disappointed.  There was a very limited brunch menu to choose from, and you would never have known it was Easter.  Not a flower or Spring branch to be seen, and nothing festive at all about the menu.",1
"Great food, not really appropriate for Easter brunch. More of a sports bar ambiance, probably because they served us brunch in the lower sports bar level. I have had dinner at the restaurant upper level and found it less of a sprts bar feel.",2
"Great place for our family gathering, we liked the central location. Menu had several brunch selections that appealed, service was very good.",3
"It was a thoughrouly enjoyable experience for all.  The waiter was a bit overbearing and rushed but other than that, great.",4
We both had dietary restrictions and Miller accommodated our needs well.,3
"The bar was super quick in preparing our drink orders, but the kitchen was super slow in preparing our meal. Also, my steak was overcooked.",1
"Overall OK experience. Our server was very unwelcoming, didn't seem like she was very interested in serving us. Food overall was good.",2
"I had the Roasted Black Cod, and I realize it's a premium product, but for $33, I'd expect a dish that is somewhat more substantial than an appetizer portion. The ""tiny"" piece of cod was great, but the rest of the dish was somewhat bland. Fortunately, my date wasn't that hungry and shared her pad thai.",2
"This is the favourite meeting spot for my girlfriends and I who get together
about four times a year. The food is always good, the service attentive
but not invasive, and the setting relaxed and conducive to a good long chat.",3
"We can always rely on great food, ambiance and service.
Great variety in types of food on menu and flexible chef re- small changes to the meal we order.
One of my favorite restaurants.",4
"Great service, food tasty, attractive decor!
We will be back!!!",3
Food was excellent. Setting was semi-private. Service was solid. Great evening for a night out with friends.,4
"We have been regulars at the Miller since it's makeover. It is usually our first choice and it has become that for friends and relatives when we are in that ""where to go"" mode. The diverse menu has something for everyone and they are very accommodating if any changes are required.",3
"Food overall is good..however we ordered half dozen of oyster but it's came like one of them not that fresh , therefore we requested the waitress to change.but surprising me that the waitress just explained oyster is fine as long as you it's not smelly... We still insisted to change, she just use her hand and took out the oyster...( oh my god!) what's scary!",2
I have eaten here for both lunch and dinner. The food is always good as is the service. They have an extensive menu with varied choices and a good wine list. The ambiance is quite pleasant with a number of booths as well as an enclosed sunroom. There is also a bar area. The parking lot is usually full so arrive early and make a reservation if you are arriving at a peak time.,4
"We sat on the balcony. I love the sunshine and view. This time the Shepherds Pie and the Chicken Pot Pie from the lunch menu did not hit the spot. I've always enjoyed the food in the past, so I will be returning.",3
Together with the menu offered and having its own parking the Miller uptown is a comfortable neighbourhood spot for brunch and dinner while providing a good location for lunch for business in that area. Two seating levels offered that can match the occaision.,2
An enjoyable evening with a great server and good food !,3
"Good menu selection (Winter Festival), reasonable portions, good quality food, house wines (white and red) were very good, service was well paced, helpful and friendly, price was very reasonable. Overall a pleasant evening and a good meal.",3
went with three others. location is good for client meeting as booths are available. Food was expensive for size of plate and location. no bread at the table. food only warm.,1
"The food was pretty good. We had a $25 gift card. With the gift card, the prices were fine. I don't know if I would visit again for regular price. The parking lot is very small! It fills up quickly, and then you have to go to the neighbouring Green P and PAY for parking. A bit of a nuisance, but its only $4. The place is quite nice... very masculine. We sat in the heated glass-enclosed veranda, which had a decent view of the park (and parking lot!) behind the restaurant. Overall, we had a good time, but you could probably get the same experience for a cheaper price.",3
"A varied menu, good selection of wines and wonderful atmosphere make Miller Tavern a good choice for diners. You can spend a little, with shared appetizers, or more ... but you won't be disappointed.
My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that during slow times, like late lunch, waitstaff seem to disappear and trying to flag someone to bring the cheque can be annoying. Care should be taken that diners don't feel as if they've been forgotten. This can be a problem at many restaurants, not just this one.
Miller Tavern, while a large establishment, feels intimate. A reliable eatery.",3
First time having brunch here. Selection is okay. Food quality was okay. Really different food quality than dinner service,4
"took my girlfriend here for our anniversary. everything was great except when dessert came, the place was not designed to say happy anniversary. I called the same day in the afternoon to ask for this extra service, which I have no problem paying extra for. the gentleman ensured me what I was asking for wasn't a problem. restaurant staff need to take more responsibility for customers special occasions. how can I recommend this restaurant to my friends when something simple as that is forgotten?",3
My husband and I have been to the Miller many times and have never had a bad meal. I would recommend it to anyone.,4
"We LOVE the Miller Tavern for the food--but the last experience was not as great. The food was spectacular (as usual) but the service on the other hand was not the greatest. Perhaps it was because it was busy, but the waiter and the help staff were not service oriented.",3
"A bit of an older crowd. Everything else is perfect, but it's one of those places that seems more suitable for an older audience. Mind you, the food and service was amazing, but the style of the restaurant is set for an older crowd.",3
"The Miller is a very special place. It has historical significance, lovely surroundings, wonderful staff, and great food. Our evenings at the Miller are very special. When we have friends in from out of town, we are very proud to introduce them to this beautiful restaurant.",4
I took my fiance there for Valentines day. I have driven by this place all the time and finally decided to give it a try. Parking was in the back and ample spaces. We had a 7:30 reservation and got there early and we were seated right away. The menu looked amazing. I had the Ahi Tuna Starter and my fiance had the Caesar Salad. We both loved our starters. For the main course I had the Sirloin Steak and my finance had the White Fish. They were both prepared exactly how we ordered it. The food was amazing and tasty. We were not rushed at all. Our Waitress was very good. The dessert menu looked amazing. BUT we just had the Sorbet. Don't get me wrong it was perfect. Will make this place a regular stop on our list.,4
"Was here last year on valentine's day with my husband celebrating our wedding (feb. 13, 2013), and had a pleasant experience sitting upstairs. We were given complementary amuse bouche and a chocolate shot before dessert. We said we'd come back here this year on valentine's day again to celebrate our 1st year wedding anniversary and we did. Last year, we were seated upstairs, and it was great service. This year, after booking reservation a month ahead, and noting them that we were there to celebrate our 1st year wedding anniversary which was very significant to us, and to please seat us somewhere nice like last year, we ended up being seated right beside the bar, near the washroom. Food was good, but service was very slow due to crowd.",1
A special 5 course Valentines Day menu was offered. Overall was good except I made the mistake of ordering the seafood dish which was mashed potatoes with unidentifiable seafood buried underneath. My husband's filet mignon was great so we shared that. Service was great even though they were very busy.,3
My husband and I had such a wonderful dinner on Valentines Day. Despite being busy the service and food were amazing. We didn't feel rushed and thoroughly enjoyed our evening out! We go to the Miller regularly and this night was no exception to the quality we usually receive!,4
"The food and service were very good and attentive. Noise level was low enough to accommodate conversation over dinner.
Very pleasant evening.",3
"Booked a business lunch and was pleasantly surprised at the extend of the menu. Food was very good, and service was exceptional. I will definitely be back here and recommend this spot for lunch or dinner",4
Just an easy place to go. Good parking. Very nice restaurant. Great good. Terrific service. Good for client lunch's. Great for dinner w spouse and friends,4
"Good service, good food, and good prices for the value. Nice view of Hoggs Hollow. A great place for an evening out!",3
"I had a ""guys steak night"" at Miller's Tavern recently. We had a great time, but I was truly stunned at how uniformly mediocre the food was. The Ceasar Salad was the worst I've had at a restaurant in years. It's hard to mess up a steak, but mine was completely uninspiring. We had the ""Sampler"" appetizer plate to share, and it was also bad: the spring rolls were greasy and tasteless, and about half the plate was plain pita bread! The Miller's tavern is really a glorified pub from the food perspective. Finally, in spite of claiming to be a high-end pub, there wasn't a single dark ale on tap available! So go there with good company, and you'll have a great time, as I did -- but don't go for the food or beer!",3
Very happy with our recent meal at Miller Tavern.,3
"You will not be disappointed at Miller Tavern. From food to ambiance, it is a great place for a family dinner (not with little kids), romantic dinner, business dinner or just to hang out downstairs at the Lounge for a drink.",4
"The Miller Tavern is our local ""go to"" spot for special occasions. This time was my 61st birthday, which for me was a very special occasion. Dinner was excellent, as usual. My wife had a lovely beef tenderloin with all the trimmings. I had the seafood pad thai which was delicious with a caesar salad. Kudos go to our waiter, Tyrell. He was very friendly and attentive. He comped dessert and coffee, as it was my birthday. That was service! We will definitely be back soon. Thanks Ty.",3
The Miller never disappoints. The menu is varied and the service is excellent. There is often a little added touch like an amuse bouche or a plate of biscotti or coffee shooter. I have used the Miller for private parties for family and friends and they have always been terrific.,3
"Seriously it wasn't packed by any means. We ordered from the winter menu which has the ""specials of the day"". The tomato based vegetable soup was stone cold, the beef bourgignon had hot and cold spots- very interesting how you did that - I am curious to know. It came in a delightful sauce with overcooked noodles and beef that fought me at every bite. My partner had a good grilled calamari however it was followed by a mixed seafood dish had the charm and taste of a TV dinner. It must have been the mashed potato flowerettes.... that threw it off.

Where was the waiter you now ask? um,,,, so did I at the time.

Been a long time since I ate what I used to call a cafeteria meal in my dorm at university - thanks for the memories!",0
"Indifferent service, high prices and the food is nothing special. Too bad as it's in a great spot.",1
We have always had great experiences at Miller Tavern.,4
"The owner is a great marketer , the place is consistently good . Portions could be a bit larger and it's too bad they charge for bread now , but we do want them to stay in business .",4
Miller Tavern has always been my favourite go-to place for special occasions.  Their brunch menu is fantastic and provides many different options.  The staff are always very friendly and very accommodating.  This place never disappoints!,4
We stopped in here after the theatre and enjoyed the food and the waiter we had very much. It was not noisey which is a plus! We have been here in the summer and enjoyed the outdoor patio very much,3
only the unreasonably loud music keeps MT from being a destination.,3
"My dish included a hard-boiled egg. The egg I was served was severely over-cooked: deep grey ring around a yoke so dry it was practically dust. I pointed it out to the server, who replied, ""Yes, I asked the kitchen and all the eggs are like that today"". The others at my table ordered the same dish and received eggs in the same condition. We all took them off our plates and asked the server to bin them. So, to be clear, the restaurant badly over-cooked it's hard-boiled eggs, fully recognized it's error, and decided to serve the inedible product anyway rather than re-steam a new batch!! That is simply ridiculous and displays a complete lack of standards and respect for customers. I just don't understand how that can happen.",1
"I really liked their special New Year's Eve menu. Service was attentive, if a little mixed up (we got our amuse after our entrees). The food was delicious and plentiful. Good wine choices and you can also bring your own bottle for a $15.00 corking fee. The music was sometimes a little loud but we were sitting right under a speaker. I'd go again.",3
"My wife and I went to Miller tavern for New Years Eve for dinner. We were lucky enough to get a space in their limited parking lot and learned that otherwise you must pay in the adjoining lot. We were greeted and sat promptly. We sat on the balcony patio and were met by our server. She was pleasant, but hard to find at numerous times during dinner. My wife ordered a mushroom ravioli which was wonderful, and I ordered the beef tenderloin. I was shocked when the beef arrived as it was quite a small portion and it was an end. Aside from the portion size, it was done perfectly and tasted amazing. I just though I'd be getting a little bit more for the price. Overall we had a good time and enjoyed ourselves",2
I have eaten at the Miller Tavern several times and have always felt welcome. The food and service is very good.,3
A first class dinner for the four of us to mark a special occasion.,4
Especially service was very bad.,0
"We had our annual Christmas luncheon at Miller's last Friday and it was excellent. We had the turkey lunch special which set the tone for the upcoming holiday. The food was wonderful, as always, and the service was extremely good as the restaurant was packed. I would recommend the Miller's Tavern to anyone looking for a special restaurant.",4
The Miller Tavern offers a 3 course brunch. The brunch was very good. I would recommend The Miller Benedict.,3
"The service was quite good, although the attitude of the waiter was not the best. Not helpful and had an edge to him. Did not seem to be interested in helping us and clearly was upset that we brought in a few bottles of wine. We did order wine and champagne. He was not friendly at all and did not show any interest in his job. That was quite disappointing.",3
Fine for lunch; not too crowded or noisy and service was prompt,3
"The greeting on arrival was warm , waiter Howard was great efficient and the food was delicious hot and nicely presented. Would definitely go back again Roz",3
"A renovated land mark. Tavern is in it's name, but far from that, it is a fine dining experience. A wide range on the menu and a ""Festive"" menu right now. We were greeted at the door before taken to our table. They have a full bar, ground level, busy on a Friday at 6! We were served with a complimentary anti pasta prior to ordering, a nice effect. Started with a shrimp cocktail, 5 large tasty shrimps, homemade cocktail sauce. Our entr√©e, Grilled Salmon, normally served a little rare, our waiter asked if that was suitable? We both wanted it cooked a little more, he ordered it medium, which was fantastic. It was my friends b-day, she was presented with a complimentary dessert to die for, both of us coffee's! It was an impressive evening!",4
"I was disappointed with the food. My entree was lukewarm and tasted so-so. Although our server was friendly and personable, it took forever for her to take our order and then get the bill after our meal. I had been to the Miller Tavern several times before at the request of friends and experienced the same issues.",1
"The restaurant is a great location mid way from folks outside of town and folks in town. Food is good, service is fine but not stellar.",2
"Overall we felt that we wouldn't go back. We had decided that maybe this would be our ""once a month"" outing with some friends. The service and overall atmosphere from the staff was fantastic. They couldn't do enough for us and were very accommodating. We had asked for Medium roast beef and it came well done and the food was cold. I sent mine back and then didn't get my Yorkshire pudding. Our waitress was amazing throughout. We also felt the wines were a tad too expensive. Perhaps they could offer a house carafe of wine to go with the fixed prix menu.",2
"Sunday evening dinner - would not recommend.

PROS: It has its own private parking lot. Our server was very pleasant and attentive. He made sure to accomodate our requests. Food was served in a timely manner despite two large parties upstairs.

CONS: I tried the Roast Turkey dinner. I figured if I liked what they had to offer, we'd come back and try their steak. The turkey dinner came with 'mashed' potatoes, veg, cran sauce, stuffing and gravy. The potatoes were still large chunks, not creamy or mashed with no flavour. The gravy was lackluster. I did not enjoy the stuffing but that is my own personal preference. I've had much better turkey roasts elsewhere. Will not come back if they can't do proper mashed potatoes to have with steak.",1
"After reading some reviews on line that weren't so favourable, I was pleasantly surprised by the food. We enjoyed their Fall specials, and my husband some the oysters and mussels off their main menu and all were beautifully prepared, sizeable portions that tasted great. We loved the location and atmosphere and will definitely return.",3
Very disappointed to find no sliced turkey and mashed potatoes on the lunch menu on Thanksgiving Day. Place seemed understaffed so service was slow.,2
"Food is always good.. never in question .. attitude and service is.

Inability of wait staff and management to admit a mistake ruined our date night out. What was a 'go to' place for us (at least 3-4 times a year) now has turned into a question.. ""Would we ever go back?""",2
"We were particularly impressed by our waitress- sorry that I can't remember her name (red-head). In addition to her great service, she very thoughtfully brought my friend who was celebrating a birthday a slice of pumpkin cheesecake. A lovely touch! Thanks.",3
"The Miller Tavern is a restaurant that my husband and I go to a lot; especially to celebrate events such as our Anniversary. For the restaurant to have a quiet night, the service was ok. The apps and dessert (vanilla creme brulee) were delicious and food very good; the only thing that we noticed is that my husband's yorkshire pudding was burnt.",3
"Always solid place to go. Easy to get a table, great atmosphere and food. Only negative is that I ordered a 5oz glass of wine after having a cocktail and got and was charged for a 7oz despite clearly asking for 5 - by the time it came it was already poured, waitress didn't respond to my comment to her that it looked much bigger then 5oz. Not sure if she didn't realize she got it wrong or she realized and didn't want to fix it, but I confirmed when the bill came that she did infact get the order wrong and nothing was done about it.",2
"Miller Tavern normally is a choice for evening meals and weekend brunches. This visit shows it is a good place for lunch, too.",4
Always lovely food. Wonderful polite staff.,3
"We lucked out with a beautiful day for lunch. We sat on the open balcony and enjoyed the view along with a great meal.
We are planning our next lunch, same place for sure.",4
"We attended this upscale local restaurant (20 min walk) for the first time, using a $25 coupon we got in the mail.
Service was friendly and mostly excellent as was the food. My wife found the calamari one of the best ever, the shrimp cocktail was generous, the steak was tasty and the scallops were wonderful.
We go to restaurants of this class about 3 times per year. This is one we will visit again.

(We enjoy good wine and they have a good wine list, however we brought our own bottle for their $15 corkage fee. We appreciate their no hassle approach to this.)",4
As usual I can't say enough about this place which is why I dine there frequently. The food is outstanding and the service exceptional. Recently the restaurant made a mistake on a meal that was ordered at my table and in fine Miller fashion they went overboard to rectify the error in the midst of profuse apologies. The extent to which this restaurant went to insure they recovered from this mishap was most appreciated. This is a restaurant that does not only offer some of the best meals but it knows how to satisfy a customer and keep them coming back. I have nothing but high marks for this place.,4
"All round a lovely evening! Attentive, friendly service; tasty, well prepared food; a relaxed casual chic atmosphere - plus a big free parking lot, making for a stress free evening. The lovely Hogs Hollow setting is also great for a pleasant after dinner walk in the warmer weather.",3
"I eat there about 2 times a month. While the prices are a tad expensive you can always rely on great food and ample portions. The service continues to exceed expectations. This place is always busy - it's a great spot commuting wise - near the subway and with ample parking. It has a variety of atmospheres all rolled up in one great package - the bar, the outdoor patios and the more formal dining room. But of course the most important aspect is the food which really is wonderful. It is nice to know there is a reliable favorite where you always walk away happy with your choice and have had an enjoyable evening. I will continue to make the Miller my number one spot for eating out.",4
"The Miller is a favourite spot to meet friends who live north of the city. The food is not as good these days ,but the service is the best. Servers rember what you like and are unfailingly attentive. The menu now leans more to a steak house, which isn't my preference but they still offer the best seafood salad platter in town.",2
"Staff is friendly, food is delicious, and I can always get a booth!! Love the new fall menu... Turkey Cobb is amazing!",4
let's bring down the music please - any otherwise terrific restaurant isn't because it's so noisy.,2
"Went there for Labour Day dinner. Service not good. Server forgot the soup and salad course til main was served.
Thought the food was poor quality. I have been there several times before so took a friend to celebrate . I was embarrassed at the food quality.
Would not go there again.",0
A favourite brunch/lunch venue.,3
"We had a great meal and an absolutely gem of a waitress. In fact, all the staff that we encountered were cheerful and helpful which definitely added to the experience.",3
The waitress who served us was the most grumpy person in the entire world. The hostess at the Door was very friendly however the waitress who served us was not pleasant at all. She kept giving us an image of we are interrupting her everytime we asked her questions about the menu. May be she was busy or working in short staff... she seemed that she was very stressed out. Since AC seems not working properly on humid day that can be a cause for her being grumpy. I would definitely not go back for this kind of service when I need to pay more than 50$for my special day dinner. I hope she understands that being nice and offering friendly service are the biggest part of her job,1
"This is not my first visit to the Miller, however I figured we'd give it yet another shot. I find it expensive for the quality of food served and the so-so service, and will probably not return or recommend it to others.",1
"A SMALL WEDDING TOOK PLACE, AT THE CLOSED IN PATIO. WE WE'RE LUCKY, TOO BE ONLY A FEW TABLES AWAY. WE ATE OUR DINNER AND GOT TO WATCH THE WHOLE CEREMONY. WE THOUGHT ""WHAT A GREAT IDEA TO HAVE A WEDDING HERE"". IT WAS SO LOVELY. WE HAVE BEEN TO TONS OF WEDDINGS ... I THINK THIS WAS THE NICEST ONE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO. EVEN THOUGH ""WE WEREN'T INVITED"".",4
Always reliable service and good quality food. Easy to remember to come back with groups. Great location near to 401 as well.,3
"Went to celebrate mom's birthday with enitre family, service was excellent and they did some very nice extra desserts for the table. Food was not really hot when it came out but everyone enjoyed thier meal. All in all a great evening!",3
"Food was very enjoyable, atmosphere was cozy. Our waiter Howie, made the experience even better.",3
Ruins the otherwise lovely outdoor patio. The smokers are not separated to one level so it ends up that smoke floats in your face but the food was very tasty and once we moved inside it was ok.,3
"We requested and received a table in the glassed-in veranda, right by an open window. It was glorious July day so we were able to enjoy the air without actually eating outside. Perfect!

We had the choice of either the brunch or the lunch menu, which satisfied both of our preferences. Both the Cobb Salad and the Eggs Benedict were very satisfying. Our server was a bright and cheery young woman who adjusted our bill without being asked when the blood orange drink was a sweet pop rather than the expected orange juice and soda.

I was with a twenty something nephew but I have been there previously for lunch on the ground floor with a ninety year old mother and have been satisfied every time.",3
"Great spot for outdoor dining on a warm summer evening. Staff were very attentive and food was delicious.
Highly recommend for a patio night out!",3
"We had a great time, celebrating a birthday with the Sunday Prime Rib dinner at The Miller. Service was excellent and the meal was very, very good. The Prime Rib was served promptly after salads and all of the meal was top notch. Bill, including tip, for 4 was a reasonable, at just over $50.00 per person. We had a round of drinks to start and everyone had salads, full Prime Rib dinner, desert and coffee. Service was so good that we decided to tip at 20%. All in all, a very enjoyable evening out. I'd recommend The Miller to anyone.",3
I found it a very enjoyable dining experience,0
Had the rib steak with baked potato. The steak was well cooked (medium rare) but was a bit thinner of a cut than what I was expecting. Taste was good - better than the Keg but not as good as a high end steak restaurant. Service was OK but had to keep asking for water.,2
"Great steak Dianne - always have this dish when I go there because the steak is so tender and flavorful and the meal has everything - pasta, vegetables and meat. The spinach salad is a delight and the service never disappoints. Great atmosphere, good prices and always a delicious meal.",4
Table was ready when requested and service was excellent. Food came out fast and hot.,3
"I have been going to the Miller frequently. But, this occasion was not up to the usual standard. To start with the public parking lot has been ripped up, so parking is limited. We got the last spot adjacent to the waste bin. The staff fumbled our order and the food was mediocre. They had to scramble to find a bottle of Veuve Cliquot. They don't have a California Chardonnay by the glass. Overall, this was a disappointing experience.",2
"Delicious food, great service and fantastic patio. We will be back soon.",4
"The Miller Tavern is a delightful neighbourhood restaurant that has a menu ranging from casual to fine dining. The food is always dependable and delicious, and the service is always attentive. The ambience is informal and relaxed. I always feel right at home there.",3
"This was our second visit to the modern day Miller and again we had a great experience, topped off by the waiter recognizing that there was a Birthday involved and arranging a complimentary dessert fondue.",4
"very noisy. All of us, 4, enjoyed our entrees. One salad had small amt of wilted lettuce but otherwise fine.",2
I thought the brunch was just ok. Not good food for the price. Eggs Benedict was very plain looking on the plate,2
Favorite patio in the city! Love the menu (ahi tuna app is amazing!!) Service is always friendly and attentive.,4
"We had a wonderful experience, service was fantastic, food was tasty and well timed.",4
"Four of us had reservations for 6:00 on the 22nd of June. We went to the bar before dinner and after waiting a good 5-6 minutes finally had to go and find someone to serve us. Bar prices were the same as hotel prices - high. Dinner was ""okay"" at best. The automaton (waitress) started her serving of our table with ""do you want tap or bottled water"". No ""hello"", no ""my name is"" - and it remained that way the rest of the time. The food came like on a conveyor belt - all pre-prepared. There was nothing special about any of it. Bland, undercooked, blah. The Caesar salad was a small bowl of romaine, a few croutons and bottled dressing - $9. Yikes.

I'm afraid we were all very disappointed - just not worth the effort or the price.",0
My friend and I enjoyed a great meal on the patio with attentive (but not overly so) service and good wine. Good value for the money.,3
"I found the lobster and shrimp coddled eggs on the prix fixe brunch menu to be a disappointing portion size in comparison to the other dishes that came to our table. If you are looking for something substantial for lunch, this dish is not it.",1
I come here often enough but I've never sat on the patio. It was a nice evening and nice ambiance. I was disappointed with the service on this visit. It was slow. At one point I had to flag her down to place our dinner order. She gave a face like we were bothering her. We had been waiting quite a while after we received our drinks. In any case I will go back because that is the one and only timer I had poor service at Millers.,2
"Great food, great vibe, nice servers, Excellent PInk Sangria :)
Definitely my new summer hang out :)
We had the calamari and the pink Sangria. For dinner, I ate some oysters and had the turkey burger with a side caesar. My friend had the chicken tacos and we loved everything!!
Such a great experience, Would definitely recommend.",3
"First time there for my cousin's birthday lunch. Very good food at good price! Beautiful location! We had finger food (baked oysters and poutine were very delicious), and the Pink S Sangria was fantastic! Will definitely go back again!!",3
"I've been here twice already. Our servers have always been really nice and sensitive to any food we did not like, I appreciate that. The food took TOO long to cook even though they weren't foods that normally take THAT long. Too pricey for the quality and amount of food we get. I got pan-seared halibut which tasted more like bbq-ed and dumped in sauce. I would recommend considering time to make the meals, again way too long. We probably waited more than 30-40mins! :(

Overall, service was good, sometimes exceptional. Takes way too long and too pricey.",1
"wonderful historic, yet cool, ambiance. Food was good, the wine list was solid. Service was just a tad slow but it was busy, so not really a bad sign. Overall though, very friendly folks making it a delightful atmosphere to be with friends and family.",3
"We recently dined at Miller Tavern to celebrate my parents 56th wedding anniversary. The staff accomodated the special request I made online for a window table and at the end of the meal brought complimentary chocolate fondue and coffee and spiced rum shooters to celebrate our special occasion. Our waitress was very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive as were the other staff we dealt with. The good was great. I would highly recommend the Sesame AHI Tuna appetizer- we all shared it and thought it was amazing. It was pretty noisy where we were seated in the glassed in terrace though- next time I will try inside the main restaurant.",3
"We dined at Miller Tavern last Sunday evening, to partake of their Prime Rib dinner. Service was really abysmal. The server 'informed' us that the beef was served 'medium rare', without asking our preferences. We asked for 'medium', and the meal came as 'medium-rare' nonetheless. The bottle of Pinot Grigio was served in red wine glasses. The server was blase about our dining experience, asking if everything OK and then not even waiting around to hear our response. She also was, inexplicably, hiccupping continually and loudly, with no apologies or mention of this annoying behaviour. We hadn't been to Miller Tavern for over a year, and thought it was time to give it a chance,but we won't be back again for a very long time, if ever.",1
Food was excellent - interesting menu and fresh ingredients. Highly recommend it.,3
"Me and my cousins enjoyed a great brunch in here. Food is great, service is good.",4
"The service was not great or expected for this type of place.
ex: the tea was served without a plate and the spoon was handed and left on the table
the pastries looked damages like they were stored in a very tight space, they did not look good at all.
they did not serve any kind of bread or butter
tea or coffe was just offered at the end of the meal...
this is totally innacceptable and more in a restaurant of this level
no relationship was created between the place and us.",1
"Overall, I enjoyed the Mother's Day Brunch. The only criticism I have is that we had to wait 45 minutes for our table, despite the fact that we had a reservation.

The restaurant was very busy so that is why we had to wait for a table. I think in the future, I will go to Miller Tavern on ""regular"" days as opposed to special occasions.

I was disappointed that Miller Tavern no longer serves home fries with the Eggs benedict. I felt that my meal was missing something.",2
"Mothers"" day brunch was well done, good food, good service and reasonable value for money",4
Theybhad a great brunch for mothers day.,3
Always a pleasure! Food is delicious and service is friendly. I enjoy taking clients there as I'm never disappointed!,4
"Thanks to gorgeous weather brunch ambience was great. Even though I mentioned one of the guest is gluten free, no substitute or preparation was made so wasn't able to enjoy any of the assorted breads. Bread basket contained mini pastries resembling the ones from local supermarket and salmon salad dressing had too much oil so greens were wilted and saturated by oil. Based on what was served, but overpriced for brunch. Server was very nice though.",2
"We arrived a little early for the ""Baby Shower Brunch"", but were seated in minutes of our arrival (asked to wait in the lounge area). Our table was in a corner, as requested; in the covered upstairs patio - which was a bonus since it was a gorgeous day!

Fantastic service, food & ambience. The weekend brunch was delicious - the warm Croissants are to die for!",4
We have enjoyed better service on previous visits.,2
"I was impressed with the complimentary amuse bouche, a lovely shrimp roll with sauce, at the beginning of the meal. My grilled fresh salmon salad was cooked perfectly.",3
We have been back a few times...the food is always good..the server wasn't as good this time( had to ask a few times for things) but she was friendly and tried hard. It was Sunday and busy. Food was terrific. We like it there very much.,3
"A great trip down memory lane for those of us who took in the Miller Tavern for a Friday night beer during our high school years- the inside decor has been transformed into a welcoming neighbourhood restaurant with a higher end feel, great food selections, and friendly staff versed in the history of the Hoggs Hollow location.",4
"A nice dinner with adequate service. Most of us enjoyed our meal with the exception of my son who ordered the lobster and found it on the chewy side.

The prime rib price fix dinner was pretty good value.",3
Steaks cooked to perfection! Thank you Chef...our steaks were delicious and service was fantastic! We'll be back for sure.,4
Chicken tacos are amazing! Great addition to the menu.,3
"The Miller is perfect for dinner with colleagues and for family groups. The service is knowledgeable and efficient. The menu has something for everyone. The seafood platter is the best bargain on the menu, delicious assortment of seafood on a layer of field greens. The burgers and steaks are amazing, especially for the price. We often take advantage of the BYOW option.",2
We enjoyed ourselves and the food was good but not outstanding. The service was very considerate and attentive. The decor was antique and rustic befitting an old inn or tavern.,2
We sat down for our 8 pm reservation. By 8:30 not one staff had come over to greet us or take a drink order. We summoned the manager who took our drink order and said the waitress would be over soon. 10 mins later still no one came by so we left. The manager offered to wait on us himself but we weren't taking a chance on such poor service. They comped our drinks but unfortunately we were done here. Too bad because the menu looked good.,0
"Enjoyed a birthday celebration in one of the private rooms. Spacious and well contained, our group of 30 was sufficiently accommodated and still plenty of room.
Food was very good from their preset group menu with ample choice of mains; chicken supreme, filet mignon, salmon or mushroom ravioli. A choice of two soups; seafood chowder and a yummy curried vegetable.
The steaks and salmon dishes were well prepared; I found the chicken supreme a bit dry but tasty; the ravioli was excellent. Dessert was a choice of creme brule, ciinamon apple cake or a double chocolate cake; I had the brule and it was great.
A definite return is planned.",3
Food is really not up to standard (particularly for the price).,1
"Excellent.
Staff was very friendly, cordial , welcoming and service was perfect. Our waitress was wonderful, food was excellent. Service of the food was impeccable.
Martini...was also amazing !
Compliments. I live in the neighbourhood and can't wait to come back .

Thank you!",3
We recently dined at the Miller Tavern for my father's birthday. The food was amazing and our server was excellent. We will definitely be returning for more family dinners and special occasions.,4
"My wife and I are from the US and we were visiting Toronto when we happened to come across Miller's. We weren't expecting alot but we were pleasantly surprised. Everything was wonderful! We're no strangers to dining out, but this was beyond exceptional. I thought we had nice restaurants back home but Miller's took the cake. The ambiance was perfect, the service was good, and the food was beyond perfect. We travel all over the US and have only been to Canada a few times but Miller's is our newest favorite. It is now a mandatory stop for us and really should be considered a gem of our ""Northern neighbors."" Thank you for an extremely pleasurable experience. Go Blue Jays!!!",4
"We sat on the terrace for brunch on Easter Sunday. Brunch entrees were interesting, tasty and nicely presented. I had the cheesecake for the dessert and I didn't finish it. Partly because I was full, but it certainly was far from memorable and I wish I had made a different selection. The waitress was good and accommodated some minor requests: a virgin caesar to start, and fruit cup for dessert instead of the options on the menu for my son. Appreciated... Good value for $27.00.",3
"We went for Easter Brunch. Food was good, but I left hungry...not so good.",2
A particularly attentive server,4
"Excellent, friendly service, very good ambience. An historic Building. Menu over-priced for lunch (i.e. burgers $15,with fries/salad an additional price; fish & chips lunch feature $20, etc.",3
Miller Tavern continues to be a perfect location for family get-togethers.,4
The crab cakes were great. I wasn't thrilled with the wasabi dressing on the ceasar salad. Our waitress was a little too attentive - we had quite a few interruptions. I would definitely go back. It has a nice ambiance and the food is good.,2
"The Sunday roast beef special was good for the price. The service was rushed - the first course arrived while we were still drinking aperitifs, even though we had specifically said we were not in a hurry. At our request, service slowed to an acceptable pace after that.",2
"Nice quiet place for dinner, intimate lounge area, great for large get together. Excellent service for the hosts. A dinner for 16. Free appetizers and a complimentary shot of Irish coffee at the end. Menu choices variety of selections, and reasonable.",4
"A great experience as we celebrated a 90th birthday with the family! The food
was super and well presented, and the service very attentive and friendly. The Miller's
a place we often choose for special occasions and a place I always recommend.",3
"I went for a special engagement dinner with some of my oldest friends (we all randomly got engaged around the same time). I informed the restaurant of the occasion when I booked the reservation and from the moment we sat down they made the entire event feel very special. Our waiter was attentive and service was not rushed or fussy. They even brought out three glasses of champaign for us at the end of the meal.

First time at the Miller, and it won't be my last",4
"Our server Tabitha was extremely rude and unknowledgeable about the foods she was serving and wines that were available. As a matter of fact, the service from all the staff was downright depressing.

We and our friends definitely will not be back regardless of how many spam coupons they mail to us here in the Bridal Path.",0
"Came for brunch with a group of 7 on a Sunday. Many classic brunch options, and the regular menu (burgers, salads, pub fare with a modern twist) were available to order from. Several of our group opted for the prix fixe brunch set menu which offered a cocktail, main brunch dish, and dessert. The food was very good, but the only critique I can give is that my apple cake was two sweet! I love desserts, so this was a bit disappointing. Overall, the Miller is a great place to eat, and the service is always excellent.",3
We went to Miller Tavern to celebrate a friend's birthday. I requested a table in a quiet area and we got a nice table upstairs near the bar. Our server Howie was exceptional! He went above and beyond our expectations and this was greatly appreciated! He made it a memorable meal so we'll definitely visit again.,4
Never disappointed with service and food quality!,4
"Service can be hit and miss here, which is a shame, because when its on, its on! Two of us went for brunch recently, and to be frank, felt like we had been forgotten about. Food was lack lustre, no one bothered to check in and see how we were doing...",2
"This time I don't have much good to say. It was a special evening and it wasn't great. We had finished a bottle of wine before the meal arrived it was that slow! Our appetizer arrived quickly and hot. The restaurant wasn't full, so I'm not sure what happened.
They did give us complimentary dessert and liqueurs because of the problem and that was nice but our meals were slow arriving and cold. I don't know if we'll be back, certainly not for a special occasion - we couldn't risk it.",1
"Food was amazing, goat cheese and beet salad,full of flavour.
. salmon dish, as always never lets me down.
Amy our waitress, pleasant, attentive but not intrusive.

This will be a wonderful habit, for the future..Miller Tavern.",3
The food was salty. For a steakhouse they failed at making a tasty steak. It was bland and the meat was old. The wine list is absurd. It's not a 5 star plus restaurant and there is no justification to pay $80 for a bottle of 2009 Robert mondavi. Ridiculous. I definitely wouldn't recommend this place. Go to the Keg,0
"Overall good tasting food. Bit of an issue with the Sunday night roast, but our server handled the situation in a professional manner. The apple cake for dessert was outstanding.",2
"We went there for lunch and the seating was very comfortable cuz its booth style. The service was excellent compared to other places cuz the waitresses were friendly and they were there when we asked for something. The food was great and its better than i expected cuz of other reviews. It does worth paying extra IMO.

I would recommend for other ppl and for special occasion.",4
"A pleasant restaurant for lunch, but the food is not as good as it should be for the price. The egg dishes were not very flavourful. The apple cake for dessert was the best part of the prix fixe meal. Our young waitress was very good.",2
"The oysters are so fresh, the steak was amazing, food was one of the best we have ever had! Service was efficient and friendly, most of the time they are so quick you didnt even know they were there :) Thank you so much for great food and excellent service.",4
"We've been meaning to try Miller Tavern for ages, perhaps my expectations were too high. The food and service were fine, and we had a nice meal with no complaints, but it certainly wasn't anything special. For the price I would probably have preferred the Keg. It was a nice change however. I should mention that we dined on Valentines Day, so perhaps a less busy time would have been more impressive? Worth a shot if you're looking for a change.",3
Had a lovely Valentines dinner without feeling rushed! Service was friendly and efficient even though I noticed how busy it was in the restaurant. Had the lobster ravioli special - it was SO tasty!!! my husband had the steak and he loved it!! Will definitely be back... Soon!!!,4
"This is about the fourth time we've visited Miller Tavern over the last couple of years and it never disappoints. Since the renos in January 2013 and the revised menu, the food selection and atmosphere are even better. My wife and I had an excellent dinner for her 50th birthday and to celebrate Valentines day. The Blue Crab & shrimp cakes starter was superb...lightly deep fried, crispy and very tasty with the added curried mayo. We each had a fish main course: three large scallops in butternut squash risotta, and the black cod. Both perfectly prepared and wonderfully tasty! We ended with a his/her chocolate fondue with a selection of fruits for dipping! We always ask for Howie as he is such an attentive server and very knowledgable!",4
Had the chicken tacos as per my servers suggestion and they did not disappoint! Our entire dining experience was great - will be back soon!!,4
"My guest and I both ordered Seafood lunches and the meals were tasty, very well presented with appropriate vegtables and the portions were generous. The service was attentive, but not intusive and my guest and I appreciated the available free parking.",3
I felt like it was dated and targeted towards an elderly crowd.,1
"This is our 4th time eating at the Miller and as usual it was a good experience. We like it because it's close to home and the atmosphere is fantastic. We both had steaks which we asked for med-rare...they were more on the rare side, but otherwise very good.The service was very good, as usual. I find the wine to be a bit expensive, nothing really good under $50, it would be nice to see a few good lower price options. The Miller is not our first choice for dining but it's good to know we have somewhere close when we feel like a nice meal and a bottle of wine without travelling to far.",2
Great food and service.... As always!,4
Was my first time at this restaurant and I did not get disappointed. The food and the service were outstanding! I definitely would recommend Miller Tavern.,4
"Right next to ACC, this is a good dinning place with great food & services. Comfortable seats throughout.",3
decided to give it a try after having a bad experience a while ago nothing has changed - service was indifferent and the steaks terrible - salad arrived without dressing and our onion soup was luke warm - server told she has never heard anyone complain about the thin overpriced steaks before - definitely won't be back,0
"I have been to Miller Tavern on several different occasions with family, friends and co-workers. Hence, my reason for returning for Brunch (this was my 1st time having Brunch). While my girlfriend and I enjoyed the new renovations, the ambiance and wonderfully priced Brunch menu and good food, I am sorry to say that Laura, our Server was less than engaging. She was very brisk and 'prickly', and did not seem to enjoy what she was doing...but rather robotic. She 'forced' a smile or two, but noticably 'forced'. I work in a 5 Diamond hotel in Toronto and have been working in the hospitality industry for over a decade and know what truly good service is. Despite this disappointing experience, I will return but hopefully not to be Laura's section",2
AWESOME!,4
Went for the first time after driving by for years- Pleasantly surprised. My lobster cioppino was very flavorful and service by Jason was outstanding.,3
"Food and service was excellent! Tabatha our server was extremely efficient, knowlegable and very friendly. Will definitely be eating at Millers again.can't wait to see the new menu after renovations.",4
"Everything was good. Except we were not given the option to have a table in the restaurant upstairs, but in the bar area, even though we made the reservation ahead of time.
We also expected a bit more New Year atmosphere (the TV fireplaces were a bit too much and not festive).",2
The Miller Tavern continues to serve the full menu until 11 PM -- perfect for the late arrival of out-of-town guests.,4
Great if you want to spend a lot of money for not very good food or drinks. Keep looking.,2
"I had a better experience previously at Miller Tavern during June, so I recommended to come for holidays celebration but was fairly disappointed this time. The server was not attentive to our table, and several food choices came out incorrectly- caesar salad became mashed potatoes, someone's soup appetizer didn't come. Although this was corrected, but this ordeal made me fairly embarrassed, and I likely won't come back again.The restaurant wasn't busy so I am surprised service was kind of bad. Not sure if it's because the server knows its 18% automatic gratuity and thus, just did her thing and kind of left us there.",1
"My wife and I frequent this restaurant. It is suitable for any special occasion. The food is good and somewhat on the pricey side, but well worth it. We've never been disappointed there.",2
Slow service but pleasant server,2
It seems to be getting very hard to find the perfect combination of great service and delicious food but you need look no further than The Miller. Three picky eaters with special requests - no problem at all.,3
"my burger was good but service was very slow, it was noisy due to large parties at this time of the year.",1
"I visited for lunch with a friend. The food is flavourful, interesting and well presented. Its a large facility to there is a good level of activity in the Miller which makes it feel fun. Perhaps its not fair to judge service at lunch in December but I found it slow. After the soup came, We had to ask for bread (which was a charge) It would have made sense for the server to ask if we wanted some at that point. We also had to ask for our bill.",3
"The food was outstanding,Salmon was cooked to perfection,great courteous staff and very helpfull, will return again.",4
The food was good and the service was great!,4
Pleasant experience. I would recommend Miller Tavern to my friends and would definately go back.,4
Never been disappointed at this restaurant! Thank you,3
Liked the confirmation - both email and telephone call. First time there for one of my guests and she enjoyed it as much as we all did (and do).,3
"Nice meal - we had dim sum sampler, black cod and rib steak. Everything perfect, and service was outstanding! Some special treats slipped in between courses. Perfect local restaurant, will definitely keep coming back.",3
"A group of coworkers decided to get together to see off one of our group who was leaving for a better position at another company. We put a note in our reservation on OpenTable, and the server sent over complimentary shooters for everyone at the table. Great service! They were attentive and the service was prompt.

Menu is varied with options for vegetarians, foodies, or burger & fries types. Prices are average for the neighbourhood, but servings are good sized, and the quality of the food is very good.

Will definitely be coming back here for work lunches.",3
"food and service were very good. It was a bit chilly in the room where we sat.
Found it a bit annoying that we were charged for a basket of bread.",4
"When I arrived it was packed at the front door. I was clearly in front of this lady who pushed her way through and hoarded by the hostess stand. When the hostess came back she never asked who was there first and served her first. I told her after that I was actually before her. The hostess apologized but they normally should ask out of consideration.
We got seated outside in the selerium and it was cold. We asked to move to the inside dining area and they kindly helped us.
Poutine and calamari were amazing. Entrees were good too. Our waiter was friendly too. Great service. The manager also came by to ask how everything was. The only thing is that the 3 of us all had a really bad tummy ache the next day (if you know what I mean :/).",2
The price fix lunch with the Seafood Salad was delicious and good value.,4
"The food is alway fresh, delicious and well presented. We were particularly impressed with the young lady who served s on the indoor patio. She was efficient, friendly, professional, knowledgeable and very much customer oriented. It's hard to find that in restaurants these days.",4
Excellent service! The brunch menu is excellent.,4
We were a group of 4 women (1 retiree & 3 still working) and Miller's was a great place to meet and catch up. Our waiter was extremely helpful with menu questions and he made us feel relaxed and did not rush us.,4
"Something for everyone here. A wide menu, great wines, and a nice atmosphere. Excellent service provided by a knowledgeable, courteous staff. Our first time, and we'll definitely be returning. The steak Diane and the pumpkin ravioli were memorable.",4
"Well done...first time in since the transformation.
Elegant, hospitable and great food.

Server was friendly from the bar but definitely far from attentive.",3
"Great food, great table service.",3
"We left after we had our appetizer because we thought it would be faster to go to another restaurant and order our main course there.
For the first time ever I had poor service. I asked my friend at one point if we even had a server.
It was not up to the regular Miller standards.
Too bad.",1
Service was excellent - yet again. Thank you Howie!,4
Fantastic food and good service but very loud.,3
Took advantage of the prix fixe fall menu--excellent.,3
"despite the fact that food came really slow, our server was very friendly. we enjoyed our meal.",2
"The brunch menu is quite good, and it is reasonably priced. We particularly enjoyed sitting upstairs in the terrace.
A great place for a Sunday brunch!!!",3
mediocre at best.  uninspiring menu.  a fairly recent place with an old school menu and lack of creativity.,1
Our group felt the experience was good overall but mentioned that the Meals were overpriced.,2
A very pleasent experience. The restaurant took very good care of us (it was our anniversary) and even provided us with celebratory drinks and dessert on the house. A very nice touch to a great dining experience.,4
I have been going to this restaurant for a very long time and I have to say it has never disappointed me. With the costs of dining out it is nice to know there is always a reliable spot where you will not waste your money. The service is consistently top notch and the menu although not extensive is very good as every dish has it's own unique twist. Often I am offered little extras that I did not order like a special desert or a small drink. That alone leaves you the impression that this place aims to please you and wants to ensure you keep returning. It is obviously a very popular spot because you can never park there. I consider the Miller one of my few favorite restaurants. The Steak Dianne was delicious.,4
"The menu selections are very blend compare to what the restaurant seem to be trying to portrait in terms of reputation, ambiance nd level of class.",2
"Great comfort food with a twist , service friendly and efficient.
Washrooms due for a remodel, notice is up - please add a change table!",3
"Went for a business dinner but there was a very noisy group next to us, which made it near impossible to have a conversation (and I am a 27-year old male who doesn't mind a loud scene). The food was average in taste and overpriced. Both of these things I could usually look past, however the icing on the cake was the poor service - a visibly disgruntled male server who failed to serve us quickly within seating, and had no concern for the much louder group next to us who were clearly bothering other customers as well.

Will likely give the restaurant another chance because the menu looked good, but I was certainly disappointed for my first visit.",1
Server was not very good at all. Staff showing us to our table was impatient as well. Food was delicious but unfortunately with the poor service it arrive to us colder than would have been preferred. The employees clearing the table were great but the server really seemed like she would have rathered been elsewhere. Unfortunate.,2
"Went out with a friend for lunch, we both had fish that was cooked perfectly. We had awesome service and will be coming back not only for dinner but now for lunch too.",4
food and service always consistently good and cordial.,2
My wife and I live in Guelph and enjoy coming to the Miller Tavern for lunch whenever the occasion arises. It's a great place to meet friends for lunch.,3
I had been the Miller Tavern a few weeks ago for brunch and had an excellent overall experience. So when it came to deciding on a place to take my mom and some family friends to dinner for her birthday I thought she would enjoy it; and I was right. The food was very good and our server was exceptional.,3
We all really enjoyed our dinners - thank you! I think the Miller Tavern is one of those rare restaurants that gets better over time.,3
"We liked the food except the dessert - too sweet for our taste!
Service was good although a bit slow.",2
The food was incredibly bland and over-priced. The service was inconsistent.,0
The food pairings seem a bit odd. The Halibut was served on a bed of mash potato with shrimp mixed in! Not sure what to make of that. Also a bit heavy on the salt. Not impressed by the presentation of dishes. Atmosphere was good and the service excellent. Had a good time.,2
I have the grilled salmon salad. The salmon was cooked perfectly to medium rare. I am very happy with it. This is not the first time that I ate in this restaurant. I have never been disappointed.,3
Had a great time here. Ordered the black cod. So yummy! Our waiter was super friendly and had great customer service.,4
"Food is way over priced for the quality. Special requests cannot be accommodated which is rather disappointing (lobster quesadilla minus bell peppers??), have to ask for bread and then it comes with 5 little slices at $3.50, come on. Bar quality food trying to act like an upscale restaurant but misses the mark.
Would I go there again, yes but for drinks and appetizers only and because its the only choice around!!!
And no specials, whats up with that!!",1
As usual brunch was fantastic. I love the Millers Egg Benedict and to finish off with a piece of home made Blueberry pie is over the top. Definitely one of my favourites!,4
"As regular visitors to the Miller Tavern we noticed that the food isn't as good lately, except for the amazing seafood salad platter - my pick almost every visit. On 2 recent visits guests were disappointed with their food - chicken curry & Seafood Padthai... WAY TOO SPICY & Roast Chicken TOO DRY & TOUGH. Now why anyone would order curry / chicken in a place known for fish and seafood (and also makes good Burgers & Steaks)is beyond me. But if it's on the menu, it should be good and it wasn't. I hope the Miller overcomes it's kitchen issues. It's one of our favourite casual spots and it offers BYOW privileges; a very appealing feature. The server & manager reacted perfectly, but the aim is for guests to enjoy the food - not the courtesy.",2
"Description on the menu looks attractive, but the presentation is thumbs down.  Ordered the so called ""Bangkok Bay Scallops"", fancy names and description, it's actually baby-scallops in buffalo sauce, like eating chicken wings.  The sauce is so strong that covered everything, in fact, the scallops are the cheap-quality frozen stuffs so they are tasteless anyway.
For main, Black Cod and Ahi Tuna were ordered, black cod had a heavy taste of butter, the Tuna was okay, nothing special.
And there was the third guest - a fly. It was with us the whole time, eventually land on the dish for about 5 mins.  Luckily we had finished the food, I took 2 pictures of it.

it survives because of its location,2
"Really nice outdoor patio for a warm summer evening. Food was good but service was poor, with the waiter going missing for long periods. Took a bit of an edge off the evening.",3
Good calamari and oysters were fresh though overpriced. Entrees were very good. Steak and peppercorn sauce were exceptional!,2
Everything was great as usual except the crab cakes changed! So sad!!!,3
"Love the Miller (North). It's consistently good and we usually end up there after a restaurant debate...
The brunch menu is excellent and the patio is lovely in the warm months.",3
Not family friendly. No high chairs or booster seats.,1
"Extensive menu choice and specials. Nice patio, with a specific smoking section on the top level for those who partake. Dining at the open windows area of the restaurant, first come first serve for this area. Great service and tasty foods. Excellent sharing appy's.",3
"Was a perfect spot for a long summer afternoon lunch. The food is OK. Well presented and good service, but for prices & reputation I expected a little better.",3
We sat on the verandah for lunch and it was a great venue making an interesting but OK/good food into quite a lovely lunch - I will go back again.,3
I'm so happy that I decided to bring our visiting relatives here for lunch. The experience was very pleasant. The ambience is great and the location is just perfect. The service was friendly and not uptight. The food was very good. We dined at the patio and it was very enjoyable. It later rained hard but we were amply protected. It was perfect because it wasn't overly noisy and not too crowded. We were able to have a nice conversation over lunch. Definitely coming back.,4
"I made a reservation on-line and was given a number to use - however the girl that was to seat us did not have the number or my name on her reservation list - so that system does not really work as promised - she did find us a seat never the less - cold water was brought to the table right away - great !! and menus provided - street noise and traffic was very loud at some points it was hard to heard our conversation - The waiter came and made a few food suggestions - with a few food jokes thrown in to make us laugh -- great!!!
I could see he was a very experienced and well trained waiter. he dealt the wine with experience, further suggestions - we place our order - the food came and the dish was still hot - the aroma fill my senses, the sa",3
"This food was disappointing. This is not the quality I have had in the past at the Miller. Some dishes are plated well others are a sight for sore eyes. 4 thin spring rolls on a large empty plate with bottled Thai dipping sauce. I have never seen Pad Thai look so muddy in the dish. I recall the creme brul√©e being amazing in the past with the distinct taste of vanilla bean...not this time. It was so shallow in the dish (roughly 1/4 inch) that when they torch the top to carmelize the sugar, it heats up the custard below. Not great warm. On a hot day, the restaurant, though air conditioned was uncomfortably warm. $4.00 for regular coffee is unacceptable.

On the upside, the service is warm, the fish perfectly cooked, not overcooked",1
"As always I have yet to be disapointed by The Miller Tavern, always welcomed with a friendly smile and great service and food",3
"The lunch menu is excellent not only in selection but quality food for the money. Pleasant setting, good ambiance for both lunch and dinner. Comfortable and great service.",3
"I've been to this location once before for their free-corkage special last year and thought the view on the veranda was amazing. Light breeze, shaded and warm. It was perfect for the summer. When my maid-of-honour and her husband came to Toronto for a visit, my fianc√© and I felt that the Miller Tavern would be a great place for a light dinner, drinks and comfortable ambiance. We were not disappointed. The food was great, drinks were tasty and we all left pleased. The location in downtown Toronto is also quite nice, but the patio at this location is MUCH better!",3
"Miller is great with consistent food and nice atmosphere on the indoor porch/patio. I would like to see a bit of variety in the brunch menu.
Our waitress was competent, friendly, and didn't rush us in any way. It was a nice place to meet a girlfriend and my husband was happy to see the coupon so he & I will go back.",3
Dinner was over-priced pub food with no imagination. $40 is too much for one pint of beer and a Thai noodle bowl that I could have got elsewhere for under $20. Not fit for foodies looking for something interesting.,1
"The food is just not good enough to justify the prices. For instance, pickerel was tasteless (except for excess salt on skin), sides were not quite as advertised. Servers don't know anything about wine. Service is adequate, not spectacular. We go because it is convenient.",1
"The food was mediocre at best and I could not with a clear conscience recommend this restaurant. The only good aspect was the service. The wine list is blasse for the ""upscale"" food that was depicted. I ordered the small tenderloin, medium well, with mashed potatoes. The beef was dry and smashed to flat and the mashed potatoes were dry, as if they were reheated the next day after they were made. I won't be back. Not fit for foodies at all.",2
"Service was good but the food was below par. good wine list, room was not that busy",1
I come back every time I am in North York - I love it,4
"very helpful staff, free shared desert nice touch",3
"Food was amazing . Left vey full. Will definitely go
Back and try there lunch& dinner.",3
The Miller is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in the city - best patio for sure.,4
"Excelent server,frendly,helpful,knew menu not intrusive
Food,delicious excellent presentation",4
We had an excellent dining experience at the Miller this week. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. We sat on the screened in patio on the second floor -- the ambience was wonderful for a girls night out!,4
"Got together with old friends for a reminiscent meal at our old stomping grounds ""the jolly miller"". Had been told by others that the new Miller Tavern was a far cry from the old beer hall scene that we had grown up with...but have to say that the service was much better in the old days. We arrived before the rest of our group and were seated immediately which was a nice surprise. The problem was that's where the nice surprises stopped. We waited 20 minutes to order our first drinks and by that time the remainder of our party had arrived... So a full table waited to be served. Incorrect dried k orders followed by incorrect food orders rounded off our evening. Food and service just don't match the ambiance and expectation.",2
"We came here for my husbands birthday and the Miller Tavern didn't disappoint. The burgers were absolutely amazing, but there are many more ""posh"" items on the menu as well!!",3
"As soon as we arrived for dinner, we were pleasantly surprised. Although the restaurant was semi-busy, the staff asked us where we preferred to sit (near the bar, upstairs, or out on the patio). And we didn't have to wait long for our meals to arrive. My guest had the beef tenderloin, which was cooked to perfection. The Miller burger was a great choice, although the bun was slightly too charred for my liking. The ambiance was fantastic and we never felt rushed. Service was prompt and friendly. Overall, a great experience.",3
"Although the miller Tavern is a nice place to try out, I wouldn't say they had the best food. I would say I would not recommend the place for a first time diner there, but I wouldn't suggest it as a first choice either.",2
"I was there numerous times for brunch and really liked it. It was our first and definitely last visit for dinner. I can understand the stress level of Mother Day but I do believe that a good restaurant valued its reputation can withstand it, unfortunately that did not apply to Miller Tavern based on our experience. The food and service were quite a disappointment.",0
"On an understandably busy Mother's Day the service was a bit chaotic, people were rushing and glasses were being frantically washed at the bar to keep up circulation. The breads were mediocre, the main passable, and the desserts too sweet. This was my first time there, was hoping to find a gotta-go-back place for brunch and found myself quite disappointed. Kid-friendly menu appreciated however.",2
"Great Mother's Day brunch. Perhaps a bit over-priced for what you get, but to be expected on a holiday. Portions aren't huge, but typical for ""fine"" dining. Some great options on the menu, and service was great.",3
I went for brunch with my mother for mothers day and found the food and service excellent. Mom was impressed.,3
"The food was good, and the menu had a great selection of different items. The booths upstairs are perfect for a group of 4, easy for everyone to talk.",2
"Wh had a good meal for a last minute booking,,, there was no real lapse at the Miller,, a solid Dinner choice...",3
"Been at the Miller many times. This last time was just very mediocre. Atmosphere is very nice , great place for a drink but I dont think I will book dinner there anymore. Last few times have been really disappointing.",1
The menu needs a change. I have gone to the Miller twice a year for the past three years and your menu is very predicable.,3
"Have heard good things about Miller Tavern, but my fiance and I were not impressed. Not a great selection of appetizers/entrees. We had the striploin burger, which was pretty good. The calamari was soggy. Our waiter was not on the ball with refilling our drinks/getting condiments for our fries. The busboys were quick and pleasant. We will probably not choose to go back, but will only go if friends want to go.",1
"Went with a group of three, reasonable price for a nice food restaurant. Many people are going with a group so it is not very quite. But it is very good for a group of people to go. We order the bread, oyster and crab cake to share; the maple butter is awesome. Two of us order to the beef tenderloin and one of us order the black cod; both of them are very nice but I still think the black cod is better:) A nice restaurant overall.",3
We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch and had a guest with us who was very impressed with the place. The food is very good and the selection great. I love the Dim Sum basket. We also like to drop in and sit at the bar when there is just the two of us. Great Bar. Pam,3
"I've heard a lot about Miller Tavern from friends, but never had a chance to check it out myself until now. The food was great, the service is superb. We will definitely come back!",4
"The brunch was very bland. The salmon seemed over smoked and the presentation was very unthoughtful and seemed it was plated in hurry.
The eggs seemed microwaved.",2
"The Miller Tavern is a venerable Hogg's Hollow institution.  It's great for families, especially for brunch, and the kids love it too!

The food is very good and the service is good.  Nothing amazing, but a solid neighbourhood contributor.",3
"Booked a last minute reservation on a Tuesday night and got a nice booth. Shared ""This and That"" appetizer(for 3 of us) - just the right size, a very good choice. Was nice to be able to order a red zinfandel by the glass. Main courses were the tenderloin and the risotto. The tenderloins were smaller than expected. One was ordered medium-rare, and arrived rare (maybe the server didn't hear the medium part?)and was pretty chewy. Took it home to my dog. Wouldn't order that again. The risotto, while tasty, was very rich, way too buttery and heavy. Wouldn't order that again, either. Desserts were very good - one cheesecake and one peanut butter pie. Service was attentive, even at bill-time (didn't have to sit and wait for it).",2
Good food/service and a warm inviting environment .,3
We loved our evening at the Miller Tavern. The service was outstanding -- attentive and friendly -- and the oysters we had as a starter were amazing. Terrific menu.,4
"The service is always excellent. My colleague has a number of allergies and our waiter worked with the chef to accommodate, helping her select dishes that would be appropriate. Overall experience was excellent - the food is always tasty and the selection is broad enough so there's something for everyone.",3
"The seafood Pad Thai was absolutely wonderful ! The portion was very generous. The service exceeded my expectations. My guest was celebrating her 85th birthday and our server, Amy, made her feel very special, adding her own personal touches. The complimentary birthday dessert - chocolate mousse - was divine ! I look forward to going back soon.",4
Food was very good. Our waiter was attentive and very friendly. He forgot my husband's pepper corn sauce for his steak but he made up for the mistake with complimentary dessert which we are fine with. Good for special occasion.,3
Had a lovely Easter dinner with family. The food was excellent and the service was too. We will return .,3
"Food was great and service attentive, but unrushed. It was my first time there, but will definitely go back.",4
"Service was excellent. Starter and desert were impressive. Calamari was plentiful and tasted fine but not remarkable. I prefer the calamari how they used to do it. Overall, great service and atmosphere. Enjoyed it.",3
Our waiter took the extra step and did an excellent job.,3
"I went there for Sunday brunch. I like the atmosphere. It's quiet and charming. A lot of good brunch places are over crowded and one can feel rushed. This place is a good brunch place but you feel relaxed. The service was really good, the staff are very friendly and helpful and the food is excellent. I got there at 11am which is perfect timing. It started to get busier around 1pm.",3
"Great place, Great service, and great food.
Menu did not have as many choices as I would have liked.
But I would still recommend it.",3
Had a great business lunch - food was great and there was a great wine recommendation from the server,4
Service was great but the food was NOT. The only thing you could taste in the ceasar salad was garlic and salt - couldn't really taste the rest of my meal because my taste buds had been assaulted by the salad. My impression of the pumpkin ravioli was that it was too oily and too sweet. Oh.. and too much pesto.,1
"Always enjoy the Miller.....great for meeting up with ""the girls"". Service was
very attentive but not intrusive. Love the little appetizer and end of dinner
liqueur....nice touch.",3
Exceptional corkage deal on Mondays,3
"Although pricey,the service is amazing. Numerous choices on the menus.",3
"This restaurant was great overall. Food was good, it didn't come out as hot as it should but it was still tasty. Chocolate molton cake was Aamaaaaazing. Loved our server Vinisha,very friendly with a great big smile. Definitely coming back.",4
We had excellent service. Enjoyed a casual dinner of good hamburgers and a great spinach salad.,2
We have dined at the Miller Tavern many times and are never disappointed! The lobster quesadillas are fantastic and are always a classic staple at the Miller. My boyfriend had perfectly cooked scallops and commented that the coconut lime curry sauce was amazing! I noticed some changes to the menu and upon asking our server she explained that they change the menu to accordingly compliment the seasons finest produce. This is such a great way to make each visit different and exciting. I can't wait to return to try their new seafood risotto! The Miller is the first places that comes to mind when I want to dine out with great food and service and an amazing wine list to-boot! Thanks for always making us feel welcome!,4
"I love this place and visit occasionally. Would like to see a friendlier, service (waiters). Not, that they did something wrong, but it was definitely not right. There is lots of room for improvment.",3
"Always enjoy The Miller. Love the lobster quesadilla, but this time it was either reheated or left to sit too long while other meals were prepared......disappointing...but usually good.",3
Plenty of selection and I've always enjoyed whatever I've had from the menu. There's something for everyone! Even fussy diners will be able to find something tasty.,3
The overall experience is good. The steak we ordered is delicious. The waiter is polite and has a good manner.,3
Great place with great food. Relaxing night out,3
Love the corn/zuchini tart they have for lunch. Vegetarian selection. Never feel rushed. Good selection for uptown meetings.,3
Really enjoyed ourselves. Was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. Will definitely go back for brunch,3
"I had a weekday lunch with two work colleagues. We were looking for a lunch location that was convenient to Yonge/York Mills, relatively quiet, moderately priced, and a decent meal. Three out of four, I suppose. The location is great, the restaurant decor/ambiance is good, allowing for our group to be able to carry on a conversation without having to shout, and the food was very good. What brings my assessment down is that, for this high price point, the food should have been excellent - instead, the level of food was more like that at Casey's. A little disappointing.",2
I was with a senator and every thing was excellent,4
"We frequently dine at the Miller Tavern and this last visit was another fabulous experience! The service was outstanding and the food was delicious! Our server was delightful and when an issue arose, it was dealt with immediately, with a smile and an apology! I would highly recommend a night out at the Miller Tavern!",4
Never get tired if this place.  Great atmosphere and friendly staff,4
"Our food was okay- mediocre at best.
Service was awful. Appetizer dishes were not cleared before our entree's arrived. My potatoes were cold.
Our server had to be chased down to order more drinks. She never came back to re-pour wine or offer other drinks. She seemed MIA most of our meal.
The server brought our bill, we hadn't asked for it yet as we planned to have an after dinner drink, I guess she had somewhere else to be. We went downstairs to the bar area for an after dinner drink. The bar was busy at least a dozen tables and we were told the bar would be closing shortly and it was last call (11:30)
A very disappointing evening out.",1
"dated, fuddy duddy interior, wait staff not great. Good place to bring your grandparents.",2
"Things I like:
Lobster Quesadillas, seafood salad, pumpkin ravioli.

Things I don't like:
-Being charged for bread without being asked if we want it (we're not in Europe)
-Ordering wine and being given something else without being told (I can tell the difference).  This has happened at least three times.
-20 minutes before a server comes to the table to take a drink order.
-""We can't do separate cheques""... lazy servers (not everyone but this has happened a couple times here).  FYI-They absolutely can do separate cheques.
-Lots of excuses.
*We have been here several times and have had so many inconsistent experiences.  We have given this place enough chances so we're moving on...",1
"I ordered a delicious dinner from their special winter menu. The waitress was terrific.
She was extremely friendly and accommodating. A very enjoyable evening.",4
"The Miller is a nice venue, I find their prices to be on the high end overall and as such I only rate it as good. It would be a great place if their prices were 15 to 20% lower.",2
"Recently had dinner at Miller Tavern and it was very good. Had dined here about 18 months ago, and that was not as enjoyable. Quality of food and service have improved, and this may just be the most reliable, well rounded restaurant offering in the north of mid-town, central corridor area.",3
"We have always enjoyed the Miller and this was no different ! Introduced some friends to it too !
We have a bond with them...from the Far Niente Days !!!

Cheers !!",4
Fanatastic from start to finish!!!!!!!,4
Food and service were fine for the luncheon. I haven't been at the restaurant any other time,3
"We enjoy coming for the brunch, meeting up with the family the location is great just off the highway for us and on the subway for our kids coming from downtown. Food is great something for everyone.",3
"We were delighted with the warm welcome at the door and the friendly, relaxed and knowledgable service. The food was amazing, I had the tuna special in a white chocolate truffle sauce and my wife had the Prixe fixe menu with the beef tenderloin (what a great deal).
The bottle of California red Zinfandel our waitress selected to go with our entrees was a perfect match.
Thanks for making this a very special night.",4
"The new Miller really does continue to deliver. Its an easy meal, service is fast and efficient without being intrusive. The introduced new dishes and asked my opinion and took the time to listen to what i had to say.",3
Very innovative prix-fixe brunch menu for New Years Day. Ordered three different plates and all were excellent.,4
"Food was delicious; every bite. Service is what was the shining gem here. I literally felt like I had a personal butler catering to my every need. And she provided this service without hovering, Great meal, perfect service and dessert to top it off - perfect!",3
"It was not the first time for us to go to your place, we go there wery often with friends.
If it was't good we won't go there often. We like the place and the food, the steak is exellent.",3
We were celebrating our adult daughter's birthday with a quiet dinner out. It worked very well for that occasion.,3
Miller Tavern never dissapoints - great food and service - thanks.,4
"A wonderful night out - delicious food, good ambiance, fabulous wine and excellent service!",3
"Once again, anothwr memoraable meal at The Miller Tavern. Great server, great food and a great time all around. We will derfinitely be back form another visit in the near future.",3
"Place looks great, very historic/traditional, but with modern upgrades like the nice tv's for sports fans at the bar. Service was already impeccably nice, and then our bartender gave us 2 free shots. The only drawbacks: wasabi caesar salad was a lot smaller than expected, and they could use more/better beer selection (need more microbrews).",4
We found that the food was average...not memorable. Downtown prices for neighbourhood location and setting.,2
"As always, the food and service are outstanding. This gem of a restaurant is not anywhere near the downtown core of Toronto where there are more than a few exceptional restaurants. However, The Miller stands alone as an established, above average restaurant for those with a discerning palate, comfortable place all on its own between here, and there... Toronto.",3
Our seating for an expensive dinner for four was in a glass room off their summer patio areas. This room was cold all evening and should not be used at the Miller during the winter months. This was offered despite a reservation made 2 weeks in advance. The food and service were good but spoiled by the lack of ambiance and cold temperatures. We have dined in many place locally and internationally in 2011 and found the Miller's wine prices way out of line with the actual cost of the bottle. If you plan on dining at the Miller make sure in advance you have inside seating. You can't call this fine dining (the menu pricing does) when you are served your dinner in an icebox with bar type furniture. We expected a lot more from the Miller!,1
First time. Thought it was going to be a road house type bar. Very pleasantly surprised. Business lunch. I will come back with my wife.,3
"It was my second time there for Brunch and it was a wonderful experience. It is a central location and an easy meeting point for friends spread accross the GTA. Our waiter was outstanding, prompt without rushing us.",4
"Just average food....nothing I ate would entice me to go back. Having said that, I would like to say that the holiday decor was lovely.",2
"I had reserved and confirmed. When I arrived on time it was busy but my table was ready immediately. That's the way it should be instead of ""we need a few minutes"" nonsense. We were told of their $35.00 promotional Autumn Dinner promotion and took advantage of it: good package price. Portions were modest but excellent quality. Stayed for almost three hours and never hounded to leave: Positive dining experience.",3
Service is impeccable and chef is outstanding in food combinations..,4
"Really great service - patient, friendly, enthusiastic, perfectly timed - too bad the food quality was not good at all. Sunday lunch for three (NOT brunch, only one entree each, NO appetizers, NO dessert, NO alcohol) was around $90 including tip and taxes. The food was dismal. I ordered grilled salmon and salad. The salmon portion was smallish (not hot, not warm, not chilled, sort of left on the counter temperature), okay size for a lunch portion. The ""salad"" was a pile of semi-wilted baby spinach leaves out of the box with 1/2 walnut (where's the cheese?) and dressing. My friend's Cobb salad looked a slightly more appetizing but not great.",1
Food was very good. Service was excellent. We will definitely return.,3
"Wonderful fall menu special including soup or salad, main and desert for 35$ - food was superb! A great spot for couples or groups that want to talk over dinner and be heard (low background noise). Service is prompt, friendly, and just attentive enough. Easy access by car or subway (York Mills stop). Will definately return.",4
"Food was amazing, but service was really poor. Hostess wasn't around to greet as we waited for 5 minutes while staff were just talking amongst themselves. They finally realized and sat us down for our reservations. Even then, they didn't really greet us and they didn't acknowledge us when we left either.",2
"the chicken penne was amazing! glad to see it back on the menu!
great dinner, great service, great restaurant!",4
Always consistant-BYO Wine with $1.00 corkage charge on Mondays. Popular nneighbourhood restaurant. Great patio in nice weather.,3
"The food is always great at the Miller. We have been here a few times for dinner, on this occasion we decided to dine on a Sunday night to get 1000 points and just have a couple of burgers and I had a beer and my girlfriend had a couple of glasses of wine...the waitress wasn't the most with it and kind of botched our order for both food and wine...but all in all it was very good, but expensive for burgers and drinks. Not sure we would do this again even for 1000 points. It is better to save the Miller Tavern for a nice dinner.",2
Always enjoyable.....the service could have been more attentive (forgotten item and sharing plate and generally inattentive),3
Great Restaurant overall with great Service.,3
"Miller Tavern is one of my favourite places to go to for any reason. During this visit, I ordered the Steak and Eggs breakfast from the prix fixe brunch menu and I thought it was absolutely fantastic. Two other people in my table ordered the same and we all agreed how good the food was. The steak was prepared just right, it was tender and delicious. Miller Tavern never disappoints.",4
Made our night with friends a great one!!,3
We were there last weekend for my friends 40th. We were thoroughly impressed that (from my special request for a nice table for that occasion!) the service staff brought out a complimentary dessert and we celebrated in style. It was great. And at $155 a couple we thought we were very impressed with the night! thanks.,4
"All the oldies from LPCI loved the Miller .
It was different in our day but a great place to relive memories which many of us did during the 75th LPCI reunion weekend",4
Superb restaurant! Everyone on staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. Food was delicious from start to finish. I highly recommend to celebrate special occasions.,4
"While The Miller does not cater to kids (no booster seats/high chairs, no kids menu, poured my 4 year old's water into a wine glass) we had a nice dinner. We went early, at 5:00, and it wasn't crowded so we got a booth downstairs. The food was very nice (pumpkin ravioli-yum!) as was the service. They don't have a kids' menu but they said for kids they make a chicken and pasta dish, which my daughter loved. So overall a nice evening out with the family.",2
Arrogant waiter ruined our overall experience.  Wouldn't rush back.,2
I think the location and ample parking space are two of the things I like to book this restaurant. It is a gathering and and family lunch. The young people seems to enjoy friendly and relaxing atmosphere and we are set at a corner table and with the outdoor view. Not too bad although I find the lighting seems a bit dim with the middle of the day and the feel is more pub like. Still I find the wait of the food is a bit slow but may be they just wait for it to come out at once for all of our party of nine. After all it is a good place to relax and have fun.,2
"Food was just barely passable.  Dined with 4 others, each ordering different things from steak to fish.  Nobody liked their meal.  Over-cooked, undercooked, and all lacking any real flavours.  Peasant fair.  The restaurant itself has a great ambience, location, size and view, but unfortunately the food just doesn't match up.  You expect so much more as you enter the place, especially for the price!  Service was average.  Not worth the money.

Won't ever return.",1
"Dont expect too much of this neighborhood ""upscale"" pub. The service was good, servers being friendly and attentive, however the wait wasnt worth it. The food, especially the charcuterie board, was a huge disappointment with only the burger saving the evening. For 3 people to have a sub-par dinner for $120+, I'd think twice again!",1
"Fantastic from starters and their signature ceasar to desert... lived up to its reputation.
Went there for my mom's birthday (she hadn't been there since before I was born) and they did a special round for a toast and made her night with the ""dressed up"" biscotti complete with a candle!",4
Had the Brunch Table d'Hote and was pleasantly surprised.,3
"Made every effort to accommodate our requests.
Food very good.",3
"The service was impeccable. Howie, our server for the evening, was so attentive, vibrant, knowledgeable and also extremely courteous! This was my second time there and bringing my boyfriend there for his first time was so pleasant. A great experience!",4
"I brought another guest who has never been to the Miller Tavern. We both picked the Fall Festival prix fixe menu items... virtually all of them in combinations. The Roast Pepper Soup and the Lobster Seafood Gratin were both tasty. The Spinach Salad was okay but no surprise there. The Beef Tenderloin might be bland for the presentation but the meat was really tender, juicy. Love the Chocolate Caramel Cheese Cake more than the Apple Pie. It was a busy Friday night, so it kept our server little tied up all the time. Yet, she and other staff had been very polite with their service as usual.",3
I have been there quite an few times and I would highly recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.,3
"Picked to go to the Miller last minute, and was able to get a reservation through open table. We were seated right away. Waited about 10-15 minutes for the waitress to come over to us. We ordered drinks and food. Waited another 10-15 minutes for our drinks (although she did bring us water before that). Then our appetizers came another 10 minutes after that. Very hungry by now. The main courses arrived almost immediately after we finished our appetizers. We would have preferred a few minutes between courses rather than have to wait so long for our first course. The food was okay, not spectacular. The air conditioning was blowing right on me even though it was a cool September evening, and air conditioning was not necessary.",1
"Millers has added a few new items to their already extensive menu. And they received rave reviews from our group when ordered. Service can be somewhat slow, but it was really busy for a Wednesday evening. Always enjoy and will return again.",3
"Lacklustre service and food. Expected much, much more for the price.",1
"Excellent value, excellent food and excellent service.",4
"Thorough enjoyed our evening. The upper deck patio was lovely and our waiter very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our meal, and also the wine, a Grenache.",3
It seems to have declined in quality over the last couple of years. Wasn't very impressed this time around. The patio is the best part about the place/,2
"Very good. The staff were quite attendant and pleasant.
We were there for Sunday brunch and would recommend it.",3
"Back for the prix fixe brunch again... introduced this neighbourhood gem to some friends who have not been there. While the Salmon Salad was great, the French Breakfast Crepe seems not to be as good as my last visit. The dessert was consistently good... as with the service!",3
"Summer menu offered tasty options; food was good and patio was comfortable, not too noisy.",3
"Wonderful! This historic restaurant has become a special-occasion favourite for our family. Thank you to everyone at the Miller for being so friendly, accommodating and warm. Will continue to recommend the Miller enthusiastically and without hesitation.",4
It's an annual visit to celebrate my wife's birthday (we do go there at other times as well). It's classy and it's local.,3
We celebrated 2 birthdays at the Miller and had a wonderful experience. We were seated on the upper level around a large table. No other tables were close to us and the large table allowed us to easily converse. Service was excellent. Everyone had a different meal and everything was delicious. We were all excited to dine at the Miller because of good memories when it was the Jolly Miller. Great renovations to an historic building and a landmark.,4
The staff who seated us were wonderful and went outof their way to accommodate our group but we had to wait for over two (2) hours for our dinner and everything other than the hamburgers was inedible.,1
"Fantastic experience at this restaurant, we had one of the best lamb burgers I've ever had, and a very professional authentic sri lankan curry chicken. The quality of the meat in the regular burgers is incredible. The wine list is a big feature here but we unfortunately were more in the mood for beer, when we return we'll check out the viticulture too. Seafood is a big thing too, again, we saved that aspect for our next visit limiting ourselves to trying the crabcakes which were fabulously filler-free. Highly recommend it. Birthday of one of our crew brought out a complimentary chocolate cake.",3
We have dined here before and will return again. The service was slow but 'most' in our party were not in a hurry. An apology came from the manager and we were comped a bottle of wine. Thank you and see you again.,3
"Great outdoor / patio place with a nicely diverse menu and friendly staff. The place has come a long way ... Try to get a spot on the lower tier patio, it's furthest from Yonge Street so quietest. If the weather's less-than kind the verandah looks like a good bet",3
"Dessert took too long and we had already let them know we were off to the theather.

Virgin Blood Orange drinks in Champagne flutes tasted like red soda pop - not like a $5 drink at all....

Staff were friendly and patio is gorgeous",2
"We were looking for a patio and when making our reservation requested a table either on the patio or outside. Our request was not accommodated for no good reason (apparently seating on terrace is on first come first serve basis). Making a reservation there was a waste and we watched 2 tables without reservations being set, only to learn we had to stay inside, which ruined the mood and did not serve our needs. Food was good, the value though does not reflect the quality. One of the plates was extremely hot, which means one of the meals was made before the rest and sat under the lamps. For a higher end restaurant, at least price wise, this is not acceptable. Service was fine.",2
Everything about the Miller was fantastic. Will make a point of dining there again,4
We went for a retirement party. The staff went beyond to make the guest of honor special.,3
"Everything is excellent. However, it was quite hot that day, we sat outside on the deck, the ceiling fan was not working. Thank you. We'lll be backk!",3
"Last time, the brunch has been impressive for our first visit. The time, we went for dinner and we loved it even more. From the appetizers (calamari), soups to the entree (sirloin, halibut, scallops, curry)... everything was presented properly from start to finish (a complimentary after-dinner drink) with no pretentious element and only just a few flaws (e.g. the steak could be more tender, the naan could be thinner). Definitely deserves more visits ;-)",3
"We always have a great meal at Miller Tavern. We had a fantastic waiter, Jason, the other night that really helped make a lovely evening sitting outside even more enjoyable.
We have eaten inside before as well and I love that the tables aren't one on top of another like so many other places. You have such ""cool"" flameless candles! I love them!",4
"I had gone to the Miller Tavern, with not so good experience. My comments on Open Table were shared with the restaurant. The restaurant, sent me a gift certificate and invited me to try their restaurant again. I went July 6th for lunch - much better service than previous and food is always exceptional. Thank you for convincing me return - I will visit again soon",3
I hope that we just caught an off night. The patio was very busy and I'm not sure there was enough wait staff. Service took a while and orders were not exactly delivered as requested. The food was sub-par compared to previous visits to the restaurant. The waiter/manager were very nice and tried to compensate for the mistakes. The patio itself is a great venue and is the best patio in the Yonge/Lawrence area.,2
"First time visitors to the patio, the food was great, the service was fabulous, we'll be back!",4
My wife and I grew up in the York Mills area and remember the original Jolly Miller well so it's always a treat to go to the new Miller for dinner. It has an unpretentious atmosphere and is always appealing. The menu gives guests many options from fancy to simple. We've never been disappointed.,3
"I had dinner with my wife during on a weekday in the outdoor patio at Miller Tavern.
In general the dinner and dessert menu are over-priced. The charcuterie board was expensive: small serving and unimpressive ingredients. My wife enjoyed the seafood crepe. It had hearty pieces of fish, crab and shrimp. I had the stuffed chicken supreme which was savory and the crispy skin was well done. The dessert was disappointing. It looked like a molten lava cake in a cup from the grocery store and it didn't have enough texture.
Although I thought the quality of ingredients and cooking was very good, it might be a while before I return to Miller Tavern due to the lack of variety on the menu and high price. I would also choose to dine indoors next time",2
"I love it at the Miller, the food and service are great, I've never been disappointed here. It's a staple for us and I'll always go back. It's a really great restaurant and I highly recommend - their TUNA STEAKS ROCK!",4
"Had a high expectation that fell short in atmosphere and food for the price. The food was okay, may have been what we ordered. Desert was amazing. The only reason I will go back will be for a desert and coffee/tea.",2
"Go for steaks and an incredible Sledgehammer Cabernet, but don't go for seafood as you'll be disappointed.",2
"Although you can request a type of table you might not get that when you arrive. It seems to be first come, first choice. We wanted a veranda table, but we seated on the patio. It was pleasant however, and we enjoyed the evening. Food was good and served as requested for special dietary restrictions.",3
"Menu is pretty limited. Nothing special about the food for the prices they were charging, however, the patio looked nice.",1
"We made a reservation for the Father's Day brunch and requested outdoor seating, but when we arrived only indoor seating was available. The service was very slow, to the point that it made the occasion unenjoyable. Two members of our party received cold meals. Also, of the three advertised special desserts only two were available. Perhaps poor management was the cause of these problems. The location is great and the food (when served hot and in a timely manner) was quite good. However, this was our first visit to Miller Tavern and I don't think we'll be in a hurry to return.",2
"Given the restaurant's reputation, I was expecting a much better Father's Day brunch than my family and I experienced. Our main disappointments involved the service and the food. Upon being seated, our server did not approach within 5 minutes to introduce herself nor set the table for 4. Once we finally tracked her down and placed our order, I doubt that even Father's Day is a good excuse for having to wait 20-30 minutes for basic table bread and water. Our desserts took even longer and when we asked the server why, she explained it away as though we were simpletons. The food was bland and not worth the $30pp. Plus she overcharged us and we had to get a refund from a manager. Overall, not a good experience; we likely won't be back.",0
"Food was well-prepared and enjoyable, but it's the service that was a real standout.",3
"Killer patio! Secluded, green and just pure nice, despite being 20 meters away from the Yonge street.
Food is ok, but overpriced for quality.
Not very kid-friendly: did not have a single high chair or a booster seat - despite over 50% population of the patio being families with young kids.",2
"My husband and I discovered Miller Tavern back in 2009, and we've been coming here frequently ever since. It is one of our favourite ""go to"" places for brunch/lunch especially for larger groups because the staff are so accommodating, friendly and the menu selection suits a variety of different tastes. The weekend brunch is my favourite!",4
"Service was great. There wasn't much meat choice except for steaks (5 to choose from, all grilled). The carpaccio was great though for appetizer. We had to resort for burgers as we ordered red wine.
Then a big problem, the red wine was colder then a white wine (and it's shiraz not a Beaujolais), the waitress told the manager but no apologies from him nor attempt to replace it. We had to warm the wine glass in ur palms like a brandy.",2
Met a good friend for supper and enjoyed the ambiance for that very much. Nearby birthday party did not interefere and the food and drink were very good.,3
"Server was great! Food was also great although portions could have been bigger. Great atmosphere. The only thing is 18% gratuity is a bit much to add to parties, everywhere else adds 15% which makes more sense. Overall a nice place.",3
This was my third visit and I was not disappointed - really nice variety in the menu and excellent service.,4
"I'd only been a couple of times in the last several years, but certainly don't recall it being this mediocre from a food perspective.
The server was pleasant and professional, as was the host, and the place is quite pretty, but I won't return after eating there.
Caprese salad had a good bit of buffalo mozzarella but only a few paper thin slices of supermarket (certainly not the vine tomato they describe on the menu) tomato along with a nice mint and pea puree.
The $24 seafood pad thai was inedible other than a shrimp on top. Overcooked bay scallops and little bits of salmon in bad noodles and ketchup. It astounds me that and chef would allow this to leave his or her kitchen.",1
Enjoyed our meal. Service great. Only disappointment was the Chef's Dessert.,3
"although we enjoyed the food, the service was very poor and especially slow.
may not rush to return there, although probably give them another chance some time.",2
Great as always. Our server Liz was a delight.,4
"The Miller is a perfect spot for get togethers with family and friends. Food is always reliable - try the scrumptious seafood salad platter. Service is friendly and efficient and there is lots of parking available. The indoor and outdoor patio seating is great for dining al fresco. The wine list is good and the corkage fees are the best in town if you like to byow. It can get noisy when if is a big crown downstairs, but we often choose a Sunday or Monday visit when the Miller is usually quieter, and sit upstairs.",3
"This was my third time dining at Miller Tavern, but only my first time having dinner there (I had enjoyed Brunch there two time prior to that).
The service was impeccable and the cocktails, starters, main dish, wine and dessert were all to die for. It was such an amazing dining experience that I would highly recommend it to any diner.
The only fault I could find with this superb restaurant is not any fault of their own: the location. As I am a downtown resident, the subway trip up takes a while. I heard through the grapevine that a new location may be opening up on the Harbourfront. If this is the case, I will become a regular diner of Miller Tavern.",4
"When I was first seated, it took the server 10 minutes before she approached the table to even ask if I wanted water. After the other parties arrived, then the service got alot more attentive. Food was good but not what I expected, slightly disappointed.",3
"The food was fantastic great taste and selection. The service however, was very poor and didn't really take care of us. Perhaps we were a younger couple dining at a ""higher class"" bistro. The waiter didn't even ask if we cared for any wine or cocktails!

Overall, not a good experience.",2
"Waiter treated me and my date like children. Just because we were younger (24 years old) than normally old clientele, there was no reason to insult us on our wine knowledge and act as though we had no clue what a Shiraz was let alone the rest of the wine list which in my opinion was lacking severely. Barely checked on us and food took forever (we got burgers and a salad). Burger was way over cooked from what was asked, and the salad was humorously skimpy on its amount in general. Certainty would never pay the silly amount it was again. We can get the same food and portions and sadly better quality at a Boston Pizza or Kesley. A table beside us had a couple making out and feeling each other up throughout the meal. Classy establishment..NO!!",1
Service was only so-so and I was disappointed with quality of food compared to previous visits. Mango shrimp spring rolls had no hint of mango. $15 lobster tail was puny and single tiger shrimp I got for $9 was not collosal enough for the price. It would have been nice if the red wine we brought was decanted properly instead of just poured from the bottle. Some bread with dinner would also have been nice. The steak was no better than what you get at The Keg and I will not be returning.,1
"Overall enjoyable dinner. Server Carla competent and extremely pleasant. Food good, prices a little high for what it is but not too bad.",3
"Really appreciated our waiter, he was friendly and helpful with questions without being 'overly hovering', very knowledgeable about the wine which was excellent. The food was very good, I am already planning to go back again.",3
"Normally I do not bother to complete these things; however, as a regular at the Miller I was so disappointed in their menu changes that I am compelled to write.I often go there for lunch and dinner. It was extremely disappointing to discover that they have changed the menu to separate the burgers from the side dish. In other words, my Miller burger no longer comes with a side of fries. Instead, one has to order fries separately and pay for them. The waiter said it is to give customers more choice. Also, he tried to sell us on a loaf of bread for $6 - regular bread ( from Fred's - but really). Who offers that at lunch to customers who have just ordered burgers? Fortunately both of us had burgers and split an order of fries. NOT IMPRESSE",1
"The food was good, and our server was very nice and did such a great job considering that there we were a large group of 9.",2
"Very disappointed. Over priced! Not worth the money. $3 for bread, which is basically a roll. $32 for bouillabaisse and it doesn't even come with bread! You have to pay $3 exra. What a joke. Pad Thai was served with cheap wooden disposable chop sticks. Don't waste your time or money.",1
"Sat out on the terrace, VERY COLD. Asked them to turn up the heat 2 times. Table beside us were wearing their winter coats the whole time.
food was good, but service was very, very, very slow; even for drinks. Getting the cheque took forever. Was disappointed.",2
"Even better than my last visit, steak was great and the oyster bar is always exceptional.",3
We had the best lunch at the Miller. As group of ladies only gets together a few times a year and one of our favourite places is the oval table upstairs at the Miller. The service the other day was impeccable. The meals were all to order - a number of us have food issues and they were accommodated quite nicely. Two of us were celeberating 50th birthdays and the desserts were fabulous. Thanks again for a great lunch. We will be back as you are one of our favourite restaurants for the group.,4
The food and service was excellent.,4
Great dining experience. The food was delicious. Great variety for brunch. I will definitely recommend it.,4
It was great as always. We were so happy with the new menu as the menu prior was not our favorite. We're glad to see the vegi burger back !,4
"arrived on april 8th yet recorded as no show, sitting near behind the stairs, order lamb burgers and steak, with beers, would appreciated to correct error",2
"I was dissappointed in this restaurant. Based on the prices they charge, I expected the service to be a bit more upscale and the food of a higher quality. My soup was not really warm. The lobster and shrimp linguine I had was something I could have made at home. There was hardly any sauce and there was zero flavour added to the lobster.",1
Service was superb. Dinner was good but Brunch was excellent.,3
"My public school girlfriends and I have been going to the Miller Tavern for years, 3-4 times a year.....it's our meeting place! The food is always good and the atmosphere warm...a great place to chat and feel comfortable!
Unusually, we are commented on our server's lack of attentiveness and rather grumpy demeanor this particular outing, but that is not the norm.",3
The service was very attentive and welcoming. I didn't think the food was worth the price though. Decor is a little dated. If it was convenient and had parking but I don't think I would ever go back for dinner. It caters to more lunch group who perhaps aren't as bothered by the lack of ambiance.,2
Food was excellent; service a bit slow -- but it was a very busy night.,3
I've been to the Miller Tavern several times and have never been disappointed. This time was no exception. The sever was very attentive and in a great mood. The food was amazing as usual. I would recommend it to everyone......Thank you,4
Everything was really great but of particular mention were the seafood platter and Miller poutine where were outstanding!,3
"Restaurant was terrific! Great service and food. Prices are quite reasonable for the quality but a dinner for 2 with wine and apps could easily hit $100. That said our for two was under 50.

Only complaint was the divorced couple with a kid one table over that were each trying to prove to the child that the other parent was a horrible person.",3
"The menu lacked choice. Very limited in entrees and selection. Prices were too expensive for being a ""tavern"" staff seemed pretentious even though given ambiance and food they should not have been.",1
"My girlfriend and I went for lunch the day before Valentine's day. Our waiter was great, though he was replaced by a waitress near the end - and she was terrible by comparrison. We both ordered the sirloin, medium well along with a lobster tail oysters and the daily drink special which were mojitos. Overall, a good experience - would recommend to others.",3
"Went for brunch with family. We've been to the Miller Tavern several times for dinner and always liked it. It was a very decadent menu. Excellent quality for a brunch menu, and very tasty. A little pricey, but you do get what you pay for.

Service is always top notch at Miller Tavern.",3
"This place was great. I took my lady here for a nice romantic anniversary. They were wonderful, the food was great and they even through in some complimentary desserts.",3
"The evening was not busy, although there were a number of diners. We were served quickly and efficiently. The food was great. Soup was really good according to my husband. I have many food 'issues' and they accommodated my needs very nicely.
Desserts were fabulous. Enjoyed and will return.",3
I thoroughly enjoyed my chicken dinner on a previous visit. It wasn't as good this time. The specialty coffee was not good at all and had to be sent back. The servers were very courteous and efficient.,3
"I went for the pre-fixe brunch menu and the food was only mediocre. It was very packed and we're placed at a window seat(as per our reservation request) at the patio. It's unexpectedly chilly and we'd to find and turn on the heater ourselves. I understand our server tried his best, however, he was serving more than 5 tables at the same time so the overall service was only fair. I accidentally spilled some drinks over on myself and the window, the 1st thing the server did was to clean up the window, not offering me a napkin which again was disappointed with the service.
I still like the decor, but I guess I would only recommend people to try it on a weeknight, not on any busy day.",2
"At first glance the menu didn't excite us much, but when our selections arrive we were very pleasantly surprised. Someone should describe the dishes more lavishly in the menu.
I had the seafood salad plate and the mango shrimp rolls (4). The salad was loaded with succulent generous portions of smoked salmon, shrimp, crab & shrimp cake, ahi tuna, and fresh crisp greens. The mango shrimp rolls were loaded with delicious shrimp and had a pungent dipping sauce. Husband's ""comfort food"" item of Beef Orecchiette bocconcini with snap peas, mushrooms and cream sauce was just what he needed after a very stressful day. We saw some wonderful looking plates of food being delivered to other tables also. We would return to Miller when in town.",3
My friend and I had a lovely lunch of 3 appetizers 1 glass of wine and a coffee. The bill came to $87.57 $100 with tip and that seemed high to me. I checked the bill at home and found that I was charged for a carafe of wine $14 instead of a glass. What now? I paid cash.,3
"I was encouraged to try Miller Tavern because I received a $25 off coupon. I had made reservations, so my friend and I were seated immediately. We only had entrees and dessert. My friend ordered the sirloin and I had the seafood pad thai. The food came quickly and portions were generous. The pad thai was very good, but not better than anything I've had at a number of Thai restaurants. My friend was very pleased with her sirloin. The service at the beginning was very attentive; however, by the time we wanted to order dessert, our waiter was nowhere to be found. It was clear that he was serving a large area, so I wouldn't lay the blame on him. Management would do well to add more wait staff. All in all, it was a very pleasant evening.",3
Convenient for my guest to meet at given different work locations. Service was great as was the food. The roast beef paninis were fantastic. The room was a little chilly near the doors but overall great.,3
"This was my second time at the Miller's Tavern. While I enjoyed the service & the ambiance, I thought the $ 21 seafood/fish platter - promoted by the wait staff as the best dish on the menu, was very small, & certainly, not overwhelming with either seafood or fish choices. It included, smoked salmon, tuna sashimi, 4 shrimps & 1 crab cake on the bed of designer lettuce. Not impressive. Otherwise, the space is spacious, the wait staff is competent & pleasant. A very convenient spot for a drink in the neighbourhood that's lacking in similar establishments. I would go back & try full lunch or dinner.",3
"Good place for a business lunch - upscale, good service, unique menu items. Service was very good - but it does, like all places, tend to depend on who you get that day. In particular, my steak was very good.",3
"I have been to Miller Tavern on several occasions, taking clients there for lunch and we have always been impressed. This night, I went with several friends. The food was outstanding as usual. The service? Horrendous. The waiter was extremely impatient and rude: he did not take our menus until asked, visibly impatient during the order taking, he did not ask us if we needed additional drinks or water refills or how our meal was, he slapped down the dessert menus and slammed down the box of teas in front of my friend, visibly impatient again while my friend was deciding. There is nothing worse than for a customer to feel unwanted. If this were my first experience, I would never return to Miller.",1
Excellent food -- attentive staff and waitress -- comfortable table but rather high noise level.,3
"staff was outstanding, service was great, will be going back and also have recommended to friends and family.",3
"For New Year's Eve dinner, they sat us in what is usually a terrace in the summer. It was overheated, we could feel the heat coming out and despite many requests we had to sweat it out.....too bad, all the rest was outstanding.",2
"My wife and I chose to celebrate our anniversary here. The Miller lives up to its reputation. The ambience was lovely. The food excellent. The service efficient without being over-done. The discount card we had received reduced the price enough to give our waiter a generous tip. Without a doubt one of the best dining experiences we have both had. Incidentally, because I had mentioned it was a special occasion, we received free dessert and a small Irish-style coffee, on the house. Absolutely recommend it!",3
We went as an extended family for a Sunday morning brunch birthday celebration. We were allocated a lovely table near a window that was also quite private. Our waiter was very attentive and the service was good. The food was delicious. The restaurant has a nice cosy vibe and you are not rushed.,4
"Hadn't been back to the Miller in sometime. The menu had changed dramatically from predominantly seafood to a more eclectic selection of mains. All of us enjoyed the food, which ranged from burgers to pad thai to a rib steak with fries, and the ambiance.",2
I treated a friend for her birthday - she picked the restaurant. She had been to the Miller Tavern relatively recently so she knew what to expect. I was last on the site 40 years ago when it was the Jolly Miller - so I wasn't sure exactly what the experience would be. It was excellent.We were seated in the enclosed patio. Table spacing is reasonable and allows conversational privacy. The temperature was comfortable.The service from our waiter was 'just right'. He was friendly and efficient but we never felt 'over served'.We both selected the tenderloin - the decision was unanimous - scrumptious! Will I go to the Miller again? You betcha!,4
"This was our first visit to the Miller Tavern. Friends had recommended it to us. Great place! Food was great! There were lots of choices -- and the ambiance is really nice also. They had subtle decorations for Christmas, and it was a really great dining experience. Great food and Service -- what's not to like. For fish lovers, try the Ahi Tuna -- for Steak lovers, the small filet and the rib steak were both wonderful. BTW, loved the biscotti option with coffee after. Sometimes you don't want the big dessert. It was the perfect ending!",3
"I get together with 4 long time girlfriends 3 or 4 times a year and The Miller has been our gathering place for several years now. The food is always consistantly yummy (love the Pumpkin Ravioli), the atmosphere warm and perfect for catching up with one another's lives, and the service attentive, but not intrusive. I recommend it frequently as a great meeting spot!",3
"The 'on the house' amuse bouche was a pleasant surprise. The portions are quite generous.
Not enough parking spaces though.",4
"Very comfortable sitting...could have sat there for hours. Our waiter ""Jason"" was amazing. He was professional, courteous with a great personality. He was attentive to us without being in our face. Food was amazing. I had the seafood salad...and the ahi tuna was cooked to perfection. Also loved that it was decorated for Christmas in silver, gold and deep red. Will be going back there soon.",4
Way too expensive for what you get!,2
Great food and service. I believe this place may be somewhat overpriced when it come down to it. I will be back at some point although not too often.,3
No highchairs for babies which is very weird but you can bring your own boosterseat and that's what we did. Not impressed at all with the service but food was very good.,2
"We had a good experience here. It's a nice spot.
The Caesar Salad was fresh and not overly dressed; it was excellent. My wife felt the same for her Spinach Salad. She also had the excellent Seafood Pad Thai.
I had the New York Strip; it was very good but not worth $39.
We were comfortable and not concerned about time however, they were extremely busy and the time between our appetizers and main course was exceedingly long.
We'd go back for sure!",2
The young man who served us was extremely attentive -- polite -- went well past the norm to make our evening special.,4
We had a lovely evening with good food in a semi-outdoor setting. Wonderful!,3
"Loved everything as always. Server gave just the right balance of service- knowing when to be at the table and when to we wanted to talk to each other. Our kids love this place-
but we do bring our own booster seats.",4
"I was surprised that there are no high chairs or booster seats offered for children. Especially when we were there for brunch- we counted 10 other kids who could've used that type of seating (including our own). This made dining rather difficult with a toddler. What surprised me the most is that there's a kid's menu - but no seating accomodations. Weird.

Our food was okay. Our server was knowledgeable, but very very very slow. We had an 11am brunch reservation (which we were early for) and we did not leave until after 1pm. Some of our food was overcooked as well- but we didn't have time to wait to have it re-done.

I'll go back, but not with a kid, and I won't be in any hurry either.",2
Our dining experience was exquisite. My father really loved the food and we all enjoyed the lobster quesadilla. A must try for visitors to Toronto.,3
"We took my mother (in her 80's)here for her birthday dinner and chose the fixed price fall menu. Mum really enjoyed her dinner - the soup and chicken main course were very tasty. Dessert, pear crumble was OK, but not as nice as mine! Crumble was cool in temperature rather than hot. Our waiter was excellent. Drinks are pricey. As a bonus we received a complementary $25 fixed price brunch voucher per dinner. All in all, a nice evening with free parking and very close to home.",3
Very good food and excellent service. A much better meal than our recent outing to a supposedly premier N. Toronto restaurant!!,3
The outdoor patio is great for a more casual atmosphere. The food was excellent (as always).,3
"The owners have done a really terrific job, the patio's, dining room and other areas are well laid out and the table-to-table distance is sufficient such that you do not feel as though you are ""involved"" in others conversations.",2
this was an ok experience. It was too expensive and not memorable. i had requested a quiet table and a large group was seated next to us before we left. I would not rush back.,1
Great restaurant. Limited menu selection. All of us at the table found the food very salty. When I told the waiter he gave a free desert.,3
Great salad and service. Will defiantly visit again!,4
"Very Nice restaurant for food, drinks and a very good atmosphere.",3
We have been to the Miller a number of times and enjoyed the meal and service. This time it was a disappointment with slow service and cold tasteless food.,1
"Great for outdoor eating during the summer, nice patio.

Food is OK, great for a bar, OK for a good resturant.

Surprisingly, the best thing in the place is the Dim Sum ... don't ask me why.",2
"Having been here a number of times before - it was my suggestion for lunch this time around. Prompt, efficeint and polite service - a requirement for lunch as time is of the essence. Our collection of appetizers were flavourful and served in a very short time after ordering. The place was packed and the parking lot full - so it is strongly advised to make a reservation. Definitely a place we'll return to - lunch or dinner.",4
"Great service, nice ambiance, good food, but a little over-priced for the quality of food.",2
"I always look forward to dining at Miller's and am never disappointed! Great service, ambiance, food and wine.",3
Need more wait staff during busy lunch times.,2
"Good overall experience, great patio, good food, will return....",3
Great experience as usual. That is why I try to go to the Miller as often as possible. The crab and shrimp burger is my new favourite for spring.,4
We had a great time and the food was very good.,4
"Waitress was somewhat condescending and not poised around our table, bumping into me and just not very professional. Prices for mixed drinks are obscene!",2
"The menu is varied and the food has consistent quality. We were surprised by the prices,they were higher than expected. $29 for Salmon, $52 for a Striploin. We dined as a family of 6 so the cost was higher than expected.",2
"We went for a Mother's day Brunch, needless to say it was a very busy day, therefore the service was a bit on the slow side. The food, while tasty lacked variety but the portion size was good. I would go there again but try a different dish for my meal.",2
Always good food and service to match.,3
It is a very strange menu. A few entrees for the $15 to $20 range and then $35 plus. Seems like they have missed the mark as to their identity.,2
"Brunch was very good although the waiter was a bit on the very slow side. Have been there before, and will be back",3
All good but outdoor seating area far too noisy for conversation at a normnal voice level. This is unfortunately a deal-breaker for us.,3
Very over-priced for what it is. Food is adequately prepared. Really nothing special. The only reason we met there was the convenient location. That pretty much sums it up for the Miller Tavern!,1
Absolutely FANTASTIC service AND the food was wonderful - a lovely lovely time was had by all.,4
Top retuarant in the neighbourhood,3
"Unfortunately the seafood selection, always the Millers strength since it reopened several years ago as a serious restaurant instead of a pub, has continued to reduce in range. Still, the food remains consistently good although prices are perhaps a little too high these days for the quality and portion size. Bar offerings remain wide-ranging and high quality, decent cocktails including an excellent classic martini (Tanqueray No 10 for traditionalists). Still a reliable, good quality and fair value spot filling the gap between Auberge du Pommier and Trappers in both linear distance, food quality, and price ranges.",2
"Food service was prompt and friendly, though almost too prompt...bordering on hurried. Principal dishes were good (had the striped bass and salmon), however the sides seemed to have been prpeared well in advance and did not jump off the plate. Seems very much like Canyon Creek or Keg type of fare, but with prices that are 25% higher than either of those restaurants.",1
The food and the service were excellent.,3
Too expensive!,2
"Restaurant is in a great location with ample parking available (ie. next to public parking lot). I really like the feel and look of the restaurant: tables are well spaced, seating and lighting are comfortable. Our waitress, friendly and professional, gave just the right amount of attention to our table. Alas, the food was a great disappointment: greatly overpriced for fare that could be found much cheaper and tastier at a Red Lobster or a supermarket's take-out counter. We ordered popcorn shrimp ($16 for plate 40% filled w/popcorn), crab & shrimp cakes, and calamari. The bland tasting bass (was it pre-soaked in water?) appeared to be blackened on one side and sat on strange tasting orange mush. I think they need a new seafood chef.",2
Not great food for prices they are charging. Service was ok.,1
We live in the neighbourhood and like the idea that we can take public transit to the Miller or there is ample free parking. We enjoy going to the Miller and over the years have celebrated several special occasions there with family and friends. We also enjoy the brunch. The food is always very good and the menu continually changes with a nice variety of choices. One of the best aspects of the Miller is the variety of dining and entertaining formats that are available from formal dining upstairs indoors or on the patio to the bar downstairs which can also be for dining and entertaining or just drinks after work,3
"This time we went for a Brunch, and our table was located in the terrace area of the restaurant. Always enjoy the view from Miller's terrace, there is a lot of natural light around that makes overall experience more enjoyable. The food was delicious as always, food presentation great and the service was excellent. However, the Miller Tavern's Brunch is clearly a family event - the majority of tables were served for 6-8 people, a lot of small kids, and a lot of noise. Strangely, there was no music, so all we could hear was a noise from a lot of people talking. We love Miller Tavern, and frequent it for dinners, but I won't recommend attending their Brunch for any special occasion. If all you are thinking is just a great lunch - go for it!",3
"Very nice brunch, with a good array of items on the menu and original courses (e.g. the wild mushroom French crepe was excellent). The place itself is nicely done and the space on the patio (closed off so it can be used during the winter as well) is very nice. Somewhat unfortunate that the patio faces a huge parking lot - a few extra trees for screening would make a huge difference!",3
The Miller Tavern is a nice restaurant in a great location. The service was okay - we had to wait quite a while for the waitress - but she was pleasant and efficient. I find it is over priced for the amount and quality of food you get.,2
One of the better oyster bars in North Toronto.,3
"I had an absolutely wonderful experience at the Miller Tavern. When we arrived, we were seated right away and our server, Howie was very sweet and quick. My fiance is a very picky eater and only eats poultry, so I was very happy that the Winter menu had a chicken entree. I myself had a rib steak which was so very tasty. Usually, I get some steak sauce to add a little kick to the steak, but this steak was very tasty and super large. I also had the potato cake which is super delicious. For dessert, I had the creme brulee and my fiance had the cheesecake, they were both delicious as well. I'm getting married in August and will definitely book this restaurant for my wedding rehearsal as they have a set menu as well.",4
"First time to this restaurant, their brunch menu offers many selectons. The food was great and the serving was generous. I will for sure go back and try their dinner menu.",3
"Great Food, exceptional Service! All staff was friendly from start to finish, a very enjoyable evening. Only thing that was a annoying was being placed at a dark dreary table in the back of the Restaurant. We asked to be moved and were very satisfied with the new table.
There were plenty of nice tables available and we were dressed very nicely.....not sure why this tactic was used but we didn't let it ruin our night. The food was amazing and will go back in the summer to try the patio.",4
"We found the Miller to be a very pleasant place to have a dinner for two with an interesting range of choices on the menu, food well prepared and nicely presented combined with friendly and efficient service.",3
"Our server was very nice. We were celebrating my husband's b'day that day and she gave him b'day cake and drinks on the house.
Overall very good experience. Will definitely come back.",3
"They must be doing something right. It was a Thursday night and the place was packed. As for me, it was the second time that I went, the first and the last. I found it expensive and not particularly good value. I had a provimi veal chop with a ""jus"" which seemed more like high sodium brown stuff. It was accompanied by a bread pudding with all sorts of stuff in it. If they froze it perhaps it could have been used as a hockey puck, but as for eating... pass. It was also accompanied by, I think, some spaghetti squash. Whatever kind of squash it was, it was tasteless. My wife had a sirloin steak which was brushing up to $50.00 and was not worth the money. I did have a good shrimp cocktail. I think my apple cake dessert was from Costco.",1
"The staff were very responsive to any requests we had. But, we found the food was just ok. Next time, we will have to order the steak, as I hear they are delicious.",2
Everything was good. Nothing out of ordinary. Potato cake had too much cheese. Basil mashed potatoes had too much basil.,2
"Never coming back. Our waitress took 15mins before acknowledging us to get our drinks, another 5mins to get our bread, another 10mins to take our dinner order. Our reservation was at 8pm and we didn't get our order in until 8:30pm. Our food didn't arrive until 9:30pm. Ambience was nice; OTHER waitresses were more accommodating, but overall, the food was nothing spectacular and for the price, it's SO not worth it. Thumbs down.",0
"Disappointed because original food ordered was not available, so two of the guests had to order something that they really didn't plan on eating, but generally good.",2
"Overall the experience was good with the food being very good. The Oysters were very fresh, the Blue Cheese Ceasar was unique, the Steak and Lobster and the Seafood Paella were both excellent. The service was slack, which may have been because it was after NYE, and a few details were missed. We were seated directly in front of a door which was repeatedly opened letting in a cool breeeze while there were multiple tables open which were not near the door which affected our overall experience. The wine selection by the glass was very impressive although a little overpriced. Overall the restaurant was good and I would recommend it based on the food and that I believe the service would be better on another day. - William L.",2
"Delighted with the service by our very attentive female server, as well as a warm welcome by the hostess...who also managed to bid us farewell in spite of being in the middle of her own lunch.",3
"I liked the abmiance of this place - warm and cozy.
The food was good, I liked the striped bass - it was tender and flavourful. The beet salad though did not have enough substance in it, i.e. not enough veggies, particularly beets ot other interesting ingredients like nuts for example. Service was prompt and friendly. I found it pricey for lunch. But I would definitely return for dinner.",3
"Service was great!
Everyone was very happy with the food selection!",3
"I've never been to Miller Tavern for dinner, but the lunch menu had an excellent selection of fusion food, and I am always impressed with the brunches as well. The service was a little slow though. But other than that, a great place for brunch and lunch with a large group.",3
Great atmosphere ...enjoyable ....good food ....had a totally great time.,3
"The food and service were great, but they seated us near a door that opened to the outside that they were walking in and out of all night. Not that warm in early December!",2
"The food was delicious. Each of the dishes had spices and flavours which complimented but did not overwhelm the food.

The service was excellent but discrete.",4
We were seated quickly and taken care of well by the waitstaff. The food was all very fresh and extremely well presented. Even desert was very good. No complaints. Recommend for dinner or lunch. A great spot for business or casual. I'll be back.,2
Food was good and should be because it is expensive.,2
"The upstairs dining area is very nice. Portions of food are large and delicious. Staff are friendly and attentive. If you eat too much, don't worry, just look at yourself in the (skinny) mirror in the women's washroom downstairs and all will be fine!! :)",2
"Excellent service & very nice decor. No food was ordered, just a bottle of wine.",3
"The Brunch Menu was dissapointing. Our guests had dietary concerns and with no substitutions allowed, were forced to make bad choices. The dim sum was over steamed, too much of the same and served unimaginatively and the Brunch burger - scrambled egg, pastrami and cheese on a bun was dreadful!!!!!! On the other hand, I'm sure the Miller Bernedict would have been a good bet. Perhaps a fresh fruit or cheese plate could have been added to the dessert choices for diabetics and other health concerned diners.

I have been to the Miller before for dinner and each time had a most enjoyable meal so brunch was a let down - mind you the price was good.",2
"Despite being booked solid with several groups, the food was excellent and service was fast and efficient.

Food portions could be smaller everyone had difficulty finishing their order.",3
Great as always !!! Fabulous spot for a business lunch !!,3
"Open table allowed me to create and change (three times!) my reservation time. From the time that my party of five arrived, we were greeted kindly and shown to our table in the lower level. Due to our late reservation time, we could not eat in the upper dining room. This did not disuade the five of us from recieving attentiveness from our server. It was as if we were in the dining room! The only thing that kept us from fully feeling that experience was the exuberent crowd that stood in front of the bar area. It sounded like a rugby team after a game! I recommend taking them up on the $50 per person app/main/dessert & ice wine deal and, still walk out with a $25 voucher for Saturday brunch! We will definately return!",3
"A little pricey, but service is professional with a good wine list. Not the most inventive food preparation, but executed almost flawlessly. Nice patio in a valley for summer days.",2
"Thanks for a wonderful dinner my friends birthday was great she really enjoyed the chocolate cake with pecans!! Thanks Lisa for being a great server thanks for making my friends birthday a success. I use to go to the Miller when it was a drinking hole what a difference. Hats off to Head Chef Kerr great job!
Cathy Cantor",4
"Dining experience was great, as usual. Always love to go to the Miller Tavern. I use it for business lunches, after work get togethers, meeting with friends, family dinners, and meeting that special someone.

Our office has attended the St. Patricks Day celebration the last two years, and we attended the ""Official Opening of the patio"" this year. Great events to attend!",4
"Trendy yet subtle, nice atmosphere. Comfortable dining and very attentive staff. Good food presentation and delicious.",3
"As always, an ideal target for out-of-town guests. They always enjoy the ambiance, and the fact that one isn't rushed.",3
"The Miller Tavern is a nice neighbourhood restaurant; the overall ambiance is good especially on the patio. I have enjoyed eating there on previous occasions. However, this time I found that I did not enjoy the food as much.

For example, I had a dozen Malpeque oysters and found them a bit gritty. I was at Rodney's Oyster House last week and I enjoyed the oysters more. Maybe they had an off night but I was expecting a bit more.

It wasn't all bad though. We were there on a Tuesday night and Ontario wine was 50% off; this was a nice touch. The entree (I had the salmon) was also okay as well.

Overall, the meal was okay but not outstanding. However, I will give them another chance in the future.",2
"We were a group of 4, going out for a small celebration. Our two friends had been to Miller Tavern when it was known as the Jolly Miller and were impressed with the renovations and more upscale ambience. My husband and I had never been there before and we thought it was nice, with a good outdoor dining space and large glassed-in patio. The service from Peter Z was great and we appreciated his ability to customize some of our meals. The wine selection is fabulous for a neighbourhood restaurant like this. I would highly recommend a visit if you haven't been there for a while or are in the area.",3
"Listed as a fine dining seafood, but no table clothes, nice candle lites. Servers were friendly but not fine dining quality. Very nice landmark, gorgeous building, 2 tiered patio, screened in area and downstairs bar/lounge for eating, upstairs has the air conditioned dining room, many rooms off the front for a larger private party, a nice variety of choices to eat in. Large menu, with many good appy's and mains! Not as expensive as we thought it would be for the area and restaurant type, which was a nice surprise! Some great deals offered on certain days of the week, listed on the menu with regards to wine and corkage. Overall nice dinner out, would come again.",2
"This is a nice neighbourhood spot for lunch - however it isn't an inexpensive option so my expectations are high when it comes to the quality of the food served. The mains are usually fairly good, but the dessert wasn't quite as fresh as I would have liked.",2
"A very nice experience with attention paid to all the details. The waiter happily brought water and gave us a reasonable amount of time to review the tasty and wide-ranging menu items. I enjoyed my simple meal of carrot soup and delsightfully tasty, crispy, spring rolls.",3
The Miller is an excellent restaurant in the hood!,3
Sea Food Platter made a great lunch. Creme Brule was as exciting as could be but wish I had of had the Pecan Tart. Always a great lunch.,3
"Place was quite busy for a Monday night. Food is good but, for the price, there is better in the city.",2
"The brunch fixed prixe menu was very rich with heavy sauces, breads and fried. Recommend including some lighter egg dishes such as a veggie frittata (vs quiche)with side salad or fruit. I passed on the brunch menu and was dissappointed in the lunch fare.",2
"Food was very good, but we were seated next to the banquet room where a family party was getting out in the middle of our meal.",2
Two friends and I went for the prix-fixed brunch and found the menu offered great variety. We each ordered different items (some from the regular lunch menu) and were pleased with the freshness of all foods as well as the portion sizes. Staff and servers were professional and prompt. We have already decided on a date for a return visit.,4
I was really impressed walking into the restaurant with the vast patio. I quickly lost interest in this when the service was slow and when my food did finally arrive it was far below par - my tenderloin was overdone and my lobster was rubber.,1
"Decent enough ambience and food but the service was brutal for a place charging premium prices and positioned as an ""upscale"" restaurant. There was not enough wait staff on the Friday we visited but even still, our server disappeared for 20 minutes at a time & constantly forgot requests. No explanations or apologies until the end of the evening when he noticed our party of 6 was getting frustrated.",1
"We had a lovely dinner outside on the patio. Good but not excellent service. Food was tasty but a bit pricey for the dishes. Why are lobster quesadillas so expensive when price of lobster has come down so much lately?
Overall though a very enjoyable meal.",3
I was so excited when I learned that the Miller Tavern joined the OpenTable system. I love this restaurant - a favourite amongst my family and friends - and a neighbourhood gem.,4
BlueBlood was amazing and their service was top notch. We had our first anniversary dinner here and the experience made it the most memorable 1st wedding anniversary,4
"Everything was great up until we asked the waitress if they could call a cab for us. The waitress then told us they had called us a cab. When we went to the front desk we asked them where do we get the cab, they never called us a cab and when they did they said it would be at the entrance to the restaurant. Well it was at the front entrance to the building, when we approached the cab the driver told us it for Anna. Fast forward the woman who called used her name not ours. If anyone goes there by cab  d needs a cab to return- call your own cab. You would think the money we spent over $600 they would know the process on how to call a taxi for a patron. I guess not. It put a bad taste in our mouths after a great meal.",3
"Fabulous! First time here, visiting from California. We loved everything about this place. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è all the way!",4
"Amazing decor and great service !
The seafood tower was a little disappointing for the price. Wagyu burger and salmon were over cooked. Desserts profiteroles and cr√®me br√ªl√©e very good !",3
Fantastic! Definitely recommended for birthdays or special events. Food was wonderful and service was spectacular.,4
We went for dinner before the Legends of Horror. The Caesar salad was the best we ever had. Loved the live show making it in front of us as well. Will definitely go back. Thank you for a beautiful experience.,4
"Once again
Always amazing and perfect
Always happy to visit Blueblood",4
"Great food, great service, great atmosphere. Will be back again.",4
We had a fantastic time! The food the service the attention to detail was amazing! Highly recommend the dining pod!,4
"Was told that they were not taking ‚Äúwalk-ins‚Äù so found a table on open table. When we arrived half the restaurant was empty. With an entire room of booths, they seated us at the only table in the room, next to a door and the register.  Servers were constantly at my husbands back ringing in items.  The food was excellent, but there was a larger party in the room next door that very loud and boisterous.  We asked some
Simple questions that never got answered.  People would stop by and say, ‚Äúdo you have everything?‚Äù Then would leave before we could answer.  I almost felt like we were being filmed for a prank show.",2
Amazing night. Perfect weather to be out on the terrace. Salad and dessert prepared at our table was super.,4
"Food was great, specially loved the grilled octopus, carpaccio and the lobster Mac.
But they actually took our plates without asking hehe and my daughter wasn‚Äôt done yet. So she was a little bit sad about that cause she wanted to finish her food. They also said that we get a little gift for a birthday but at the end of the meal they realized they ran out so they said to just come back (I think this could have been handled differently maybe give a slice of cake instead etc) I mean it‚Äôs not the cheapest place (we did spend over 500 easily for just 2 adults and 2 kids) and what‚Äôs a little piece of cake to make everything perfect right? Hehe.
Overall it was still good but could have been better (specially for the premium that you pay for).
Thanks!",3
"Truly exceptional food and a really fun venue. We kept saying dishes were the best version of them we‚Äôd ever had. The Caesar salad is not to be missed. The gravlax app was delicious. The duck fat French fries are outstanding; more like potato steaks really. Excellent steak, of course. My only criticism was that the service felt a bit rushed. We were in and out in about 75 minutes.",4
Great food and service in a weary unique setting.,4
Amazing fine dining experience. Would highly recommend for special occasions.,4
"Food & service was exceptional! The only thing that I didn‚Äôt like was the bar was extremely noisy, I would definitely go back and sit in a different part of the restaurant. Thank you Gabby for making our evening so special ‚ú®",4
"My most recent supper at BlueBlood Steakhouse at Casa Loma was a wonderful experience.  

The service, from being greatest in reception, to our server, the bus staff and somalier, were efficient and professional.  

The quality of the starters and mains was excellent.

An overall satisfying experience.",4
Beautiful setting with attention to detail from the servers and with the food! Amazing dining experience!,4
"Terrific food, drinks, and service in a unique, gorgeous space.",4
"Unbelievable from the moment you walk through the door to the beautiful ambience of the castle 
The food and service was second to none 
My new fave place to dine!",4
Beautiful setting with great food and service!,4
"Amazing
I love the service and the food
The best place i. The city",4
Stellar experience. Thoroughly enjoyed our evening and meal. Service was impeccable. We will be back.,4
Hay mesas y sillas que no van de acuerdo con la ‚Äúpersonalidad‚Äù del lugar,4
"Service was wonderful, but the menu is extremely overpriced and overall the food was just average.  I can't recall ever seeing wines marked up 300% and more in some cases.  The grilled octopus app was good, but not great.  The short rib ravioli was fantastic, except that is was covered in peas, which is not mentioned in the menu description.  Our ribeye was ordered MR, and about 80% of it was MR, but the ends were MW and inedible.  The baked potato was just a normal baked potato, not exactly sure how it was worth 20 CAD....  Overall, not worth the visit.",2
"Not only was the food delicious, the service 5-star and the d√©cor unique, the team went out of their way to accommodate us.",4
"Server Gio made my experience memorable. Went here for my birthday and was honestly an unforgettable experience. Our server Gio recommended the most amazing drinks, food, and a little tour. Drinks were 10/10 and food was just wow!! Thank you blueblood we will definitely be back!",4
"Absolutely amazing Food and Fantastic service ! Thank you Felix, Alex and Moe. For making our night unforgettable. From the bar (Felix) to the waiter (Alex) and master table side server Moe we couldn‚Äôt ask for better service. True gentleman with the customers needs out first. 

Must try if you‚Äôre in Toronto.",4
Celebrated my wife's 50th Bday. Wonderful evening with excellent food. Highly recommend.,4
"We had a great time celebrating our anniversary - our server Sue was awesome, friendly, attentive and answered our questions. We even got an anniversary gift (bottle stopper) ! The ambiance and dining pod were very romantic and a cool feature.",4
"The food was amazing and you get a great portion as well. Our waiter was friendly and engaging, we definitely will go again!",4
"Great food, service and ambiance. Had cr√®me caramel and coconut cream pie for dessert. Both were amazing!",4
"Food: The table-side Caesar salad was exceptional. Highly recommended. However, the salmon and potato salad needs so much more seasoning. They do provide extra salt to add to your food but it certainly doesn‚Äôt taste the same added on top of served food. Perhaps, it‚Äôs not always like that but this was just my experience. You must order a starter.

Service: No complaints. Everyone is kind and provides exceptional service. I do hope everyone gets a vote of confidence from time to time to continue doing as good as they do.

Atmosphere: Beautiful scenery. I couldn‚Äôt ask for better. Seating can happen in three settings: the pods, indoor, and patio (outdoor). Reservation is a must.

Parking: Not free. Valet or self-park costs $15 (card only). Parking is ample and safe.",3
"All courses were excellent and very generous in size. Not big on Steak so we had the Shrimp, Scallops and Cornish Hen and would highly recommend. Casa Loma location is amazing with great views off the patio",4
Such a beautiful place! One of a kind! Makes you feel like a royal member.,4
"We usually dine at BlueBlood for special occasions. My family and I absolutely love the dinning room, it's a beautiful room. The food is outstanding. We were a little disappointed that there was no coffee as the machine was broken. However, we understand these things happen...",4
Server and bartender were amazing. We sat in the pods and it was magnificent,4
"Dining at Blue Blood was an experience like none other.  We were celebrating a special day and felt just that - Special.  
Thank-you",4
"Dax as always a fantastic server.
Caesar salad is best in the City
yum!",4
best steak in Toronto  regular guest   always awesome,4
"This was my second visit to the Bloodblood Steakhouse. The Caesar Salad did not disappoint, although I must say the lettuce was not as crisp as the time before. In terms of the main course, my bone-in rib eye steak came out completely raw in the centre (I had ordered medium rare). It was more so rare than medium rare to be honest. Our waiter immediately offered to take the steak back to the kitchen where it was done to perfection.",3
"Unique experience, great vibe - definitely worth it",4
"We had a fantastic time! Our server, Gabby, was absolutely awesome, providing us with outstanding service. The food, the cozy atmosphere, and everything about the place was just  beautiful!",4
My partner and I had an amazing time. The food was spectacular and our server Tiffany made sure to make us feel special. Greatest customer service I‚Äôve had in a long long time. I would def come back.,4
Great atmosphere for celebration or anniversaries. Besides the atmosphere the foods were very delicious,4
Amazing it was a great and wonderful experience! Definitely recommend again,4
We enjoyed our 20th Anniversary dinner. Thank you for making it special.,4
"Beautiful place to Dine, Great attentive service!
Was my husband's birthday and they brought a lovely small gift and card to the table.
Would recommend for a special occasion.",4
Fantastic food and service! This restaurant is in a castle so amazing location for an event,4
Amazing steak. Cooked perfectly.  The staff was great. Always kept our glasses full.,4
Sergio is a great server ! Request him in the dining room ! And see you guys soon.,4
"The food here is delicious, well prepared and absolutely worth it. The cocktails were creative and tasty as well. Our server, Tiffany, was so patient with us. She thoroughly explained the menus and provided great recommendations. She made the experience one to remember. We cannot wait to visit again.",4
"BlueBlood Steakhouse is an unparalleled culinary gem. From the regal atmosphere to the impeccable steaks, it's a must-visit for any food enthusiast. Top-notch in every way!",4
"BlueBlood Steakhouse is an excellent place to have an incredible meal and good time!  Located in Casa Loma, the dining rooms are unique and create an amazing ambiance!

We had our Anniversary Dinner here for the first time and we enjoyed every minute!  The Caesar Salad was incredible and the steak was just perfect.  All complimented with a cordial staff that took care of our every need!

We definitely will be making another visit soon!",4
"Steak was cooked to perfection!
We had the private pod tables and it was a very unique experience. Wife loved em!",4
Loved the experience! Will definitely be going again!,4
"Fabulous dinner with friends visiting who had never had the benefit of seeing Casa Loma let alone dining there.

Every interaction with staff was friendly and our attendant Alex was exceptional. Knowledgeable, patient and funny he definitely added to our experience.

The food was incredibly delicious! From the appetizers to the steak to the sea bass; the sides‚Ä¶ it was all top notch.

Look forward to visiting again soon.

Thank you!",4
Beautiful ambience and delicious food. The food selection was good.,4
Prices don‚Äôt match the food served. Well overpriced,2
Food portions were great. Quality of food was good. I particularly enjoyed the truffle potato gratin. Hope to be back soon!,4
We had a perfect evening overlooking the Toronto skyline. Our waitress was delightful‚Äî attentive but never pushy. A special evening for both of us.,4
Food and service was A+!!  Took my partner there for his birthday and enjoyed the private dining pods. I highly suggest the table side caesar,4
The food is great. The server is nice.,4
"We love this place and our server was lovely‚Ä¶ just a little disappointed that we had ask repeated the side plates, cutlery (for multiple courses) and a very chipped glass ended up in use (which I completely understand is just a mistake but it was really chipped and could have broken skin). 

I know we were a larger party, perhaps that was the issue, but just felt a little surprised- please note;,Connor is lovely‚Ä¶ just noting the minor issues lastnight perhaps assigned to other staff.",4
"Great ambiance and a great experience. 
Service was excellent.",4
The waiter was great and good explainer and the food was delicious,4
"I recently had the pleasure of dining at BlueBlood Steakhouse with my parents, and it was an unforgettable experience from start to finish.

The ambiance was warm and inviting, creating the perfect setting for a special family dinner. From the moment we walked in, the staff was incredibly welcoming and attentive, making us feel right at home.

We started our evening with a bottle of their exquisite wine selection, expertly recommended by our server. It perfectly complemented the meal that followed. The sommelier's knowledge and passion for wine truly shone through.

Now, onto the main event - the steaks. Each bite was a culinary delight, perfectly cooked to our individual preferences. The quality of the meat was outstanding, and the flavors were simply divine. The attention to detail in every aspect of the dish was evident, showcasing the chef's skill and dedication.

To top it all off, the side dishes were equally impressive. The roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes were the ideal accompaniments, enhancing the overall dining experience.

We ended our evening with a delectable dessert that left us all with satisfied smiles.

Overall, BlueBlood Steakhouse exceeded our expectations in every way. It's not just a meal; it's an experience. I highly recommend this establishment to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience. We'll definitely be returning for more exceptional evenings in the future!",4
"We had a wonderful time. Food and service was fantastic and after telling our server, Gio that we were out for an anniversary he made sure to make it extra special.",4
"It was an experience. From the host greeting to the service which was perfectly attentive. The food was focused on ingredient quality and portions were sufficient to be full. The wine list is spectacular, I‚Äôm always a fan of an establishment that has laurent Perrier rose by the glass.",4
"Go for the ambiance, not the food. Definitely on the pricy side but amazing in the evening when there is symphony in the garden.",2
Went to the steakhouse with my beautiful fianc√© and she had a fantastic time. Thanks!,4
"It was a wonderful experience
Service was top notch, the sun was blaring into our eyes through the windows which made some our party too hot. The restaurant was really busy. It needed to be a better temperature in the dining room.
The food was excellent , the cocktails were fantastic
The atmosphere was amazing with the symphony playing live outside. Overall it was an excellent experience and was a memorable milestone dinner",4
Food was delicious! Very friendly staff! Clean environment! We very much appreciated the staff describing and explaining the process behind each meal and drink. And what a surprise when they prepared a card for our friend we were celebrating. A beautiful and memorable experience!!,4
Always beautiful and delicious. Just too many bees outdoor ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,4
"Very nice place and staff, they surprised us with birthday gifts. Thanks a lot for amazing evening!",4
As per usual.  I brought my date for a lovely dinner date and it didn't disappoint. Once again everything was fabulous from the food to the experience. Thank you blue bloods once again for a wonderful evening .,4
Excellent steak and great service! The dry-aged steak is perfection.,4
Waitress was amazing!!!! Food was excellent we were celebrating our anniversary,4
"Food was amazing! Unique appetizers, Ceasar salad made from scratch tableside, excellent selection of steaks from around the world, many non beef options as well, finished with tasty desserts. All served by engaging, professional staff. Looking forward to returning!",4
"We had an amazing experience dinning in the outdoor dome. Food was incredible, our server Tiffany went above and beyond and the whole night was just so unique and amazing! Will definitely be back :)",4
"The food, service, service and atmosphere was fantastic.  The steak was too rare for my daughter.   The manager came around and asked why she‚Äôs not eating her steak?  Told her it‚Äôs too rare and told her we are celebrating her birthday.  She took the steak back to cook it a bit more and gave us 2 desserts to celebrate her birthday.  Really appreciated the amazing service!",4
Best restaurant I've ever gone to in Toronto! Would highly recommend if you want the most memorable night on the town ever.,4
Food is quite good but one if the guess was not happy because her steak was medium-rare than medium.,4
"Wonderful,  the place beautiful, the food delicious, the best apple pie",4
Great experience awesome service and a perfect steak dinner. Very nice staff and the interior and exterior of the restaurant looked amazing. Would recommend for anyone that‚Äôs on a date or special occasion.,4
"There are many choices on the menu and so far everything has been excellent.  We enjoyed the foie, chilled jumbo prawns, wagyu steaks and sea scallops.  All were perfectly prepared and presented.  We're still trying to figure out how they managed a perfect sear on the foie without it falling apart or melting!

Our Somm found us a wine that perfectly suited our tastes and paired perfectly with dinner.",4
"It‚Äôs a great experience. My girlfriend and I came here to celebrate our anniversary. The ambiance is very welcoming and charming. Amazing food and service. Our server Dax, was extremely knowledgeable and made great recommendations. Big shout out to Dax for making our night fabulous!",4
"Myself and 3 friends enjoyed a special evening at Blueblood before Sole in the City. It was an amazing experience, excellent service and good food.  We enjoyed the Seared jumbo scallops Nero risotto, seafood mountain and the Caprese salad.  Followed by delicious banana crepes prepared at our table.",4
"Ambience and a view like no other ...swanky and upscale. But that's where the oooh and ahhh ends!
Our server was upbeat but not super attune to our needs. It was our first time there - and celebrating my husband's 51st birthday - tell us your specials, your expertise - find out what your guests love .....we didn't even get offered fresh pepper for the steak or mashed potatoes. Disappointing. Bread appeared with the main meal ....unlike for the other guest tables around us. 
We drank wine, enjoyed the concert happening downstairs which was a treat - but overall we weren't wowed. My husband didn't enjoy his steak - but no one bothered to care or even ask - should have been apparent when he only ate a bite or two and wrapped the rest for our dog at home!
Will not be back.",2
"It‚Äôs not often that I take time to write a review for dinner but I‚Äôm the case of our dinner and BlueBlood I think it is more than well deserved!

The food was fantastic and we loved the dining room!

All of the staff we met were great - especially Gabriella !
I am sure you must know the fabulous service she provides but please let her know we really appreciated it and she made our night very enjoyable!!

Best regards ,
Kate and Steve Bast.",4
"I've been to many restaurants and food experiences in Toronto, some much fancier, but this is my number one pick.
Food was AMAZING, and I'm a foodie and picky person saying this. I mean, how can you even cook steak like that? ü§Ø
Service was just excellent! It was probably the only time I received such customer service in Canada.
The experience after the meal was so much joy and fun and made the night even better.

We had a fantastic night; thank you, BlueBlood!",4
"Nicholas was AMAZING! 
Great service throughout the night, with great communication.",4
The food is absolytely amazing and the service is second to none. Everytime we go our servers are phenomenal.,4
"The server Su was amazing, she made our dinner very special. Thank you",4
"Great service, excellent food, and a stunning place to dine ü•∞",4
"During a recent visit to see our daughter who is in graduate school in Toronto, we enjoyed a special anniversary dinner after touring Casa Loma together.  When making my reservation, I requested seating at a booth in the Oak Room and they were able to accommodate the request that evening.  The ambiance, attentive service and delicious food combined to make a very memorable experience, not to mention the surprise gift of a BlueBlood wine cork to commemorate our anniversary.",4
Excellent service and great food. Loved the view and would strongly recommend,4
We had a great evening.awsome food (fish burger stake seafood )Wine selcetion was alao very good.Service great.It was worth all the money we spent therw.Thanks.,4
Excellent but too large portions   Caesar salad perfect   Would suggest ling dinner with a walk to the terrace to break thinks up   Everything was perfect,4
"Loved the place, 100% i will go back. Food amazing",4
"7.5/10 experience. 

Place: Pretty castle but can‚Äôt explore much. No A/C in dining area, runs real warm. Door open and flies come in, gross. 

Food: Pricy but only ok tasting. Not worth it. But the wagyu tasting with different salts was a cool experience for sure, Japanese wagyu cannot be beat. 

Service: Bare minimum. Maybe he had a bad day. But overall the vibe was depressing. Waste of beautiful space. Greeted hbd at the end of the service, but wasn‚Äôt introduced at the beginning of service and no birthday dessert was given either (despite reservations confirming they would). We received a small cork cap and handwritten letter as a gift. Nice touch, but weird given the birthday was never mentioned to the server. So they knew the whole time but only acknowledged at the end. Weird. 

Overall: Nice to go there one time, but never again. You‚Äôd expect better experience in a place like this, but prepare yourself for disappointment.",2
"Went here for an anniversary dinner, food was great but the real show stopper of our night was our waitress, I cannot remember her name off the top of my head, but she had dark hair, fair skin and was serving us on the lower part patio, she was attentive very kinda and knew it was our anniversary and was going out of our way to make it a special night. Definitely one of the best waiters I‚Äôve ever had. My only gripe that night was that there was a wedding going on next door that was kind of loud which ruined the ambience somewhat.",4
Service was okay but not wow! Everything else perfect,3
Excellent food and service. Highly recommend. A+++,4
Great time. Great food and great service. Beautiful patio as well.,4
"Our server Terrence was so knowledgeable, helpful, and good-natured. He made our celebration special.",4
Loud setting inside Blue Blood due to seating layout. If you want a more quiet atmosphere sit outside on patio or in a dome. The domes are heated. Service was 5 star. The servers checked in to top up drnks check food satisfaction etc. The on staff Sommelier is fantastic.,3
"First time in Toronto and my 30th birthday. The ambiance is absolutely amazing, the castle setting is beautiful. The inside was just as elegant. We had the Waygu tasting which was phenomenal and then the Canadian filet which wasn‚Äôt as great (over cooked). For sides we did the Truffle Au Gratin which I could eat for every meal, corn nut creamed corn (superb), and the lobster Mac. For dessert we had the Baked Alaska which I‚Äôve never had so was fun to experience the production of it. Overall the service was good. I would say a bit overpriced (especially cocktails) but would come back again!",4
"Great service, ambiance and food.Cdn rib eye was not as tender as expected",4
"We went there for the first time on a date night. Our server was friendly and professional and the sommelier was very knowledgeable. The food was pretty good. Our steak was perfectly medium rare and the asparagus was delicious. The ambience was the best part, dining in a castle was definitely a great experience.",4
Service was very poor- was not able to get server to bring our bill toward end of night and we're frequently interrupted in our conversation.,3
"We wanted to choose a special restaurant to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and we can confidently say it was an outstanding experience from start to finish (I also have to mention that our server, Gabriella was amazing). Everything about this restaurant exceeded our expectations, making it a truly memorable visit.",4
"This was overall THE WORST dining experience I‚Äôve ever had the displeasure to endure. I don‚Äôt understand how the service can be this lackluster with such an expensive bill.

We ordered the beef tartare - 39$ - hilariously small portion, too many spices. Plating was interesting, it was served in a bone.

Wagyu filet tasting - 270$ - A plate with three small wagyu steaks on it. From right to left: australian, japanese, american.

The american fillet tasted very generic and honestly had no business being called wagyu. The australian fillet was decent and the japanese was pretty good. However, they weren‚Äôt cooked properly, the crust was only on one side of the steak.
No garnish or sauces, no spices. Plating was hilariously bad. I would‚Äôve been able to do a better job at plating the extremely expensive meat. They literally just slapped the 3 fillets on the plate and called it a day.

On to the service. We are smokers so we left our seats a couple times to go for a smoke. The server brought our appetizer while we weren‚Äôt sat at the table so we got no explanation for the dish. There was no explanation for the dishes, no description. At this price point I expect the server to bring the dish and explain it to me in detail. The wine menu is literally a tablet. I have never seen something this tasteless. I‚Äôm literally in a castle and the menu is a tablet.
At one point my water glass was empty for more than 20 minutes. 
Wine bottle was not at the table, it was instead decanted in a pitcher that a server periodically brought out to refill our glasses.
We are italians on vacation and this service would absolutely not fly in Italy, especially at this price.",0
"Enjoyed an amazing dinner out on the terrace. Great food, great service, great views!",4
"service was outstanding. 
food continues to shine
always magical to have that level of excellance and in a castle no less!!",4
I had a fantastic dinner experience on the terrace.. I highly recommend the table side Caesar salad the show itself is fun to watch. The cocktails are just delicious and go down way to fast. The service is outstanding providing a table side stand for your purse and a blanket for the chilly evening. Perfect Date Night !!!,4
Great service and great experience. Food was delicious and would recommend 10/10,4
"Excited to try this restaurant, always heard great things. The food was amazing, service was great and a beautiful place to enjoy dinner.",4
"Service is very nice. Everyone is very kind, specially waiter Gabby and a Filipino lady performing salad making.",4
Food looked amazing but tasted only ok. Service was great though. For my husband‚Äôs birthday they gave us a small chocolate and berry dessert  (which was perfect) and a Bluebloods wine topper.,2
"Overall a great place for fine dining! The only thing I‚Äôll say is that my bf and I aren‚Äôt big alcohol drinkers so we weren‚Äôt told that the dessert had rum in it üòÇ in the middle of it, there was chocolate ice cream and raspberry sorbet which was good! So just a heads up for anyone who isn‚Äôt a fan of rum! 

The medium rare steak we had was pretty good too! What‚Äôs interesting is that they give u three types of salts to try with your steak. Very neat! Service was great too. The waiters are very attentive. You‚Äôll be happy you made the choice to go here :)",3
"This was a terrible experience. First of all it was overly crowded which does not match to the stake house class I expected. The ventilation is poor to a point that we all sweated. We were seated close to a window and the sun really came down on me and baked me very uncomfortably. Not to mention the wagyu tasting package we ordered was a joke, we felt they were freezed somehow, really not worth the price.",0
"Great as always. 4th time here and the service is always great, along with the food. Prices as like everywhere else has been increased and the chimichurri sauce wasn't up to par this time around. Nonetheless, it's definitely one of my go to steak spots for a nice celebration meal besides Jacobs especially given the ambiance of Casaloma.",3
We celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary at Blue Blood and enjoyed the experience immensely. The food was beautifully presented with a high degree of attention. The service was excellent - very attentive. The executive chef Sean Blomeley is to be commended for the menu.,4
"It‚Äôs not the same food as it used to be, quality has gone down.
Service also used to be much better. Few dishes were forgotten about and but brought out and we were never compensated for it in a form of free dessert etc to make the customer happy.
The only thing holding it in place is the fact that it‚Äôs in casa loma and the view is breathtaking, that is all",1
"We had an incredible experience at this restaurant. The ravioli appetizer was truly exceptional, setting the tone for a delightful meal. The steaks exceeded all expectations and can easily be considered the finest in the city. The coconut dessert was a perfect ending to our dining experience. Not only does the place boast a stunning interior, but the terrace also offers an astonishing view that truly enhances the atmosphere.",4
"Lovely venue. I enjoyed my scallops. The steak eaters at the table thought it could've been seasoned better. The lobster mac was too hard, but such is life.",4
"The wait staff, especially Stewart, was phenomenal!  Made the whole experience better!",3
Enjoyed the Caesar salad made table side - ambiance was excellent- good food and service - expensive.,4
Family dinner celebrating a birthday.  Loved the dry-aged striploin steak!  Sea Bass was excellent and was a big portion. Baked Alaska dessert is totally worth it.,4
"Spectacular!!
A must visit on your bucket list of great restaurants 
We will be back üç∑",4
"Perfectly cooked steaks, delicious sauces (could  be slightly more flavourful to compliment tenderloin), excellent service lovely quiet pod... most enjoyable experience.",4
"Nice ambience and service but the food was awful for the price charged, both the Tatar and the chicken. So I didn't enjoy the food. Also there were many options for wine bottles but only for one for wine per glass.",2
"Sadly, food is just not very good, espcially the steaks. Extremely disappointing waste of money. Drinks are great though! Go for the (patio) view and the drinks.",1
The ambiance was great but food wasn‚Äôt so good. Steaks were overcooked and lacked flavour. The server was good but the food could have been better.,2
"This was another great meal.  The service was very nice, attentive but not intrusive. The servers were all very polite and knowledgeable.",4
"It was a nice restaurant, food was good, restaurant setting was nice. Didn‚Äôt like the bread but The wagyu was great.",3
We had an older person in our party and the walk to go to the bathroom was very difficult. Down a long staircase. He asked and was told that that was the only place. Very upsetting.,3
"Sommelier was excellent. Bartender‚Äôs martini preparation was also excellent. Wait staff was friendly and helpful. The only ‚Äúbump was coffee and dessert were ordered together, but arrived separately and only after coffee was ordered a second time. 
Food: no baked potato was available with our steak, and only 2 wee anchovies put in Caesar salad for 2 ~ only a problem if you like anchovies and asked for them. Otherwise, excellent. Ambiance is fabulous.",3
"We made a reservation for dinner in the pod /dome and it was the best decision. Gabriella was phenomenal with her service, the food was exceptional. I highly recommend.",4
Outstanding service and beautiful place! Food just excellent.,4
"What an unforgettable evening.  We were celebrating a 65th birthday for a princess so the setting was very appropriate.  The food, service and ambiance were amazing.  Jesse our server went above and beyond to ensure we had a great night.  
I highly recommend Blue Bloods.",4
Food and service with Connor all excellent. Brilliant venue,4
The service is extraordinary and the ambiance is classy and elegant.,4
Had a perfect birthday dinner. I will definitely be back ‚ù§Ô∏è,4
Perfect romantic atmosphere with a feeling in palace,4
"Personal preference - not nearly what I expected... a shame considering the venue, Don Alfonso should occupy this space instead...",1
"Took my young daughter‚Äôs to dinner in the castle and they were treated like princesses. We split the porterhouse from Alberta and it was one of the best steaks I have ever had. Foie Gras was amazing. Octopus was delicious. Highly recommend the lobster Mac n‚Äô Cheese.

Truly an experience we will remember forever.",4
"The food was very underwhelming. The steaks were tough and not the quality we were expecting for the $80-120 price. The steak knives were so dull that it made it even harder to cut the tough steak. It was so tough to chew, was not cooked evenly, with spots of blue-medium rare-medium well at different points of the steak. That was consistent with 3 steaks we had as part of our group.

The salad was underwhelming and nothing special AT ALL. It could easily be prepared at home. The tuna tartare was alright but the avocados were brown.

Service was slow and inattentive for a high-end restaurant. There were many teens as servers and the service was super slow, waited 30-40 minutes to place our order after we were seated and couldn‚Äôt even flag down our server. He was extremely nice, however, slow and personally it felt very inattentive. I‚Äôd much rather spend the same amount of money (which was a pretty hefty bill) at Morton‚Äôs steakhouse or anywhere else.

The interior is very underwhelming as well. The noise is pretty loud and it‚Äôs a bunch of servers and teens that are running around, seemingly very disorganized and chaotic. There‚Äôs banging and rustling of salad carts constantly and a bunch of casa loma workers just running in and out (apart of casa loma in itself), not actual Blueblood employees that disrupts the ambience and flow of the restaurant.

I was personally very excited to dine in Casa Loma but I was extremely disappointed at the food, service and ambience of the restaurant.",1
"Tolles Ambiente, gutes Essen, gro√üe Portionen, perfekter Service, herrliche Cocktails
Caesar salad for 2 live angerichtet und k√∂stlich",4
It was a perfect night from start to finish! The patio is stunning and the service is impeccable.,4
very unprofessional staff. only friendly just to get a tip.,0
"It was a beautiful location and the servers were very friendly. All the food was fantastic. It was expensive, but that was to be expected. Although the service was friendly it was very slow.",3
"Great service and delicious food.  Our Server was amazing. Will definitely come back.  By the way, I left my receipt on the table is there a way that I can get a copy of that receipt.  Thank you in advance",4
"Our serve Jesse was the best, food was absolutely delicious we had a great evening",4
It was everything I thought it would be! Beautiful atmosphere with the Symphony playing in the background. Spectacular food and even more spectacular service!,4
We loved the food service and concert. I cannot recommend this experience highly enough.,4
"The break up of a main main dish into extra purchase for sides is beyond absurd (it‚Äôs called price gouging- it‚Äôs not doing things differently) 

Learn to stop feeding the inflation problem and learn to be human. 

I would never eat here again based on the exploitive nature of the menu and continual diversion of class (yeah blame ignorance) . Just because I can afford it doesn‚Äôt make it ok. Shameful honestly. 

More shameful that they turned a historic building into a restaurant. My shame is having spent money here. I apologize",2
Had dinner in the private pods and really enjoyed the ambience. Great food and service. Waitress was very helpful with recommendations and attentive. Food portions were perfect. Would highly recommend!,4
Wonderful experience with my twin daughters. Had dinner to celebrate an engagement. Amazing service and the food was indescribably amazing.,4
"Standing service, food quality, ambience.Best steak and service in the city. Seafood tower was abundant, fresh, table side caesar was made to perfection. And olive-fed steak melt in your mouth. Service extraordinaire. Never disappoints.:",3
Great Experience. My Husband took me there for My birthday. It was so special.,4
Very good but pricey - great view of the city from the terrace,3
Great food and fantastic service will be returning,4
BlueBlood Steakhouse is what I imagine a restaurant in heaven would be like,4
I went to BlueBlood Steakhouse again just 3 weeks after my first visit because I just couldn‚Äôt resist it! I requested the server Alex (from Hungary) because he made our first visit so wonderful! I tried the Caesar salad that‚Äôs made table side and it was the best I‚Äôve ever had!! For the main course I stuck with the bone in rib-eye because it‚Äôs just too good! Sweet potato fries are a must as well! There are so many other menu items I‚Äôm looking forward to trying !! I want all the desserts ‚ò∫Ô∏è. This time we were in the bar room and it is just gorgeous! This has to be the most beautiful restaurant in Toronto! 12/10!,4
Amazing food and great views! Sit outside if you can it is gorgeous,4
Fantastic dining experience. Excellent service and food.,4
"Took the tour of Casa Loma., booked on open table half hour before our seating. The outdoor dining was the best seat in the house. It was sunny and clear, perfect view of the CN tower. We had the Caesar salad for 2 table side., a bit of a show. the seafood and a Chardonnay.Perfect. But be ready to spend a bit more. Overall the experience was phenomenal.",4
Wonderful food and service. Only initial problem on the terrace was considerable noise from the wedding adjacent to the terrace.,4
"It was my first time dining at BlueBlood and I can say it was an amazing experience everything was perfect the food the staff , thank you for making our evening great",4
Waiter suggested an alternative item that incorporated all the items I couldn‚Äôt make my mind up on.,4
"Poor service
Sub Par Food
Nothing special
Exorbitant Prices
Staff looked tired and frustrated
Did I say food was really sub Par?",0
"Wonderful service, great menu/food, beautiful dining room, everything was just perfect.",4
"We attended to see the Symphony and started with dinner. The service and food were excellent the only thing is it was very warm in the restaurant. I found it hard to concentrate at the end of the meal on anything other than how warm I was. 

Other than that I would not have changed a thing and I will return",4
We had a wonderful dinner for our anniversary.  Modern steakhouse menu at a classic steakhouse setting.,4
"This was the most pleasant dining experience I‚Äôve had in a while. The service was fantastic and the food amazing! I‚Äôm now recommending this place to all my friends who are looking for a nice dining experience when celebrating. 
It is pricey and not something I would be able to do all the time, but I‚Äôm planning to go again. 
Kudos for the staff. Service was the best I‚Äôve seen so far in Toronto.",4
"It was very nice, definitely next level. It‚Äôs very pricey but the food quality is excellent and the service is outstanding. They clean your table in between each course and bring you new flatware and cloth napkins.  It was raining when we left so somebody walked us to our car with an umbrella. The restaurant is in a castle and you‚Äôre definitely treated like royalty. The food was delicious as well as the cocktails (not watered down). I ordered the ravioli appetizer and it was so good! The gratin is such a delicious side dish and i recommend trying it. I got the waygu filet mignon with the mushroom sauce and it was also great.",4
"Steaks under cooked. Did not want to send the back wall or sides, then became cold. Server disappeared for long periods of time could not find him. Lobster was undercooked as well.",2
Absolutely superb dining experience. Moza was a wonderful waiter and made the experience magnificent!,4
"Steaks were not flavourful or cooked as we requested. When sent back my steak came soaked in so much jus the plate looked like soup. Their Japanese wagu cuts look and taste like a piece of a striploin steak.

Staff come to the table much too often. Every few minutes interrupting to ask if everything was fine. It prevented any relaxation.

Staff cleared plates before we finished, or even asked if my wife was done while still eating, go figure. They left food bits on the table. Spilled on the table and didn‚Äôt clean but chose to cover it with my plate. Any item brought to the table was left at the edge instead of placing it in front of us. Why bring me my espresso at leave it at the other end of the table.
E

I might be nitpicking but all these little things added up on top of a $125 steak that wasn‚Äôt cooked properly, twice, as requested and didn‚Äôt taste like anything special. The Keg would have been better and much cheaper.
Harbor60 is in the same price range and solid 100% of the time. Barbarians is a good alternative but not the same ambiance.   Dessert  was lack lustre and also not made as requested.",1
Gabby and Omar were wondering!,4
"This was a 10/10 steak house experience. The service was top tier, the food was remarkable, the ambience and visual ties it all to complete a perfect experience.",4
"The gravlax was outstanding. The Caesar salad was superb  We made the mistake of ordering too vegetables.  The main courses were lovely.  But no room for dessert.
sommelier was great and the wine choice was delicious     Yes it was a little too noisy. Maybe next time we will sit in one of the side rooms or even outside   The main dining room as you would say, was very lively  Ôøº",4
Met all our expectations for a special dining experience. The castle provided a wonderful setting and our waiter ( Gio) was most helpful and attentive. Don't miss the Caesar salad!,4
"Honestly they would have gotten a 5 star all around from food was great service was as well only thing was the guy up charged us on our bill, and due to the environment you don‚Äôt want to be the only guy arguing about the difference in size of a shot but that difference was 180$",4
Terrance was amazing an 11/10 - only issue was the dining room was too hot - need more a/c or ventilation. Otherwise a perfect evening. Thanks for the memorable experience.,4
The view was amazing as expected! Beautiful ambience. Tiffany our server and the bartender was absolutely fantastic and made perfect recommendations for everything we asked. Would highly recommend this experience to anyone looking for a beautiful evening in the city.,4
Great fancy dinner spot. There was great service but well on the pricey side,4
It was our 28 year anniversary and we have never been to Casa Loma before. I found the restaurant on Instagram and loved and atmosphere pro-trade in customers pictures. It did not disappoint. We began sitting at the bar and enjoying a cocktail. Then we sat down for dinner. The whole evening was wonderful. The food/drinks a little pricey if I have to comment on but still a very good night. I would definitely go again.,4
"Excelente atenci√≥n
Muy buen sabor de cada uno de los platillos
Porciones grandes",4
Shawn is so nice! And the service was really great ü•∞,4
"great food, great venue- a special treat for a special occassion.",3
"Omg! This was one of the best dining experiences I‚Äôve ever had! The dining room is so beautiful, the food was amazing!! Best part though; the service!!! I highly recommend!!",4
The seafood tower was described as an appetizer - it's really a meal.  Was hard to eat a steak afterward.  Otherwise spectacular comfortable and upscale.,4
"Had a great dinner at BlueBlood for our anniversary and it was very enjoyable.  Service was very good, not exceptional, but when compared to other super high end restaurants, it disappointed slightly.  Also no air conditioning in the restaurant (it's an old castle so not surprising I guess) and we went on a very hot day, so the temperature was uncomfortably warm, especially when dressed for a nice dinner.  The food was very very good, but again not exceptional, especially considering the price.  Honestly, everything was very good but we've had better meals at other high end steak houses, for substantially less money.  The building and grounds are stunning and makes a stop at BlueBloods a necessary experience when in Toronto.",3
"We had a wonderful meal at BlueBloods Steakhouse. Steaks cooked to perfection, and our waiter was amazing!",4
"The ambience of Blue Blood Steakhouse was most stately and old world elegant.
Our waiter Sean was most attentive and very pleasant!
The  food was wonderful from our salads to dessert!
It was definitely a high light of our trip to Toronto!",4
"Best birthday experience- dinner and symphony.
Thank you for sealing me well.",4
"The food was phenomenal. The service was not. It felt like our server was ignoring us a lot, and other members of staff would walk by with looks of sympathy at our empty glasses and empty plates (waiting for the next course). And at the end we waited so long for our final check that we were late for the symphony which was apart of the VIP package we purchased for the steakhouse. But every other member of staff we encountered was gracious, pleasant, and welcoming.",3
"Very poor serving of the Seafood Tower.
80 dolars/ person should have more quantity of seafood per person. Nevertheless the quality was really great, but the amount of seafood is ridiculous for the price",2
"Great experience overall! The food was delicious, the service was exquisite and the view from the patio was beautiful. I would definitely recommend!",4
"Outstanding food. Particularly enjoyed seared fois gras, short rib ravioli with mushroom jus, truffle potatoe gratin, wagyu steak trio and scallops. Server Gio was attentive and professional. Not overbearing. Table-side Caesar server excellent as well.

They allowed to walk around and take pictures between courses. Wedding had some noise, but we didn‚Äôt mind.

Only ‚Äúbeef‚Äù is that the front young ladies (greeters? Reservations people ?) had a bit of attitude and not as friendly as I expected. They also took little interest in basic questions about Castle Loma. Seemed ‚Äúsnobby‚Äù for lack of better description. Took my umbrella on check in, and didn‚Äôt offer it back on exit. Fake smiles. Very much in contrast to Gio and other servers who were outstanding!

Easy Uber drop off/pick up location.",3
"Service was good and attentive. Our server was very sweet and tried her best. The cheese bread was nothing to write home about, the parsnip strips were very tasty. The Ceasars salad for 2 was made table side and was traditional and beautifully made. It was oddly the highlight of the meal. Just to be clear the steaks were.perfectly cooked , although I found mine a tad cold and the quality is as advertised.  And that is where the issue is. For over 100 bucks a steak it's just plainly overpriced. The dessert was forgettable and iced ice cream not palatable. They took care of the dessert which was appropriate and at the end you pay 400 bucks for a salad and a steak with the tips and taxes. I realize the the post Covid Era has priced a $50 steak 3 years ago now at $100+, it's just hard to justify , at least for me. Our meal at a 3 star Michelin restaurant in Paris last year was just about double the price. But the experience, the multiple courses, quality, price comparison was way more than double from blue bloods which is just a good steakhouse.  
I guess it's just difficult nowadays to put value in these extraordinary prices. Taking prices out of the equation, it's a good restaurant with good service and nice ambiance.",2
"We are repeat customers, the food is great and we love it here!",4
Such a lovely dining experience! We got there very late but they still accommodated us right before 11pm. John and Jessie were fantastic servers and everyone was lovely. Can‚Äôt wait to return to spend more time at this historic building,4
"The venue itself is beautiful and grand. The service at BlueBlood was great. Our server was kind and attentive. She was warm and welcoming, also wished us a Happy Anniversary right when we sat down. However, the food was a hit and miss. I had the Pink Drink cocktail and it was wonderful. The Waghu rib eye steak with the rock salts and cesar salad were good. However, the crab fritters were very disappointing and truffle potato gratin was just ok. The crab fritters were so doughy and there was barely any crab flavor. Th chumichurri sauce was underwhelming. We didn‚Äôt get wowed by the ambiance because we were seated in the small area by the entrance and tucked away in the corner. That‚Äôs too bad because the rest of the dining areas looked beautiful. I‚Äôd suggest making a note during your reservation to request seating in a specific area or asking to change tables if you‚Äôre seated in this room. At the end of the meal, we were gifted with a custom BlueBlood/Casa Loma wine bottle cork with a Happy Anniversary note. That was a nice gesture.",1
"Food was ok, what better other time.
We sat outside and were was a wedding going on, we got seated right next to it when there was so many other open spots so it was very load. Unfortunately we were allowed to look through the castle when all the other times we were allowed.",2
Everything was good other than the prices are much over rated than other same stars steakhouse in Toronto. To go and to be just inside a part of the Casa Loma I might recommend but other than that I won't.,2
"Absolutely amazing experience! Food was amazing, staff incredibly accommodating and nice and Alex was such a professional we felt very well taken care of!",4
Service was even better than the food and the food was amazing.  Enjoyed the sirloin but the lobster mac and cheese was decadent!  Had the Apple pie dessert and it was beautifully presented and tasted even better than it looked.  Our first visit to this incredible steakhouse but certainly not our last,4
Had a wonderful dinner for seven.  Originally booked outdoors but because of the summer fires we were moved indoors.   Very attentive service and great steak and appetizer and side dish recommendations done.  porterhouse and tomahawk and two different wagyu dishes were excellent.  Would highly recommend for steak in toronto and would return.  Great venue in Casa Loma.,4
"Food was fantastic, service and the attention to detail was excellent. Couldn't of picked a better restaurant for our anniversary dinner. Great Staff - Thank you!!",4
"Love love love. Our server was so sweet, our food was great. Casa Loma is lovely‚Ä¶ blueblood decorate is lively!",4
"We booked a table in the Terrace. It was a lovely spot with a wonderful breeze. Food, wine and service was amazing.",4
"Excelente lugar!!!
Es el restaurante perfecto para una velada inolvidable",4
We had an excellent experience for our first visit to Blue Bloods. Our server was fantastic. Steak was perfect. Amongst the best atmosphere we have had for a steakhouse in Toronto. We found the value to be quite good and will return again.,4
"Everything was good , just was disappointed with my request with flowers that they havent put which was so wrong as a big restaurant. Othwr than that food was good.",3
"I met my love in this place 200 days ago, and it‚Äôs her birthday. it‚Äôs our celebration dinner and has special meaning to us, wonderful experience.",4
"I like this restaurant I was so happy there, everything is good and you make special night anniversary for me. Thanks a lot .I recommend this place ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•",4
serge was a terrific and knowledgable waiter but a very pleasant personality. Food was as always superb,4
"Foods are nice and friendly servers. 
Great environment for having meals.",4
"Delicious wagyu steak, appetisers. Extremely happy about overall experience.",4
"I put a note for champagne to start, but nothing was presented.
We were seated beside loud speakers, we couldn't here each other talk or the waitresses. We had to wait until the music stopped in order to talk.
Lowering the volume on those speakers were not an option. Otherwise food and service was perfect!",1
Was a good meal in a nice atmosphere..................,3
"Our server was very respectful gentleman and he did great job even he just  gave us short tour of the other room with summery of history. It was such a wonderful time for me and my daughters on her birthday dinner. Sorry I forgot the name of that gentleman.
Thank you Blue Blood steak house",4
"Attentive staff and great atmosphere; truffle potato gratin was delicious; disappointed with the crab fritters as it didn‚Äôt seem there was much, if any, crab - it was primarily breading",3
Amazing experience! I loved! Everything was perfect!,4
Great experience all good. Definitely recommend it,4
"Steak was excellent, truffle gratin and grilled mushrooms generously sauced.",1
Grabbed some apps and drinks.  Great food in a castle! Can‚Äôt ask for better.,4
"Fantastic night, staff were very friendly and professional",4
Unbelievable‚Ä¶the only word we used as we were walking out,4
"Great place.
Love the food, love the vibes, love the service.
For such a high-class restaurant, the timing of the food and drinks servings should be better. For example: Cocktail drinks were served late, after appetizers were already served.
But as mentioned, great place to dine.",3
"Everything was absolutely fantastic except I got the slowest server on the floor. Very aloof and not very cognizant of the table environment or the customers needs. It was just him because every other server was on top of everything 

When we had after dinnee drinks at the bar, the bartenders were amazing from drinks made to conversation and customer service

It is a great place overall but just a one off on the server",4
I expected the quality of the steak to be higher but overall experience was beautiful. Perfect place for a special dinner.,3
"Beautiful dining space, we loved the intimacy of our individual sofa seats near the window, and the perfect ambient lighting. Our server was very kind and genuinely invested in our experience, and we had no issues with our service itself. 

Unfortunately, myself and my partner both did not enjoy our entr√©es very much. I got the salmon (medium) and broccolini. I found the salmon to be very bland, and slightly undercooked at the centre for my taste. The real issue was a lack of flavour though. Unfortunately same went for the broccolini, which although was perfectly cooked, was topped with an underwhelming mornay sauce. My partner had an American prime bone-in rib eye, and found it to be also not cooked enough to his liking (medium) and unfortunately not as flavourful as he is used to. Please note we did not request additional cook time or any amendments while at dinner, which can be faulted to us. 

We do however absolutely recommend the duck fat french fries, and the crab fritter entree, as although they were fried, they were full of flavour and delicious with every bite. Overall, this was a stunning place to dine and we had a great time. All of the staff were amazing, professional, and made the experience feel special and worth the cost (more than the food).",4
"Grilled octopus was very tender and tasty. Steaks were average at best, my wagyu was ice cold (still not sure how they managed this as it was cooked medium rare as I asked for) and asked our waiter to get it warmed up. Wine selection by the glass is limited however cocktail selection is huge. 
Overall a nice place to dine but not worth the $$$.",3
Excellent staff and service. Portions were pretty large. Over all quality of taste of food was pretty lacking. I‚Äôve had all these dishes other places with better flavour,1
Important client dinner. We were treated like royalty. They were so good. Was amazing! Thanks so much!!,4
Excellent!  Decided to bring friends again next month. Jacob our server was great,4
Always Awesome,4
"Everything was amazing.   Lots of little extra touches.
Other than price, which you can see the prices on line, this place was a wonderful experience.
Our waiter was fun and helpful.  All the food was excellent.  Handy tip‚Ä¶.the sides are enough for 2 people, so don‚Äôt order 2 starches.  Same for the dessert.
The tables are quite far apart so it‚Äôs not noisy at all.  There are heaters all over the place if needed.  Quite a few tourists ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. so good for people watching.",4
"Amazing experience, from the greeting in the parking lot, to the hostess, to our wonderful waiter. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was wonderful.",4
"We went to celebrate our daughter‚Äôs graduation from university. BlueBloods never disappoints; it was our kids first time. From the octopus to the table side Cesar salad, to the tomahawk steak and scallops - we couldn‚Äôt ask for a better family dinner. The service was phenomenal thanks to Dino, who was funny, friendly and very generous with their suggestions for drinks and food. We can‚Äôt wait to go back soon, my husband and I go at least 4 times a year.",4
Love everything about this place ü•∞ the food was amazing I could taste the seasoning üò¨ big up to the chefü•∞,4
"Clean place 
Food quality was good
Extra $2.00 charge for bread- made the restaurant feel greedy and cheap 
Service was fast 
Our server was amazing, kind and soft spoken 
Overall good experience",3
The terrace is a beautiful experience! Highly recommend a warm summer night out there.,3
Service and food was amazing. Will definiately go back.,4
Beautiful venue and the food was great. Definitely a worthwhile restaurant if visiting Toronto.,4
"Beautiful setting with attentive staff.  Prices are on the high side, but atmosphere, portions and quality make it worth the experience.",3
Great server made the experience that much greater thank you,4
"The service is impeccable. Food was excellent but it is definitely a splurge. The accompaniments are best shared, so go with a friend.",4
"We had a lovely time celebrating a birthday on the terrace.
Highly recommend dining here when visiting Toronto.
Truly an evening to remember.",4
"Food quality is not as good as you expect and definitely overpriced, specially if we compare it to a couple of the Michelin restaurants in Toronto. That said, it's a beautiful restaurabt and the service we received was outstanding. I recommende it for those who don't mind the high cost.",4
"food is very fresh and hearty, in a beautiful castle with ambient lighting!",4
The attention to detail was great! Our server Alex was exceptional!,4
"It‚Äôs a great experience. The ambiance is very welcoming and charming. Amazing wines, food and service. Staff are extremely knowledgeable and make great recommendations.",4
"Beautiful location, awesome ambience, service was impeccable. One of the best restaurants I have experienced. Food was extraordinary. Beautiful view of the city.",4
"We had a business meeting celebration! The food, service and the experience was extraordinary! Gio was an amazing server!",4
"An anniversary meal served well, but the food didn't match the place nor the price. Our server was wonderful and it was nice to receive a small gift for our anniversary; however, the $75 steak tasted and chewed like a backyard BBQ steak. Oh, and $20 for 4 tomato slices is crazy.
As for the atmosphere, the Casa Loma was beautiful inside and out, but the restaurant was very loud as some of the patrons were very vocal.",2
"Blue Bloods is pricey, but you get excellent food and service, and it's well worth the experience!",4
"Excellent experience. We sat on the terrace, the view was amazing and our waiter Marcus was fantastic. We would definitely come back.",4
"my partner and i‚Äôd experience at blueblood was exceptional! From the smooth, check-in to the service Blueblood really aims to cater to their guests in the highest of qualities. I personally enjoyed the seared scallops with risotto (tender/well cooked/a little too chewy for my personal liking, flavourful in every bite), broccolini (perfect softness and crunch with their signature sauce was amazing), And lobster mac & cheese (was thick and creamy! absolutely delicious and lobster was tender and not too chewy as well). 
The noise level was a bit too high for my partner and I to not be able to hear each other. 
The ambience was rather stunning and opulent! I always fall in love with the architecture here everytime so that was another highlight of my night. 
Service was great and i‚Äôd definitely come here again!",4
"The best service I‚Äôve ever experienced in a Toronto restaurant. From the greeting at the door to the bartenders to the sommelier to the server it was outstanding. Beautifully made cocktails, scrumptious appetizers and then a ribeye that I couldn‚Äôt even finish cause the whipped potatoes and creamed corn sides were soooo good. Others had scallops, burger and filet mignon and everyone was happy. It was my belated birthday so worth the splurge but I‚Äôd save up to go back again.",4
"First time at Blueblood but wow amazing service and food was perfect 

I will go again at my next trip to Toronto",4
"An amazing location with fabulous staff. The food was perfect, we had a great experience.",4
We drove 2 hours to celebrate our daughters birthday. From the time we pulled up until we left everything was perfect. If you‚Äôve never been I recommend you trying it at least once. Dinner in a castle. How can you go wrong?,4
Incredible experience! Food exceeded expectations. Can‚Äôt wait to come back.,4
"I always admire chefs who can create dishes with a unique taste. Although I enjoyed everything we had, I have to say the Marieville Foie Gras is exceptional. I also have a strong preference for their Gravlax. The service was good, and the decor was particularly captivating, reminiscent of a bygone era from a hundred years ago.
I would like to express my gratitude to Gio, who did an outstanding job in helping to create a perfect birthday dinner.",4
"Great food, great service and beautiful 16th century decor.",4
Service was not par to high end steakhouse also it was my wife's birthday  we did not expect anything like other high end resturant  would of offered  a dessert,2
Everything about our experience was five stars. From the time we walked in the door. Until we left our meal. We didn‚Äôt want for anything. It was all very well done. The food was excellent and at one point we even spilled a drink and it was immediately replaced without even having to ask. The manager came over picked up the glass And then just brought another drink. Everything was absolutely outstanding. Excellent staff. Excellent food.,4
"My favorite restaurant in Toronto,, I flew all way from Atlanta Georgia to visit it",4
"We had a very good dinner . The staff was very good and food was great .. the ambiance is always comfortable. 
 We would recommend Blue Bloods to anyone .",4
"We had an amazing time, thank you to the whole team for a very memorable evening! Fabulous food and service!",4
Amazing!! Amazing food and the most impeccable service ever!! Can‚Äôt say enough about this place,4
"Service was impeccable, view was stunning, overall ambiance was lovely. Food was great too!",4
"Beautiful spot as always, a little loud on Mother‚Äôs Day but overall lovely. Thanks!",3
Incredible experience! Can‚Äôt wait to go back and we love the Parlour Room,4
Service and venue was unparalleled. The food however was far from delicious at the price in which you pay.,2
"Lovely room, smaller and more intimate space, lovely comfortable chairs and banquets.",4
The food was good but not great. The castle location helped elevate the whole experience,3
Amazing experience. Amazing food and amazing service!,4
Truly our experience was made by Terence you are very lucky to have him. He is wonderful,4
"Awesome food, environment & service! 10/10 overall experience, well done!",4
I had an excellent meal at BlueBlood. The ambiance was lovely and the service was great. I recommend the steak tartare and the table side Caesar in particular.,4
"We had our really good time to celebrate my 2 year old daughter‚Äôs birthday, we love the food the service and feel really welcome, we sure we‚Äôll be back soon.",4
"We always go to BlueBlood for special occasions and it never disappoints.
Top notch service and steaks are always perfectly cooked.",4
"Fantastic meal, drinks, and service. A gorgeous setting. Will go again!",4
"Took my boss who flew in for a nice steak dinner. He wanted something different‚Ä¶.. thought Blue Blood would fit the bill ‚Ä¶. It unwhelmed magnificently. The meal went downhill right from the bisque which was very thin in texture and flavour. Next the steaks ‚Ä¶ meh ‚Ä¶. We both could tell at the very first bite that it was nothing extraordinary very mainstream. Over all service was good, food was meh, value was eeek!

I will not be returning with guests I am hoping to impress.",2
"We had higher expectations of the food, especially the lamb chops. It wasn‚Äôt as tasty. The service and our waiter was amazing.",3
"Food, dessert, service and atmosphere were outstanding.",4
"Excellent birthday dinner this weekend- the food, especially the octopus and steak, and service were both amazing.",4
Food and service was excellent‚Ä¶ a bit noisy but overall great place,4
"Birthday.  Waiter was amazing, food was amazing.  The restaurant did seem to forget it was set as a birthday, I was hoping they would do something.  Drinks were good.  The cocktails were a tad pricey, but overall we will definitely come back.",4
"Enjoyed the drinks, the complimentary appetizer, the table side Caesar. THe octopus was not as vibrant as expected. The entrees and sides were delicious. Great service and great atmosphere. We stayed almost 3 hours and had lovely conversations. Will come again.",4
Best meal in years. Blown away by the level of service. Food and drinks couldn‚Äôt have been better,4
every moment was a show and an interesting experience. From a special house made Cesar Salad to an interesting and entertaining desert menu. Our waiter Gio was extraordinary and tries to leave you with a warm inviting friendly atmosphere.,4
A bit of a tourist trap. Not worth it. Foods not good.,1
Wonder food with great service and ambiance! Great location.,4
"Amazing all around. Staff, food, beveys, the architecture and hystortic beauty were all exceptional. A perfect place for business or personal",4
"We were greeted right away by amazing friendly staff. The service was very fast and kind. Staff was amazing and friendly. The food was amazing and great quality. Would
Highly recommend for everybody!!",4
Thanks to Dax for an amazing evening ! He made excellent recommendation to both myself and my partner and we enjoyed our night at the Blue Blood. It was our second time here and we made the trip from Montreal to come and celebrate the birthday of my partner at your restaurant and did not regret it ! Food topped off our last experience and we did not thought it was possible !,4
"It‚Äôs definitely an experience to try at least once. The ambiance, service, food, was all top tier. I really enjoyed myself and would definitely go back. David was amazing and made us feel comfortable. His suggestion were all delicious. I had a great birthday here.",4
"Honesty‚Ä¶I had higher expectations. I booked almost 2 months in advance for my birthday dinner at Blue Bloods. If I was gonna spend that much on a dinner ($485) for two, it was gonna be for my birthday. I was really disappointed with my steak, I got the Canadian Prime aged 28 days ribeye. It‚Äôs my favourite cut & I‚Äôve had it many many times. It was underwhelming to say the least. It wasn‚Äôt smooth like butter like I expected, the knife was dull & did not contribute to cutting the meat. It looked & tasted like a cheap cut from a mediocre place, it was not worth $120. The rack of lamb tho was really good & was huge. We got asparagus with hollandaise sauce, gratin, crab fritters & the blood chopped salad as our sides. They were the best tbh! The cocktail & drink menu was extensive & impressive as well. Overall ambience & experience was amazing but I have had better ribeyes at The Keg & The School. I think it‚Äôs a great experience but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd go back.",3
"Overall it was a very good experience. Service started out very good. But the busier it got, there more the staff started tending to clearly wealthier guests. Leaving us to feel awkward for asking for anything. The food was excellent and it was intimate. Just felt awkward towards the end.",3
We enjoyed our first dinner at the Blueblood Steakhouse last night to celebrate my husbands birthday! We both had a great time; the food was excellent and the service was even better. Our servers name was Stewart and he really made our experience enjoyable and memorable! Will definitely be back again.,4
My wife and I were celebrating her birthday. It was a great date night experience. Thank you!,4
Great evening. Our waiter and the overall staff was very professional and attentive.  We really enjoyed the food.,4
"Great meal, server overcharged for a steak that we didn‚Äôt order . Keep an eye on the bill .
Mistakes happen",4
"Honestly, it was such a disappointment. For the amount it costs the food was absolutely not worth it. I‚Äôve had way better steaks, the sides were ok and the drinks were astronomically expensive.  Total let down for the price.",2
Wagyu  was amazing‚Ä¶waiter was outstanding‚Ä¶we will go back next time in Toronto,4
"Had the most amazing meal and time celebrating a friends birthday. Our server Stuart was A++++, he had amazing recommendations and was overall just lovely to have as a server. 10/10 would go again (already made another reservation)",4
It was a celebration of 3 birthdays. The location and service was excellent. I felt the meal itself was average and very high priced.,3
"Great atmosphere with great service. Super nice staff. 

Parking was disappointing for the restaurant in this level. Not an inexpensive place, parking could be complementary.

The dishes doesn‚Äôt come with a side. Would be great to add a side and avid ordering it separately",3
"We went for a birthday and were impressed with the dining room and exterior or the castle. From once we entered, the staff were kind, gentle, and warm and welcoming. It was the best experience with staff in a dining establishment! The food was tasty (slightly over cooked grilled octopus and hamburger, a little heavy on the alcohol in the baked Alaska) most noticeable the juiciness of the wagyu burger and beautifully crunchy fries. The mushrooms were succulent and flavourful. Kalmata olives, cherry tomatoes, and grilled octopus are a delicious mix! Overall, definitely returning and recommend for your next occasion.",4
"Great food, great ambiance and outstanding service by our server Sandor!",4
"Absolutely delicious! I‚Äôm so sad I don‚Äôt remember the name of our waiter but he was so attentive and on point with service. We went to blueblood to celebrate our 10 year anniversary together! 

I ordered the barrel cut filet or something like that.. it was literally the most delicious cut of meat I have EVER hand. It was so tender and juicy, my knife was basically sliding through it! *chefs kiss*

It is pricy but my luxury lies in food so I didn‚Äôt mind spending but just keep that in mind when you decide to visiting! 

We also got the mushrooms (delicious) and garlic mashed potato‚Äôs (I didn‚Äôt care for them too much but my boyfriend enjoyed them). 

Overall would rate the restaurant an 8/10. We went on a beautiful and a bee flew through the window and kept bothering us so that was annoying but other than that, great experience!",4
"Service was exceptional. Food was top notch. Original seating when we arrived was in the dining room that has the bar area in it, and seated next to a table with 5 kids at it (9pm at night). The entire room was over the top noisy for fine dining. Thankfully there was seating available in the Oak Room dining room where the noise level was a touch better and lighting a little more subdued. Again, service and food exceptional. For those looking for a more intimate/quiet evening this may not be your jam.",4
"Hi I‚Äôve already emailed. We have 4 of us prefix $2,000. All our steaks were over cooked. We were so hungry and embarrassed no one said anything as we were hosting guests. We finished bottle of champagne and could not get anyone‚Äôs attention nor did they come to the table for a bottle of wine for steaks which we had mentioned on the champagne order to go with oysters. 
We waited over an hour after dinner and no drink service. We finally left, went to show and had drinks there. 
Very disappointed given price point. I suppose being prepaid no one really requires to up sell??? Anyway won‚Äôt be back. Far over rated and over priced.",1
"The scallops were uncooked(raw), the burger was over cooked(asked for medium), and the beef carpaccio was flavorless.  There was a waiter that we encountered while walking to the restroom, he spoke extremely rude to us for no reason.  Overall a very bad experience, especially at that price.",0
"It was good. For the prices of the menu, I didn‚Äôt think it was excellent. It has great ambiance. My rack of lamb was overdone. The tuna tartare, polenta and carpaccio are incredible! Love that they are also super accommodating for accessibility.",3
We had a lovely time food ambiance service all top notch. Totally recommend if in Toronto.,3
Could not find anything wrong at all with our dinner and or service,4
"I love the experience. The only thing that I didn‚Äôt like is the chairs they was over used it looks like, but after that was everything amazing",4
"Outstanding service and food
As always
Thank you Blueblood",4
Fantastic service and food. Made for an exceptional night with family.,4
"First time dining at BlueBlood, the atmosphere and the staff were amazing.

The restaurant was more nicer inside than I expected.",4
"Beautiful atmosphere.
Great service. 
It was our first time visiting Blue Blood. We were celebrating our 25th Anniversary.
The food was delicious. Rib eye was cooked to perfection (medium rare). Wifey‚Äôs tenderloin was just the way she likes it.
Garlic mash were the best we‚Äôve had and the duck fat fries are definitely a must if you haven‚Äôt tried them.
We got to visit the wine cellar and were also given a brief tour through some hidden passageways in the castle.
Very cool place.
Will definitely be going back. üôåüëç",4
"We celebrated our anniversary at BlueBlood. The drinks were very nicely presented, the appetizers were delicious, and the meal very nice too. Overall, a very pleasant experience.",3
The food as always was delicious. The vibes were fabulous.,4
"Got the vip package for dinner followed by the illusionist shows. The food was amazing and the shows were great, too. Great night overall.",4
"A major step up from previous visits that deserves to be acknowledged. The service was outstanding and the food significantly better. Terrific steaks, using much better cuts than in the past, in my opinion. Side dishes are still only average (saut√©ed spinach was not tasty; fries were so so, being too thick to cook properly), but the desserts were exceptional: coconut cream pie and apple pie were both very large and very good. Excellent waiter service all round. Very knowledgeable sommelier with no pretension. And credit to the front bar staff who have clearly upped their game compared to the grumps they had out there in the past. Cocktails though continue to be laughably over-priced, with some over $40 per drink, the excuse being ‚Äúpremium ingredients‚Äù. Uh huh. Cmon guys, that‚Äôs just exploitive. All in all, a very good night. Bring the fat version of your wallet though: dinner for three with two bottles of wine plus tax and tip was $1,400+.",3
"Staff is so kind, the food is so amazing, the building is historic, and the vibes are immaculate. 11/10.",4
"Vale la pena el lugar!
Rica comida y el servicio de lo mejor",3
"LOL

You're eating in an escape room basically.

My bill was $3,200 for 4 people.

Also, the waiter was really, really pushy.

Go ahead, throw your money away.",2
Beautiful setting for a special dinner. View of the setting sun and skyline casts a warm glow inside the restaurant.  The surf dishes are as tasty as the beef choices. The wait staff were attentive and friendly and the meal was perfectly timed.,4
"It was lovely, but it is not the best steak I have had? Cool venue but still overpriced. Portions are a good size. Deserts are cool, fun and delicious! 
Would not recommend for steak, but would recommend for the experience!",2
Celebrated our anniversary last night at BlueBlood Steakhouse.  We dined in the beautiful formal dining room and it was lovely with a great ambiance as it was full for a Monday night.  The staff was very attentive and friendly.  The food was exceptional. It is one of our favourite restaurants. It was a wonderful evening.,4
Awesome service and food!! Highly recommend! We go often and it does not disappoint!! Dax is amazing,4
Absolutely amazing!!!,4
"Four of us attended to celebrate a birthday and had been told that BlueBlood was a special place. We were seated at a table with two seats on a padded bench facing two chairs. The chairs were great but the other two seats were low and not very comfortable. The Caesar salad made at the table was among the best any of us have ever had. The main courses were adequate but unremarkable. The noise level in the room reduced our ability to enjoy conversation . Overall, we would say that we had hoped for a much better experience in general particularly when taking the premium prices charged into account.",2
"Food was mediocre at best except for tuna tartare and shrimp cocktail which were both very good. Caesar, steak and desert did not meet expectations.",2
"Incredible food, incredible atmosphere, incredible setting.",4
The perfect place for a celebration or any special day!,4
One of the very high level steakhouses I have dined in. Service was excellent. cesar salad was the best I have ever had.,4
"Absolutely amazing experience! The food was the best I‚Äôve ever had! I had the American Wagyu filet mignon which was so buttery smooth and simply delicious. My partner had the 28 day aged 12oz filet which had such a rich flavour and depth to it. The appetizer of Housemade Gravlax was lovely.

Service was impeccable! Lovely waiter and sommelier!",4
"Overall the experience was not worth the money I spent. I feel like I would have been happier going to a steak restaurant chain. The food was good, but nothing special. Service was very good and professional. The 135$ wine tasted like the same wine I bought the day before for $10, but the Sommelier made the experince worth it somewhat.",2
This is definitely a historic gem hidden in the middle of a modern city. The place is very cosy and the staff are very welcoming. The food is amazing as expected.,4
"Great ambience, nice food and wonderful service. Located in the casaloma castle and personally I think it's a must visit if you're in Toronto and looking for somewhere to celebrate anniversary. Food is a bit overpriced in consider of its quality. We spent 500 for 2 people. I appreciate the waiter who took pictures for us all around the castle. It was a wonderful night.",3
Great attention to detail. Watching the 2 mixologists make their art was so fun.,4
Food was absolutely scrumptious. Ample parking and accessible. You can also tour ground level of the castle.,3
The steak was great and thd flame crepes very tasty and a fun experience. The feel of the place is pretty laid back and service was spot on,4
Our server David was awesome! Amazing food and service! 10/10 night! Our salad guy too was the sweetest and kept us laughing the whole time ! Will return back soon!,4
Great atmosphere and the food has excellent presentation. Service was impeccable,4
"Amazing food, incredible service. The food is expensive but worth the splurge for a special occasion.",4
"Perfect spot to catch up with friends. The round booth is super-cosy and made it really easy to chat, even in a lively restaurant. The Caesar salad was light and flavourful, wagyu taster was amazing, duck-fat fries were delicious. There were so many great options on the dessert menu. I couldn‚Äôt pass up the cr√®me br√ªl√©e, but need to go back to try the others.",4
"We had a wonderful birthday celebration dinner and experience at Blue Blood.
Being in the castle itself is what sets this place apart. The room we were in was completely panelled in the original dark oak with master hand-carved designs on every edge in the room.
I found the seats themselves look great and fit the aesthetic but a little awkward to sit in.
For food, we started with cocktails, then had the Caesar salad made at our table, along with the wagyu carpaccio. They were excellent.
We had fillets for our mains along with the whipped mash and asparagus for sides. Again, excellent. Don‚Äôt miss the whipped mash‚Ä¶ melts in your mouth and full of buttery goodness.
The one complaint I had about the fillets is they served them to us on cast iron plates. I can‚Äôt stand the smell of cast iron plates, which was a huge distraction for me and something I‚Äôd expect at the Keg and other chains, but not a high end place like this.
We had an excellent bottle of California Red to accompany our meal. Sommelier pointed us in the right direction as the bottle we had planned from reviewing their wine menu online was no longer available.
We wrapped up with the the baked Alaska set alight at the table. Super fun and delicious.
Way more food than any two people can eat so we brought some home.
Will definitely book again for an impressive evening.
There are private glass ‚Äúpods‚Äù outside, and when it gets warmer I‚Äôll look to book one of these for a romantic dinner experience.
Tip: use your credit card with the best points multiplier for restaurants‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll rack them up here very quickly!!",4
"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at your restaurant, food was exceptional,atmosphere was beautiful, our server was very knowable, thank you for a good evening",4
"Food and service were great, best table side prepared Caesar Salad in the GTA!",4
"Best service at a restaurant I ever had. The food and presentation was fantastic, the chef couldn‚Äôt have been more inviting. Best experience bar none.",4
"Almost everything about the evening was great (from the sommelier/waitstaff, to the appetizers, to the other little nuances etc). However, when I go to a steakhouse (esp one of this alleged caliber), I expect the steak to be above average. On this particular night, it was underwhelming for the entire party. Some steaks were over cooked, some under. Perhaps an off night for the folks in the kitchen? We were all looking forward to the steak that night, and they failed to deliver.",1
I would suggest the couch seating needed to be refurbished/fixed. I had a hard time sitting comfortably and relaxing  while eating simultaneously.,2
"60th birthday - was an amazing experience !!

We had a wonderful time. The food, ambiance and service was excellent would recommend.",4
"Everything was amazing, from the food to the service. First time here but will be back again.",4
We had a great dinner celebrating a birthday.  While it is definitely pricey the portions were great steak and lamb cooked to perfection and they didn‚Äôt cut any corners on service.  I would return for sure.  The dress of customers was more casual than I anticipated again not a bad thing just surprised me,4
Great ambiance! Amazing food! Fast service! Fresh food and friendly service. Servers were very involved and offered great pairings with meal.,4
"Grilled prawns and steak were amazing. Tuna tartare: too much avocado for the amount of tuna. Useless. 
Scallops, amazing, but the risotto under was a little too greasy. 

Great service

Not enough wine by the glass, I‚Äôm afraid 

A good overall experience. We‚Äôll be back",3
"The experience was one of a kind.

The ambience and overall was absolutely amazing.",4
"Unfortunately the steak we ordered was cold when it was served to our table. 

Would have liked to be seated at a better table. We were seated by the server‚Äôs station.  Very distracting.",3
"The steaks were delicious and the waiters were all very friendly, thoughtful (looked out for my dietary restrictions and made recommendations based on it) and efficient.  The atmosphere was delightful and we hope to go back in the future.",4
"For the price of the food that is listed, the food was okay. My steak came out cold. The spinach side with the quail egg was over salted and just did not taste good. The octopus appetizer was the best, the waiter was great so the service was superb.",2
"This was our second visit to BlueBlood within the past month and the service and food was just as amazing as our previous visit !

Jonathon our sommelier was fantastic! He helped us choose the perfect wine , our server Costa helped us pick our perfect meal!  Thank you to everyone who had a hand in our overall experience!

I honestly can‚Äôt say anything negative about our experience!!!

We had an amazing time and look forward to visiting again.",4
"Went for a birthday dinner, service was excellent, appetizers were great, service was fast, alcohol was overpriced, did not like that they kept pushing refills, main courses were good to proper temperature, sides were large enough to share, best onion rings, fries were ok, but were overhyped, overall the experience was good, but for the money, there are better experiences to be had at the same level of dining.",3
Food was Great ....Service was even Better!!! I would recommend BlueBlood Steakhouse to anyone.,4
Wouldn‚Äôt recommend. Our waiter was not nice at all. Food was sub-par. Not what we were expecting for our celebration dinner.,0
"Best experience we had at a restaurant. Everyone needs to go here at least once just to experience. Food was amazing, staff was amazing, extremely helpful and knowledgeable.",4
"Excellent service from Stewart, lovely meal And ambience",4
The fine restaurant in old Casa Loma is a great venue with terrific food and service.  Our only criticism of it is its ambience with the two colourful portraits hanging on the wall.  They are so out of place.  And the proprietors could have chosen a better name for the establishment.  BlueBlood just doesn't evoke good thoughts and it is not very Canadian.   Email me back if you want some suggestions on appropriate paintings and names.,4
We went there for a special dinner where I proposed to my girlfriend on the castle grounds. The staff there went above and beyond to help me arrange everything and provided us with a wonderful and memorable experience!,4
"Excellent restaurant and meal! Perfect for a special occasion, and lots of fantastic and high quality menu items to choose from.",4
"Seafood tower was great. A lot of table side dishes like baked Alaska, Caesar salad",3
I cannot say enough about this restaurant. We came to celebrate my birthday and the entire dinner was fabulous; including the service. Our waiter paid attention to detail and didn‚Äôt miss a beat on our needs. I look forward to our next visit here.,4
"Beautiful place, great service, delicious food! It‚Äôs worth to try it",4
"Service a litte spotty,  no 6oz filet mignon-boo
overall would experience",2
"Amazing experience. First timers to the castle - it is a must see @ least once! But for us that was all it was! The price for what you get does not seem worth it. The steak was perfectly cooked but despite being the most expensive steak I have ever eaten, it wasn‚Äôt even close to the best. Tbh I have had way better steaks at the keg. I‚Äôm super glad we trialed blueblood however I do not feel like we‚Äôd go back!",2
Dinner was amazing.  Service great.  All in all a memorable experience.,4
The steak was a bit of disappointment as we expect better quality in this high class steak house,3
"Great service, relaxing atmosphere and great value compared to other high end steakhouses‚Ä¶.",4
"Excellent Ambiance, Meal and service - the Birthday acknowledgement was wonderful - thank you!!",4
"What can I say.  Speechless sums it up. From the tables use service, the wine list, cocktails, food, ambience and the graciousness of the servers.  Upper level all the way. First class establishment run by a first class organization.",4
"Excellent food & drinks. Server was very nice but wish she was more attentive. Had to wait a while at times, esp when it was clear that we were complete and in need of the server",3
"$20.00 to Valet park to eat at restaurant.   Food was decent, but very overpriced.",3
"Our server was very friendly and helpful and Christine the Sommelier was fantastic and so kind to arrange a tour of Casa Loma for us between our meal and dessert.  It was a special treat.  Blue Blood has a romantic, moody vibe but perfect for a great meal with friends and family as well.  The food is outstanding and Alejandro made us a delicious Caesar salad table side.  We will return and looking forward to enjoying Blue Blood with our friends.",4
"BlueBloods was an expensive experience but one we walked away from, feeling it was worth every penny. Service was outstanding, professional, and subtle. Our server was so knowledgeable about every aspect of food and beverages. Our meals and side dishes, appetizers and dessert were truly incredible! They gifted my husband a small birthday gift, from Casa Loma. So thoughtful and unexpected. The way they packaged our leftovers was so lovely, in a reusable Casa Loma canvas bag, placed on a small stool beside our table. Overall, everything was exquisite!",4
Visit to Toronto! Girlfriends getaway from NYC. Had to have the BlueBloods experience. Sergio was the best server!,4
"The venue is beautiful. There was a wedding on though so we couldn‚Äôt do a half hour walk around the castle before.
Seats are comfortable and the round tables are great for a group.  The food selection is broad, but I walked away spending $800 for two apps, a bottle of wine, two cocktails and one dessert with our entree and it was just okay.  I expected outstanding.
We had the 8oz filet and 18 year aged prime rib with broccolini and mushrooms.  The vegetables were great, I‚Äôve had better steaks for half the bill else where.  They just didn‚Äôt melt in your mouth.

It‚Äôs a great experience.  I am glad we did it once, but I will not be back.
I would suggest if going with a group splitting a prime rib and vegetables.
Apps are amazing, you can even do a selection of those.
Desserts are all large enough to share.",3
"We had a very good experience there. Food was amazing, service was good atmosphere was good as well. Overall a great dinner.",3
"Beautiful atmosphere, great service and delicious food. We went for our 25th anniversary and we were not  disappointed!",4
"Food quality was incredible, the service was impeccable. 
Was our first time, will definitely be back",4
"Honestly just fantastic. Fine dinning experience. Food was perfect. Not cheap but worth it.

Ask for Jesse. Great server.

Enjoy",4
Dinner was beyond my expectations. Room was an intimate size and the aroma even was incredible. We arrived early and walked around for 10 mins and then were sat. Will be back for sure.,4
The premier dining experience in Toronto. If you haven‚Äôt been you must go. The food was incredible and the service was excellent. The atmosphere is unmatched. 5/5!,4
Very disappointed‚Ä¶second time in a row our steak was undercooked. Not acceptable for what they charge.  We definitely won‚Äôt be returning,2
"I've dined at blue blood before and everything was amazing. I decided to take my husband for Valentine's Day and the food was horrible, I don't know if they had a different chef because it was a busy day but the food was bad.",0
Great experience ! Really recommend. I hope you enjoy.,4
The food was amazing. The atmosphere is over the top. I would definitely go back.,4
"Tourists trap
Never going back there
Food isn‚Äôt worth the price
Service is very poor
Very disappointed",0
"This was an early Valentine‚Äôs dinner, my husband and I purchased dinner as part of a package along with the Twilight Symphony performance. Our dinner was prix fixe which had a wonderful selection.  I ordered the Lobster bisque and main was was the striploin with classic cheesecake for dessert, everything was prepared, served, presented and cooked to perfection. An unbelievable experience and memorable night!
So great to see Casa Loma offering such wonderful experiences!",4
"Great food, great service, great building and furniture. Perfect night out",4
"Everything was perfect!   The food is incredible, service was flawless. The sommelier was very knowledgeable and the desserts were the perfect end to a wonderful meal.  Try the baked Alaska!",4
"After being disappointed by several other high end steak houses in the city, we had high expectations but Blueblood delivered.

You don't go to steakhouses for value, but for what we paid, everything was worth it. Excellent service, lovely atmosphere (I mean how could it not be), helpful and friendly staff at every turn.

Thank you for a fantastic evening. We will be back again!",4
"Exceptional service, food was delicious as always.",4
What an experience! Order the Caesar salad and watch them make it from scratch! Such an elegant and beautiful meal!,4
"We had a great experience at BlueBlood's; the restaurant interiors were so beautiful, food was incredible and above all the service was amazing. Definitely on the pricier side, it is great for special occasions!",4
I would suggest that the meal was good however for the cost perhaps over rated.,2
"Nice place , good food good service . Steak was cooked perfectly",4
"Overall amazing but steak was the only issue. Told the server that it was overcooked and they just apologized for the inconvenience and told us they gave the chef feedback. Otherwise, food and service was phenomenal!!",4
"Our favorite spot in T.O :)  never disappointed, food is great, service is outstanding , original drinks and good vibe! Super recommend!",4
Service was outstanding and the ambience was terrific!,4
"Good overall value, nice location, staffs are friendly.",3
"The candlelight symphony after dinner was an exquisite conclusion to the evening. Had a drink with the host Katorina and her husband Maestro Paulo. Wonderful people. Overall, food was excellent. Our server Gio was a personality plus. The symphonic experience was absolutely worth it.",4
Came here for my husbands birthday! It‚Äôs definitely a place for a nice treat or occasion. The vibes are really nice. The sea bass and rib eye were cooked so well. Had the baked Alaska for dessert and it came with a show! The waiter was especially attentive and he was great :) Enjoyed the dinner.,4
"Absolutely fabulous experience! We went for the symphony event and the entire evening from start to finish was lovely. Great service, amazing symphony and great food.",4
"We went for my birthday and they nothing special. 
We ordered a cake and they wrote happy birthday on it with a candle (standard). Food was okay and we were seated at a very small table by the window.",0
"We chose Blueblood Steakhouse to celebrate our daughter's birthday, very glad we did!! Really enjoyed our dinner.
Jacob was serving us and he is excellent, has outstanding customer service skills. He made our time at the restaurant, special.",4
"Bluebloods @ Casa Loma was quite the experience.
The ambiance of the old castle certainly set the stage for a memorable time.
The food was outstanding in all categories and the wait staff were knowledgeable on all aspects of food/drink and pairing .
All in all fabulous.",4
"Beautiful restaurant and good food, good for anniversary and celebration",4
"I don‚Äôt even know where to begin. This place was simply amazing from top to bottom. Our food, service, and setting was top notch. First time here and in Canada but won‚Äôt be the last.",4
"An absolutely delightful evening. Worth every penny, and then some!
Celebrating my partner's milestone birthday. For appetizers, he had the beef carpaccio, I had the big eye tuna tartare.  For mains, he had the Cdn Ribeye, med-rare, along with an order of garlic whipped potatoes. I had the scallops. The meal was complimented with an Apple Cider and a glass of wine. The meal, service and ambiance were excellent. Our server, Connor, provided a special memento to commemorate the special outing. Jeannine was entertaining in preparing our tableside-made Baked Alaska for dessert.

After dinner, enjoy a stroll to view unseen rooms including the library, dining room and conservatory. 

Room for improvement:

1. Washrooms - the room itself is gender-neutral, so you could be in a stall across from anyone. The custodian does a good job of keeping it clean, but it is odd to have a man in there while women are using the facilities. I went twice, he was there both times.

2. The lounge-like chairs for dining - On one hand, they were comfortable for lounging, but not for dining. It was awkward (only one side has an armrest) and not comfortable for dining purposes. In future, I will request to sit on a different table.",4
Loved everything! Thank you so much for making my birthday dinner so special!,4
"we were seated promptly then everything after that went down hill, from timing of drinks to appetizers.
The kid making the table side caesar dropped the dirty cloth from his cart into our dressing that he just made for 15 minutes , pulled it out and served it to us like nothing happened.
All 3 medium steaks were rare and cold and the rare steak was blue.
Lobster tail rubbery and undercooked, very fishy smelling and tasting.
35 minutes to get a drink another 35 for a second.
when we mentioned the lack of service/poor service our waiter replied we try not to bother our guests to enjoy the experience?
Yet all around us two sometimes three staff were all over other guests talking explaining items even sitting at tables going over menus with them.
I explained my Family obviously was not important enough to have the same service.
Very unhappy with the entire outing.
Will never go back, we have dined at celebrity restaurants and when paying 1000$ for meals I expect the best.",1
Amazing experience.,4
Decor and food and service spectacular,4
"We had steak , mushrooms and onion rings , delicious and hot right to our table , We also were given cheesy flakey buns to start , We were seated by the window with a pretty view so it was very relaxing, The service was perfect from when we entered until we finished our meal ,, We were happy with food . For dessert we had baked Alaska prepared at our table which was fun , It was my birthday so they put a candle and also chocolate edible birthday sign on the dessert, We will definitely come back, Excellent dining experience from beginning to end, Also easy parking for 15.00 right beside restaurant",4
"Our server, Sergio was the ultimate professional, but personable. He made the evening special.",4
Celebrating my daughter‚Äôs birthday.,4
"Another wonderful experience
Never fails !!
Try the sesame tuna / outstanding",4
"My wife and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary by dining at Blue Blood Steakhouse for the first time. Everything about our experience lived up to, even surpassed, our expectations. James, our server, was fantastic, and his colleagues were terrific. My wife and I thank James and Dejon for the little complimentary anniversary gift; it was sweet and unexpected. My wife and I felt very welcome from the moment we arrived. We also recognised that each dish was perfect, and unlike anything we had experienced before. My wife and I agreed that we enjoyed our best dining experience ever, and that we would recommend BBSH to anyone! Thank you all of Blue Blood Steakhouse so much!",4
"Everything was great! The people, the food! Overall was fantastic!",4
"Don‚Äôt recommend this place for an intimate dinner for 2. Went there for our anniversary and they just stuck us at the main entrance where the servers and guests would hangout and talk and stand around all night. 

Our table was extremely crowded at all times, the ceaser salad guy got bumped and moved while trying to make it for us. 

You get large portions and the steak was superb. The valet rushes you to the steakhouse and doesn‚Äôt allow you to take any photos outside - what‚Äôs the point? 

Even rushed afterwards. 

Overall? Too expensive and wouldn‚Äôt go back with the way we were treated.",1
"I came to this restaurant for a intimate dinner with friends for my birthday. The ambiance was amazing very classy. Place wasn‚Äôt too noisy like other restaurants I‚Äôve been to so we were able to have great conversation and really catch up. Food was delicious, the Caesar salad was made fresh at out table side and was to die for. For my main I had lamp chops and the lobster Mac and cheese both were delicious. Overall it was an amazing experience, I will be returning in the near future.",4
Birthday celebration for my daughter. Our server Alex was awesome. Ambiance and food delicious. We had a great evening.,4
"The food was amazing, went there with my wife for our wedding anniversary and we'll definitely be back. Next time we'll ask for a quieter seating though, there was a big table right by us and they were very noisy",4
It was one of the best experiences I had ever. Best food amazing servers and beautiful surroundings just loved it! Would definitely come back.,4
"Very different experience from the last time we dined here pre-pandemic. Service was okay but not at the level I would expect for a place like Blueblood (missing drink orders, not refilling water, forgetting things).

The ambiance is great aside from the ugly plexiglas half-moon windows around some of the curved banquette seating in front of the bar.

Dietary restrictions were accommodated; instead of Gruy√®re buns my brother was offered parsnip chips, which he enjoyed. Steaks were cooked to perfection. Seared scallops were excellent on a bed of squid ink risotto. The seafood ‚Äútower‚Äù was sadly a massive letdown. 

We recalled (pre-pandemic) a three-tiered platter crammed with salmon and tuna tartares, lobsters, king crab, oysters and shrimp. This platter was TINY by comparison and was much smaller with less variety than we previously enjoyed. I was not satisfied and felt as though the experience with this platter was sorely lacking and it was not worth the $80pp price at all.

The sorbet was lovely and all in all, a great experience, but if you are looking for a great seafood tower to wow your guests, try a different place (35 Tank House Lane)!",3
"The food, service, ambience was perfect",4
"It was fabulous! From our service, to the atmosphere, to the food! All incredible! We went for my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday and it did not disappoint! Our server Sergio was wonderful and the food was delicious! We shared a 16oz Ribeye and a lobster tail! Amazing! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",4
This is our third year Anniversary. The service is great. The food is amazing.,4
The food was very good.  The  sommelier chose our wine with consideration that complemented our meal and was in our price range. The service was great and the staff was polite and pleasant in their dispositions.  We were celebrating my wife's birthday with the family and it was truly an enjoyable and memorable experience.  I truly appreciate coming to a place that honours the heritage of this great city in a genuine way.  I hope it doesn't ever lose its character.  Thanks for the memory.,3
"Came to celebrate a very special friend's birthday.  Our waiter, Dax, and our chef salad preparer, Susan, were very professional, friendly, and helped make our dinner event special.

Also, appreciated the friendliness and excellent service from Ashley, Floor Manager.",3
"My experience there always it‚Äôs a good one, great service, good food, place it‚Äôs a awesome.",4
This is definitely a special occasion spot. Food was wxpertly prepared and served with flair. We felt like royalty!,4
"Food was great, when the steak came out my date noticed there was a hair in it. There were quick to replace it and gave us a complimentary dessert. Overall was a great experience. Next time I will request a table always from the windows because I could feel a draft from outside but otherwise service and ambience was great. Second time eating here and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be coming back.",4
We had a wonderful experience for my wife‚Äôs birthday. Highly recommend!,4
"Menu was pretty good lots of options however, it appears every item on that menu is over priced by at least 20% compared to other high-end steakhouses probably will not go there again not bad as a tourist type destination though if you‚Äôre dying to see the castle",2
Waiter was rude and neglecting. Food was over rated.,0
"Such a great spot! The food was excellent, the dining all was beautiful and the service was impeccable. Would come back again for sure!!!",4
"Took my girlfriend here for her birthday, was the best meal and dining experience either of us have ever had. Our waiter Andy was phenomenal, some of the best service either of us have ever had as well. The table-side dessert to end the night is a must-have and came served with a few surprises for her birthday.",4
"Undercooked steak, twice.  3 mins in an oven won't take a filet from blue to med rare. Very disappointing for a $75 steak.

Table side ceaser was amazing. Server that did it was engaging and all smiles.

Sides were bland and luke warm. Mashed potatoes were cold and brocolini was crunchy.

Would have 100% done another round of drinks and a dessert but we were completely turned off by the mains. 

Were both industry professionals and felt very disappointed and almost certainly were treated poorly due to our young age. Spent well over $400 including a 20% tip.

Will not recommend.  Server assistant doing our salad was the highlight of the evening.",0
"Beautiful space, a great vibe, and a very attentive and knowledgeable server.
The food was good, but not quite as outstanding as the space itself.",3
We had my son‚Äôs birthday there! We loved everything from the food to ambiance to our server.,4
Took my boyfriend to dinner for his birthday we loved the experience ! No complaints on the food everything was very tasty and we enjoyed the at table banana crepes dessert. Drinks were on point. The service was more than good and overall the vibe was cozy and perfect for a nice romantic date night. Price was on the expensive side but it was expected. We wont be going there every week but for a special occasion its an experience worth trying. We had an amazing night,4
Great atmosphere especially in the bar. Appetizers and desserts were A1. Main entrees were disappointing. Had better steaks elsewhere. Get ready to empty your pockets and then some!   Not worth the cost $$$$$$$$$$$$!,3
Food was excellent and delicious and the table side Cesar salad was excellent!!,4
"The prime ribs are amazingly good, we enjoyed all the food that we ordered. Highly recommended, we will surely be back.",4
Excellent dining and service.,4
Overpriced. One of those places you go to only once. Nothing special at all. The room had a very old schooled look. The chairs were very uncomfortable. The food is ridiculously priced and not even anything special at all. Could have gone to a  number of other places for a better experience.,0
"I and my husband spent his 30th birthday here. We ordered and enjoyed the lobster bisque, tuna tartare, and 35 day aged dried tomahawk! We also ordered a wine (brunello de montalcino) to pair with the tomahawk. We also had crepe for dessert üíïü´∞ Everything was amazing!",4
Caesar Salad was excellent along with the Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e. Steak was pretty good but our seafood dishes were subpar. Service was good to start but trailed off as the meal service went on.,2
Classy ambience.  Food is delicious. Nice place for fine dining.,4
The food her is high quality and delicious.  The setting is incredible.,4
"BlueBlood is one of the best Steakhouses in Toronto.  It is in Casa Loma, which definitely adds to the experience, and great for all you social media types and photographers. The ambiance and deco is amazing, food is spectacular and the service is great.  Like all good steakhouses on the expensive side for some budgets but definitely worth every penny.  4 Adults, and 2 children with a small amount of alcohol, appetizers and desert is ~$1,200 for our family. So for us with tip was just over $1,500.  You can definitely do it a little cheaper, no cocktails, skip appetizers,  desert, etc. but just to give you a feel what it is going to run you.  PS everything is good on the menu.",4
Amazing experience,4
Food is very overpriced but doesn‚Äôt taste good or good quality. I ordered lobster bisque - I got some soup and 2 pieces of lobster in it. Wasn‚Äôt impressed at all. Plenty of good steakhouses in the city but this one definitely gets a fail. You have better luck going harbour 60 or the Keg even.,0
"This time we choose casa loma to celebrate NYE. The food is always fantastic and no matter what I order. From the starter to the dessert the quality and tastes of everything was outstanding. Servers are also great and always efficient, happy and polite. This is my absolute favorite restaurant in town.",4
Best steak ever,4
"Second time here, brought 3 couples for New Year‚Äôs Eve and the service was the worst I‚Äôve ever experienced!!! It turned into an absolute disaster of an evening and at that price point I expected more! Our waiter was not attentive, really just went through the most basic motions. Complained to management and was a waste of breath. We will not be returning",2
"I‚Äôve been to BB on many occasions and must say that our experience New Year‚Äôs Eve was truly outstanding. The service was impeccable from the very moment we were greeted by the parking attendant to the front hostess and then of course, the wait staff.

The food was fresh, flavorful and just the right portions. Ambiance is second to none (we sat in the Oak Room)

It was also pleasurable to walk off the meal with a mini stroll along the castle corridors.

We‚Äôve been craving the Wagyu ever since so expect to be back soon.",4
"Food was impeccable and service was good till dessert. Waited over 15 -20 mins for a bad baked Alaska,  they didn't take if off the bill, despite spending over $2,000 for a 2 person dinner.

Forgot our coffee and little things count, in my opinion.

If you want me to pay, I'm happy to do so, but I expect the best then. They didn't fold my napkin when I got up to use the rest room. That is a thumbs down in my opinion for a fine dining restaurant.",3
"Great drinks and Caesar Salad, but the steak was mediocre and the whole thing was overpriced.",2
"The food was good, but the price was higher then I felt was worth it. This was a bit of a failing on my part as I should have checked more closely online. The desserts were really good though.",2
"Amazing experience, will be back.  The tomahawk steak is the best in Toronto",4
Food very good but be aware that side dishes are not included and very expensive.Can be shared by two people,3
The ambiance is really nice but the food is quite overpriced for the quality and flavour. Definitely expected better when it came to the food. Service was good.,2
It was our Holiday family dinner out.  Service was amazing and the food delicious.  Presentation was amazing! Had a wonderful time.,4
"Service was very good, quick, informed, accommodating.",4
"The waiter was boy very kind. Other than that, our experience was very good.",2
"It was an amazing experience.
Keep up the outstanding service.",4
"This is a special place to go. The service is impeccable, the food is very good although I gave it 4 stars because I‚Äôm not a fan of the thick cut French fry. The ambiance is lovely however I feel the art is a little dated. We went on Christmas Eve and I felt it was a little loud. 
Although I may sound a bit critical, this is my honest review and I do recommend this restaurant especially for the service and the food!!",4
Great place for a nice (but expensive) dinner. Perfect ambiance for Xmas. Awesome staff.,4
Exceptional quality and good service. Keep up the good work!,4
Absolutely perfect Christmas Eve experience!,4
"A great family spot for Christmas dinner! Food, drinks, and atmosphere wonderful!",4
My girlfriend,4
"Great service , lovely staff and first class food, very expensive üòâ",4
"The most important thing is that the food did not live up to the price. I was shocked at how basic the tartar was for 34$. It was very minimalist, I expected more herbs and richness. The portion size was small and the bread was stale. I requested that it be remade and the second attempt was way better but I was under the impression there would be bone marrow in the tartar so that made a big impact on my experience. The name of the dish was misleading and started off my meal with me feeling very dissapointed and with lowered perception of the restaurant. The lamb was average for 75$ The truffle gratin lacked seasoning and that delicious cheesey goodness 24$.


The ambience is what I would expect from a castle. The service was good but I was not blown away by any means. There was a genuine attempt from the team to make us happy but I still felt a bit taken in the end.

The overall increase in the cost of goods has had a major impact on pricing but there needs to be more innovation to compenste.",1
"Fantastic dinner. It was a nice Christmas treat. Great service, great food, amazing setting. On the pricey side for us but worth every penny for a special occasion.",4
Excellent food and atmosphere for a special night out.,4
The dining is a excellent experience. The decor beautiful,3
"The food was good, not great‚Ä¶. and for the proce you want great.  Service was good - we didn‚Äôt fetcan apoetizer we ordeted‚Ä¶. but we weren‚Äôt charged for it.",2
"We went to Blueblood steakhouse to celebrate our engagement and anniversary. We loved the ambiance and vibe in the restaurant. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. He went into detail and took care of our concerns .
We ordered two steaks and the lobster Mac and cheese . We loved every single bite ! I highly recommend this restaurant for its steaks.

One thing I thought could have been done better is that they didn't do anything to celebrate our special night. We have been to many other restaurants where anniversary's or birthdays have been celebrated and we felt like that part was completely ignored . I had left it in the notes and nothing was said or done about it.",3
Andy was our waiter and he‚Äôs amazing. My sister had a great time at her birthday dinner. We definitely plan to revisit in the near future.,3
"Yesterday I took my husband for his birthday and from the opening of the front door to the greeting from the receptionist to the restaurant staffers I was just in an ü•∞. We felt as VIP. The staff were all superb.  The food was the best part of my experience. I had the rib eye steak and my gosh the food is something to talk about. Overall, the experience at BlueBlood was great!",4
Customer service was amazing. The table caesar salad was to die for i still think about. Their steak wasn't as good as i thought it would be. They said portions were shareable I beg to differ. Definitely salad and cake could split between more than two .,3
"Definitely pricey, but the dishes were delicious and portion sizes were good.",4
"The valet parking was great upon arrival.  I got the special banquette that I requested. It was comfortable and our service was attentive and even brought a special table for my handbag.  The table side preparation of the caesar salad was well done and it was delicious. They use their own bacon/lardons and the croutons were uniquely done.  Not so hard as usual.  Apparently olive oil is drizzled on them before they are baked in the oven. Very good. The steaks and the lamb were all prepared as ordered.  After dinner we took photos in front of the huge christmas tree.
Our server appeared and offered to take photos of the group. The valet service had already brought the car as soon as our dinner was complete.  Great service and food!
The interior of the building reminds us of the Breakers in Palm Beach",4
The food and service was great!,4
"Great food, great service all around, and beautiful venue.",3
"Great ambience, excellent food and service, highly recommended",4
The steak and the salads are both really good,4
"Oysters and Tomahawk, my choice. Magestic place, great ambiance, service is just perfect and more.",4
If u like steaks‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ this is the place FOR YOU. My bf loved it! The ambiance is just..wow! The service is just‚Ä¶BEAUTIFUL and our side Ceaser was absolutely amazing. So good,3
"As first time visitors, this was the most incredible experience. From the ambience and service to the food, it was fantastic. We will definitely be returning.",4
"We had dinner plans for 7pm last night. First off, the staff tried to place me in a room, despite the fact that I requested (2 months ago) that I wanted to sit in the main dining area. Then, at 7pm they had no lobster bisque! (Unbelievable). Then the waiter forgot to add our order of lobster mac n cheese and got our drink orders wrong - very underwhelming service and experience, especially for that price. I would never return.",1
"Very good place to celebrate or just to treat yourself at. Had a very good time. Our server was a little timid/shy, but the food and service overall was great.",4
"Best steakhouse in TO and who wouldn‚Äôt want to dine in a castle? A+
Thank you!",4
Very professional lovely and caring waitresses who are so good at their job. The food was delicious and presented on time .,4
Our waiter was knowledgeable and pleasant. Food and cocktails were delicious‚Ä¶Will definitely come back!,4
"I‚Äôve wanted to try this place for a while but never had a chance. This time we made it.

It was amazing but honestly, not great value for the money. 

We‚Äôre fortunate to be able to afford this kind of experience,  but not everyone is.

We‚Äôll start with the wine.  They have a great selection of wines but they are very elevated. There are still great wines which can fit the restaurant ,
that aren‚Äôt as expensive. We didn‚Äôt need to spend $225 on a bottle of wine. (But that was one of the less expensive ones)

Food wise, while the taste is there and the portions are there,  everything is a la carte which adds up.

We had a great time but dinner cost us $637 after tax and tip.

We‚Äôre used to elevated experiences and they aren‚Äôt nearly that pricey yet carry the same cache.

It was a great experience, but unless you‚Äôre in the 1% it may be hard.",2
"Attentive staff. Helpful wine sommelier. Rib eye steak low quality, full of gristle. Other orders good.",3
The server was polite. The manager was not helpful and quite condescending. The placement of our entrees were accidentally switched  and  her explanation was kurt filled with irritation. We have been there 4 or 5 times and the serving staff normally made our experience memorable. We found  the gentlemen who prepared our side Caesar was friendly and engaged with smiles and chatter. He however was the only support staff making  an effort. We had another support staff snap when we advised him not to take away the menu as we had not looked the entrees. Not sure what was happening but the feel from the staff was not what we remembered it to be. Must say we were dissapointed.,2
Beautiful dinner as always. Delicious food and Justina was fantastic! Always a pleasure to be there for business or pleasure.,4
Our server was really cute :) and food was amazeballs,3
"Nice evening
Nice evening
Nice evening
Nice evening",4
"Beautiful atmosphere, and a place for celebrations and special times. Great service, very attentive and friendly and knowledgeable. 
I find the house wines to be very very expensive. Otherwise, everything was wonderful.",4
"DELICIOUS with terrific service from Dax
A good combo",4
Amazing food!! Can‚Äôt wait to come back here. Beautiful restaurant.,4
Amazing service!,4
"It was our first visit‚Ä¶long overdue especially as we love all Liberty Group restaurants.  It did not disappoint!  The food was excellent but the service was as expected, IMPECCABLE!!! From the moment we entered to exiting the service was bar none!  Our server Gio was WONDERFUL!  He was knowledgeable, accommodating and so hospitable‚Ä¶well done and thank you for making our inaugural (not last!) experience at Blue Blood so wonderful.  If you love a true steak house table side made Ceasar Salad; must try!‚Ä¶ask for Edna‚Ä¶she was fantastic!
Thank you to our hospitality fave man James as well!
Happy Holidays to all and see everyone again soon.",4
Great food great service.. will be returning again.. only complaint was our table for 2. Very tight space.. sat too close to other couple beside us. Chair on outside of booth was constantly bumped. Overall great night,4
Crab was tasteless and the steak wasn‚Äôt cooked properly. Onion rings were like mccain frozen fries - need to do much better for these prices wow,2
Outstanding!!! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü everything is too top notch‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è still dreaming of our meal!! üòãüòã service is on another level!! ü´∂üèªü´∂üèªü´∂üèª,4
Fantastic meal and awesome service that was not rushed at all!,4
Great atmosphere. Great food. Amazing service. A bit pricy but portions are generous. Grilled octopus was absolutely delicious.,4
Food and service was amazing! Raphael made a delicious caesar salad for us!,4
It is the magic place where we celebrated the second time my Birthday. We love the main menu and the desserts are delicious.,4
"The server was not attentive. Usually when you go to a expensive steakhouse, you‚Äôre not only going for the food but the experience and service, considering you‚Äôre spending $300-$400. The server did not menu tour, tell us anything about the drinks or steaks. Took our order and once the food came out, got one of our sides wrong. He didn‚Äôt fix it, the servers assistant did and apologized. Finally asked us about our food halfway through our meal. He asked if we wanted another beer, and we said yes. He forgot about the beer, and as he packed our food, I told him to forget the beer because it‚Äôs been 15 minutes, and he apologized knowing he forgot from the look on his face. Overall the server was not attentive, and seemed like he did not care. Service was very mediocre, it‚Äôs service you would expect to receive at Kelsey‚Äôs or Montanas.",1
We had a wonderful moment. The staff is very warm.,4
"Service was wonderful but the product was outrageous. Paying top dollar at a fancy steak house is fine if the product is top notch. This was not. One steak was over cooked, the fries were undercooked and the prices were through the roof.",1
Great experience overall!,4
"Everything was spectacular, food was amazing, great space, great service! Definitely in my rotation of favourite restaurants!",4
"Such a special evening! BlueBlood is the perfect place to celebrate milestone birthdays, anniversaries or to mark a special life accomplishment or occasion. We recently celebrated my mother's 80th birthday. The food was absolutely delicious. My party enjoyed both steak and seafood options, caesar salad (made for you at the table), mashed potatoes and the mushrooms...and of course, we had to have dessert!! The cheesecake and coconut cream pie were heavenly! Lukas, our server was a true pleasure. He was consistently attuned to detail and making our experience absolutely perfect from beginning to end.  He succeeded. Thank you so much. Can't wait to return!",4
"We took our daughter to Christmas at the Castle for her 3rd birthday then to Blue Blood for dinner after. Overall, food was good and service was excellent. They were very kind and accommodating.",4
An amazing venue and excellent food. Truly an experience.,4
Our dining experience was great . We had a wonderful evening and l cannot compare the venue to anything else. Having dinner in a castle was a treat which can only be described as awesome.,4
"Beautiful property with outstanding cuisine.  Restaurant can be loud on a busy night, but the ambiance makes up for the annoyance of the the noise.",4
Always love the atmosphere and variety of steak,4
"It is  good  place  for  dinner  ,  good  food  and  service  !  will  back  again  !",4
Great place for a group dinner! The wait staff is amazing,4
very good food,4
We had a blast it was so good. We definitely will be back for another big celebration in our life. Thanks for the amazing service and for taking care of us on our anniversary.,4
Its the perfect place to have a nice Christmas get-together with close family and friends.,4
"It was delicious and a beautiful experience. A little too loud and our booth was stained, but the service (Gio) was outstanding, the cocktails were so cool, our tomahawk steak was outstanding. Best oysters ever. I would absolutely return! We came for a 50th birthday, and were given a present, a card, and a birthday dessert. Amazing attention to detail.",4
Too noisy I fund . Amazing cocktail and movktails,1
The food was very expensive‚Ä¶..the chairs not nice to seat‚Ä¶. The waitress always in a hurry‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ to take you out ‚Ä¶. For the price we paid???? Almost 800 hundred dollars‚Ä¶.. we never coming back,2
"The table-side prepared caesar salad was exceptional. The oysters (Salt Point and Irish Point) were somewhat disappointing...not very meaty and not much sea flavour. The steak (bone-in rib) from Wichita, Kansas was good but not great for what you pay. Wine by the glass is overpriced. Our table had 'sofa'-style chairs (L-shaped, high back and high side) which made it difficult to eat if the return of the 'L' is on your right side and you're right handed...get rid of these and provide proper dining chairs. I'll admit, for sipping on an after dinner drink it was quite tempting to want to lay your head down on the top of side of the sofa chair. Worth trying it out for the ambiance, especially during the Christmas season. Overall I'd give it a 7.5 out of 10.",2
As usual it was a great evening with fantastic food.  Gio was absolutely amazing and helpful.,4
Wonderful experience. The staff were grewt and thr food was phenomenal.,4
Fantastic food and service. Highly recommend. Will return here again.,4
"We were a group of 5 that went for dinner at Bluebloods. I have to say not only were the cocktails and food outstanding but the service was beyond impeccable. I really would like to give a shoutout to our server Sergio! He was so kind, explained everything on the menu with great detail and as well as when it came out to our table. If you could personally request servers, I would highly recommend him any day of the week.",4
"Amazing service!
Food was good but expected better.
Main course and sides not hot",3
Always an amazing experience!! Love blue blood!,4
"Good food, better service. Bit expensive but overall good experience!",3
Simply amazing,4
"outstanding service
outstanding food
outstanding ambiance
not too loud",4
"A little pricey, but worth the money. Had the wagyu sampler and was impressed",4
"Everything was spectacular‚Äî food, service, ambience, decor !",4
"Steaks are really good but not the best I‚Äôve ever had. It was good food overall and the right amount to feel satisfied. Service was excellent, dessert were large, good for sharing. Will go back on special occasions!",4
I took my husband for his 40th all i can say was the food was exquisite and the ambiance ....simply MAJESTIC!!,4
"Been wanting to check Bluebloods out for a while and I finally got to do it.  Overall the experience was exactly what I expected.  Service was outstanding, weight staff were very friendly and kept coming to the table to make sure we were completely satisfied.  Table side service is definitely a must.  Definitely not a place if you're on a budget but the overall experience was worth every penny",4
Best restaurant I‚Äôve been to in Toronto!,4
Excellent experience with the family.,4
"Enjoyed this restaurant so much that I‚Äôm returning for a second time. The ambiance, design, service, wine and food were dynamite. Highly recommend.",4
This was my first visit and my guests and I were very happy.  Thanks for the delicious food and great service.,4
"BlueBlood steakhouse over any other restaurants. This food was amazing, the customer service is excellent, the servants have great knowledge in food. Even the people eating at the restaurant are very friendly. Overall great experience :)",4
Sea food tower for two at $160 is a colossal rip off.,2
Loved the entire experience. We had a lovely time.,4
Amazing food and service,4
"Beautiful setting in Casa Loma.

Annoying staff member organizing cutlery which was very noisy and sounded like a cafeteria setting.

Lovely cheese and chive biscuits and whipped butter

Please READ your bill! We ordered 2 Caesar salads ($24 each). Beautiful salad prepared at the table. HOWEVER, when the bill arrived they had charged us $34 per person. Their excuse was the price of lettuce went up that day and they had t revised their menu prices!!!!! After bringing it to their attention, they apologized had the manager review bill and take off the charge. They made it right but we could not help but wonder how many people that night got ripped off on their bill.

Dessert (Apple pie with ice cream) was a large, generous portion.",2
"Amazing place to celebrate, great food and wonderful staff!",4
This dinner was my college graduation dinner. The food was amazing and the service was even better!,4
"The food, ambiance, and staff were top notch at BlueBlood. I cannot wait to visit again. Alex our server was absolutely amazing. Great job to this amazing team or people who work flawlessly together.",4
Sergio was excellent! You get a lot of food for what you pay for. They have great beverage options. Definitely would go again!,4
Absolutely delicious food and amazing decor and ambiance. Staff was exceptional. I would love to go back to BlueBlood again.,4
"First time going to Blueblood. Atmosphere is very nice at the castle. Our server was super friendly and very knowledgeable. Started with oysters and lobster bisque which was fantastic- bisque was very flavourful. For main we shared a steak and has asparagus, whipped potatoes and mushrooms. Everything tasted fabulous and were even three different types of salts to try. For dessert we had cheesecake was which very large but extremely good. We took most of it to go and the put the container in a nice casa lona enviro bag.  The cocktails are very well done too. I had an old fashioned and a Spanish coffee and they were perfect. Overall, a very enjoyable experience. It is pricey but definitely worth it if you are looking for a nice night out.",4
Great ambience and classic steakhouse. Food is average. Better places in the city for a good steak.,2
"Beautiful decor and friendly staff.  Excellent menu.  Can be pricy depending on your choices, but the quality and preparation is worth it.  Will go again soon.",4
Staff and food were exceptional,4
Perfection!!  A special evening to celebrate our son‚Äôs 21st.,4
"We were here to celebrate my sweetie's bday. Gus took care of us, with an assist from Janine the Machine! We've had Janine take care of us in the past and she is awesome. Gus also took very good care of us. Everything was perfect. We will be back!",4
"My wife and I were out on a date, we enjoyed the food and the ambience, the waiters are very knowledgeable about the castle. I would highly recommend for a evening out with you and your partner",4
For such a high end rate restaurant the food was at par. Not what I expected.,2
Anniversary,4
"The steaks were not cooked the way we asked, we had to send them back twice. The manager tried to tell us it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre different cuts‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve been to many steakhouses and know what steak should taste like. They upgraded our steaks and the head chef cooked it himself, which tasted great and we really appreciated the attention. But for such a high priced place every single steak cut on their menu should taste great. As great as our server and chef were, we probably wouldn‚Äôt return.",1
Great food. Love the bar room,4
"all my guests left impressed 
once  again Blueblood nailed it",4
The food was absolutely delicious. Our server was very nice.,4
"A elegant restaurant, good service and food. Good choice of place to have a celebration.",4
"Menu has barely vegetarian options. If you love meat then this place is for you. My chicken was amazing. 

No music üé∂. This would be really nice. 

But the service and food was fantastic. Very pricey so for anniversary and birthdays, it‚Äôs perfect. It is also absolutely beautiful.",3
"Trina main course was superb
Caesar salad prepared next to table was also very good
100 per cent excellent",4
"Incredible service. Top of the line food. Best restaurant in Canada. Not just a ""steakhouse"".",4
"We tried a lot of dishes and these are our overall favourites: 

Apps - Tuna Tartar is a must! Even if you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll like it, trust me you will! 
Main - Wagyu tasting was fun and the Japanese cut was the best steak I‚Äôve ever had. 
Sides - Polenta - seems boring but I promise that you won‚Äôt be disappointed. 
Dessert - Coconut Cream Pie - just the right amount of sweetness and lighter than the alternatives which was exactly what we wanted after a big meal.",4
Friends birthday,4
Very disappointed.  I booked a reservation here for my friend‚Äôs birthday and I was so unimpressed with the five berries they presented to her instead of a slice of cake for her birthday. Could have done a lot better given that this is a ‚Äúrefined and high-end restaurant. Other restaurants would have done way better. I have gone to several high end restaurants and this is lacking. Not worth the hype.,2
"Excellent service and meal!
Quite $$$, not a regular thing, but no regrets!",4
"Amazing experience as always. We got our favourite waiter Gio, he‚Äôs so kind , attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and wine list. Our steaks we done to perfection, the entire night was a hit because of the staff and overall ambiance of BB. We are lifetime patrons!",4
"My wife and I celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary and couldn't be happier with our choice of going to BlueBlood Steakhouse.

We both had the Canadian 12oz centre cut filet. Mine was medium rare, my wife's medium. They were cooked to perfection.

Appetizers, lobster bisque and kale salad we both delicious.

Sides - broccoli, sweet potato fries and garlic mashed. All big enough to share and all were so good!

Desert we shared the largest slice of cheesecake I have ever seen. It was huge!!

Half bottle of wine and a couple Americanos, perfect!

There is no ""dress code"" but everyone was wearing business casual to formal. 

Our server and the other servers were top notch. Took time to explain a few things about the menu, the castle, the grounds. Friendly and professional.

Highly recommended.",4
"The staff at Blueblood as well as the staff at Casa Loma went above and beyond one would expect in terms of customer service. They definitely know what they‚Äôre doing in regards to the hospitality industry. They made us feel welcome, the atmosphere was warm and inviting and the ambience was pleasantly unexpected. The space itself was an incredible mix of old world architecture as well as modern touches. The evening was absolutely wonderful. It is definitely one of my favourite restaurants and place in Toronto. A place that truly deserves to be the spot to celebrate something special. One of a kind gem. My filet minion was cooked to perfection just the way I had requested ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®",4
really loved this place! staff were amazing and very welcoming and helpful and the food was amazing!,4
Epic scenes and wonderful staff - the food was delicious and def worth the visit.,4
"Restaurant setting was outstanding.  Service was amazing and our meal, beginning with the Caesar Salad was very very good.  Terence, our waiter was helpful, informative, very polite and just overall, a nice person.
We will return and will bring friends and family.  An overall great experience.",4
"It was a nice experience to dine in a restaurant that was located in Casa Loma. You can feel the history and contemporary  vibe of the place. The food and ingredients were top notch, however the seafood was a bit small for their price-point, but I understand it was not within their control as many restaurants are struggling to find quality seafood for a good price. I had the castle aged steak and it was wonderful, a nice dry aged taste which i shared. Massive meat portions if you're into that stuff, great staff and service, a bit busy as the night went on and people taking pictures constantly, but that just ads to how lively it is. 4.5/5 would come again for a special occasion.",3
Great experience. Have the table side caesar. Beautiful place and good food but it is very pricey for what it is.,2
"Beautiful location and warm greetings by staff. Lovely ambiance and decor, except window covers do not come all the way down to block the sun shining in the face of guests in the afternoon. Waiter was rushing for the orders. Food quality was ok but pricy in my opinion. Baked Alaska table service was awesome.",3
Food was good ambiance was dead... I think they should make it more lively for such a big place,4
Food is amazing and staff are very accommodating and friendly.,4
My husband‚Äôs 50th birthday. The service and meal was next level. They even had happy birthday made out of chocolate and a candle on the dessert which was a lovely touch. We will definitely be back and highly recommend!,4
Really great!!,4
Excellent food and experience overall,4
"Great food, awesome service!!",4
Great food and service. Quite noisy though but all in all it was a great experience,4
"Stuart was respectful and manner-able host, made us fell welcomed and appreciated. Definitely revisiting is more than likely.",4
"A special anniversary dinner for us, we were put in a bar with a tiny table, service was good at first then when our mains came no sign of server. My wife could not even cut her steak let alone chew it. I had to roam the the dining room searching for the manager who asked if we wanted a desert for a $ 120.00 steak and a ruined evening.
Manager involvement was not what is expected from fine dining.
 Best part is that my complaint to the Liberty group went unanswered , clearly they do not care at $ 500 a couple to salvage their reputation. I should have read the many negative reviews before booking our visit.",0
Amazing night! Food and staff were out of this world!!!! The most perfect and memorable night,4
"Absolutely wonderful service, ambiance and food!!!",4
"Dax is very professional 
Maybe best server ever",4
"It was an amazing experience and will be going back one day ( hopefully soon) 

Apps, steak, scallops and sides were all fantastic 

Service didn‚Äôt drop the ball once, we were vary pleased",4
"The food was good but I hope they can drain the fries a bit it was too oily. The burger was too oily. My salmon was ok though.
It would be nice to have a dress code .
There was a group of people who were too noisy and it is annoying being this is fine dining.
We had a great time though.
It was an experience being it was my first time to bring a visitor to dine at your restaurant.",4
The stuff are very welcoming and our server is very friendly,4
"Everything was perfect from entrance hospitality, seating, service, food and atmosphere. Stunning place. 

Gio hosted us ‚Ä¶. What a nice guy, he was so informative and helpful , he guided us through the menue and all his suggestions were perfect.",4
"Excellent ambient, beautiful location, delicious food and better service. Highly recommended.",4
Food and service was excellent.  Wine we selected was wonderful as well.,4
"We came here for our anniversary dinner, and had Jacob as a server. He was great. The food was delicious. Food came fast and overall a great place to celebrate a special occasion. We will definitely be back.",4
Sister in from NC,4
"The food was super tasty, garlic potatoes were outstanding, amazing cocktails. The service is excellent!",3
"It was a very special dinner for our 25th Anniversary. The only thing I didn‚Äôt appreciate was a table of people who hadn‚Äôt adhered to the dress code and were dressed way too casually for such an upscale setting.  When I go to a high end restaurant like yours, I would expect the standards to reflect that, including how guests should be dressed.",4
"There was plexiglass set up quite unintrusively. It gave me peace of mind and to a certain extent more privacy for our conversations.

We liked our server's recommendation on the 40 oz Aussie tomahawk shared by 5.

Overall good experience.",3
"Absolutely outstanding. We were greeted at the door by several hostesses which was just the start of many great things to come. The service was impeccable and food was delicious.  I would take it easy on the blueblood salad, that is a meal in itself. The steak was cooked to perfection. No room for dessert after but they definitely had great choices. I would definitely go back again ‚ù§Ô∏è",4
Promotion Discount for special occassions like Bdays or Anniversary for the next visit please thanks,4
"Had the 12 oz Waugh steak. It was delicious. Ambience was great, after all its at Casa Loma. The place was crowded, while it wasn‚Äôt quiet, it wasn‚Äôt too loud either. The place is definitely on the pricier side but definitely one of the best steak houses in Toronto.",4
The food isnt worth the price. The waiter had an attitude. If you‚Äôre spending this amount of money. Go to a steakhouse like Jacobs.,1
"Server looked to upsell
Food was pretty bad steaks and deserts were all bad.
Minimum tip was 20%?",2
Outstanding food and service.,4
My wife and I had a terrific evening here. The food was great and the room was awesome. Sergio was our waiter and he was outstanding. We are definitely coming back.,4
Food was absolutely so delicious... and so was the ambiance of the steakhouse.,4
"Maybe best restaurant meal of 2022
Highly recommended",4
"Blueblood was the perfect restaurant to celebrate our anniversary. Our service was exquisite, the food was perfection, and the ambiance made it extra special. I highly recommend and will suggest it to anyone I know visiting.",4
"Everything was absolutely fantastic from drinks to food (salad, steaks and sides) and service!",4
"Pricey but worth it! Delicious food, great ambiance and absolutely outstanding service from start to finish!",4
Birthdays celebration,1
Just amazing. Thank you for such a delicious dinner !!,4
"We had the best night! It was my cousin‚Äôs first time eating at an upscale steakhouse and BlueBloods did not disappoint! Lukas was our server and he was excellent- very attentive and a great personality. The manager, Florent, showed us immaculate care and made the night unforgettable. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a special dining experience.",4
We went here for a friend's 30th birthday and it was lovely and everyone went above and beyond to make it a great evening.,4
Great way to celebrate our 8th wedding anniversary.  Dinner was delicious as was the service. My favorite part?? It's in a Castle!@,4
"So Memorable ~

Over and above the flawless meal and thrilling location, the care and attention we received from the moment we entered to being helped with our coats when leaving was the highlight for us. Never obtrusive - just thoughtful and ever ready to make the evening so special. The service was the best we've enjoyed - from our host especially but extending to every server/staff we had the pleasure of intereacting with. Exceptional!!",4
"Me encanto! Se los recomiendo, todo estuvo delicioso!",3
"I really enjoyed my experience, food was really good, our waiter was extremely nice. Overall my entire experience was amazing",4
It was my parents 50th wedding anniversary and they had their wedding at Casa Loma. From the moment we entered the restaurant the staff made them feel special and the service was excellent. They even gave us a complimentary dessert and they gave them a card and little gift to celebrate. All the food was amazing but the grilled octopus was a little tough. That was the only thing that wasn‚Äôt 5 stars. I would definitely recommend and go back.,4
Our server was amazing and the food was great can‚Äôt wait to come back :),4
"Went for the ambience after a day around Casa Loma. The food wasn‚Äôt overly great for the money but the staff were extremely professional. Once in a lifetime, no need to go back.",3
"Staff are amazing! Very friendly and knowledgeable. Atmosphere... c‚Äômon you‚Äôre in a castle, it‚Äôs stunning. Of course the food is always impeccable every time we come here. We will gladly be back.",4
"Everything about our meal was exceptional; the service, the food, the ambience... and in the unique Casa Loma! Brian H.",4
Everything was great!,4
"Fantastic family dining experience.  Food was exceptional, service was wonderful and very attentive.  Booth space was perfect and lovely decor. We would recommend and return to this restaurant.",4
"Great service, our server was very nice. The gift and special cake for a birthday was a nice touch !",4
It was a phenomenal experience. We were celebrating a birthday and our server treated us like royalty. Outstanding!!!,4
"An outstanding experience 
Thank you Blueblood",4
Everything was great! We will definitely recommend.,4
"Do NOT consider this place as a premium, high quality steak restaurant. It is a tourist trap",1
"Blueblood Steakhouse was a very cool experience. The service was amazing, as was the atmosphere. The food was just okay (aside from the Caesar Salad which was the best I‚Äôve ever had). We had their crab cakes and oysters to start - both were good (not out of this world, but not bad).  I had also gotten the Foie Gras but sent it back - I had never tried it before and it just wasn‚Äôt my thing. We ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese and the Wagyu taster for dinner, along with their Caesar Salad. They make the salad fresh at your table side and it was a very cool production! The Lobster Mac and Cheese was my husband‚Äôs favourite food of the night. The Wagyu Taster was good, but we prefer regular steaks. Overall, great experience and would recommend. The drinks were amazing (and smoked)! The cr√®me br√ªl√©e was average.",3
"Blueblood steak was amazing!

Our server Gio was very nice and made us feel very comfortable! When we come again we are definitely going to recommend him :)",4
Very disappointed.,0
"Amazing experience, our host was kind and food was amazing.",4
"first time here . Great service , good fantastic . nice touches with the smoking shrimps and once upon a time cocktail .   waiter was very very good and helpful . pricy place but worth it for those special occasions .  wife‚Äôs birthday was made extra special ! thank you",4
Very good steakhouse.,4
"Had a wonderful time here with my boyfriend this past Saturday night. We ordered the tuna tartare and octopus for appetizers, the dry age tomahawlk steak and the baked Alaska for dessert. Everything was fantastic, food was delicious, the service on point and the atmosphere was very nice. Great for a date night",4
Nice. Nice,4
It was my girlfriend‚Äôs bday dinner. We had such an amazing time. And the service was on point. The servers were very polite and always checking up on us. I would highly recommend !!,4
excellent food and service. Very nice setup inside and out,4
Best experience! Highly recommended to try at least once. Service by Dejon & Johnathan was phenomenal. Food melted in our mouths! Drinks were amazing too! Would definitely consider going again for a special occasion.,4
Great place to spend with friends and love ones . Costumer service is excellent . We love to come here . Thanks for making so special our evening,4
Lovely setting but did not meet expectations.  Food was good but not up to the prices being charged.   We cook a lot at home and will stay home for a good steak next time.,2
Amazing  experience absolutely loved it,4
"Absolutely phenomenal service and food. I will definitely be returning. The seafood tower, steak and profitable for dessert far exceeded my expectations.",4
"The meats are fantastic. So tender, juicy and full of flavour. The staff is amazing, and the ambience is delightful.",4
"Exquisite ambiance, food and staff.  A really special dining experience.",4
"Came to Blue Blood for a special birthday after hearing many great reviews. This was hands down the best food and service I have experienced. Our server, Sergio, was extremely patient with us as we navigated the vast wine menu, even sending in a sommelier to help choose our bottle. 

The food exceeded our expectations. Very happy with our decision to dine here.",4
Fantastic food and staff. Top quality service. Great wine and cocktail selection. I subtracted a started due being very pricy.,3
They treat younger people like they are a nobody. Service was not the best.,0
"My wife and I loved it and had a great time.  
Service was impeccable.",4
"Anniversary dinner, a little disappointed for all the hype.
Ceaser salad was just ok (too much vinegar), steak and lobster were good. That said, the entire staff was super nice and went out of their way to make us feel special. Can‚Äôt beat the ambiance.",3
Had the best,4
Excellent food and service.  Beautiful atmosphere.,4
"The quality of food, the decor, and the service were excellent. The service provided by Stuart was exceptional; professional, helpful and very friendly. We highly recommend Blue Bloods restaurant.",4
My wife and I celebrated our anniversary at BlueBlood and had a great meal with excellent service from James. Nice touch that we received a small anniversary gift and candles on our desserts!,4
"Food is mediocre, and the server we got was rude. Did not make us feel comfortable with the way he acted and spoke to us. Worst part was, gratuity is a mandatory 20% which he did not deserve AT ALL.",1
Excellent food and service. Would recommend,4
"Had my birthday celebration dinner here with 3 friends. The food was great, but I think the service could‚Äôve been a bit better. Our waiter forgot one of my friend‚Äôs steaks, and when it came down to paying and my friend had asked to split the bill, he came back with just one bill and then said she didn‚Äôt tell him to split the bill, so we just chalked it up to him being a bit forgetful‚Äîno big deal! He also said the lobster Mac and cheese dish was enough for the entire table to share‚Ä¶it was not; I could‚Äôve had that as a SNACK. We had the banana crepes for dessert which came with the flamb√© presentation and it was marvellous. All my friends enjoyed their meals, and the restaurant gifted me a wine cork with ‚ÄúBlueBlood‚Äù on it which was such a nice surprise. Would definitely recommend for a special occasion. :)",4
"The best dining experience we have had together in Toronto. It was my partners birthday and our first time at blue blood. Terence, our server went above and beyond with every aspect of our experience. A massive thank you to terence and all the lovely managers. We cannot wait to come back!",4
"Food and cocktails were excellent as usual ‚Ä¶you can‚Äôt beat the atmosphere but what made the night extra special was the level of attention to detail that the manager, Ashley brings to this establishment‚Ä¶too notch!!! 
Can‚Äôt wait to go back!!",4
"For the restaurant location and menu I would expect the staff to follow all basic etiquette rules, like serving on the left. The mashed potatoes tasted like something I could have gotten in a cafeteria. The cheesecake was good but the steak did not have much flavouring. The shortbread cookie fell off my friends creme brulee when it was placed. It landed on the table and the waiter did not offer to replace it. There was also a lot of fat on my steak. I feel like that should have been trimmed prior to being prepared.",2
"Service was impeccable, as were the drinks. The steak entrees were perfection but the sides left something to be desired. Very bland and flavourless. Really appreciated the waiter talking to us about some of the history of the building and making sure our glasses were never empty.",4
"Hostess at front door was searching for our reservation and appeared irritated and didn‚Äôt communicate/verify only for another hostess to tell us she could show us to our table. 
We were led into the dining room and were offered the table at the entrance‚Ä¶ which quite frankly is perhaps the worst ‚Äòtable‚Äô in the room and should be reserved for people who are ‚Äòwalk-ins‚Äô/don‚Äôt have reservations.
After asking for a change, the hostess seemed apprehensive but a server quickly offered for us to wait and a change could be made.
Fail on the hostesses‚Ä¶. Big thumbs up on the server.
We sat a very nice table by the window and our server David was great!
The overall experience was nice

Thank you
Caterina",2
"Everything was really good, but we found it a bit too loud which made it difficult to hear each other. Maybe the acoustics and/or the tables were too close together, or maybe it was just the area that we were sitting in or just the type of people that were there when we were there making it excessively loud. Either way, it made it difficult to have a normal conversation. Other than that, everything was really good.",3
"On top of being sat 20+ minutes past our reservation, the two chairs in the main lobby could not possibly accommodate the 7 standing in the room. (including myself & my partner) Eventually, after being pushed around by the high speed in-and-out traffic through the narrow lobby, I spent 15 of those minutes outside with my partner in a dress, in the Fall.

Our server was attentive, full of positive energy, and was overall amazing.
However, working in this Industry I can honestly say he was spread thin, and unable to truly maintain constant table service expected with the price tag and the hype.

BlueBlood Steakhouse was not the place to celebrate my birthday (noted in the reservation),which was intended to be a private romantic dinner.
You could imagine being 2 clients seated in the centre of the dining area alongside parties of 15+ clients. I found difficulties placing our order, never mind hearing what my partner was saying.

Not sure if I will be back, and if I do I will certainly make sure it‚Äôs not a weekday or special, private occasion.",2
food was great‚Ä¶. server was a little awkward‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ we should have asked to be in the bigger room,3
Four of us dined on covered patio. Service was exceptional.  Food as good as come to expect here. We shared two large steaks between the four of us which worked out very well - both were excellent but I would give the nod to the Canadian ribeye. My only gripe here is the $15 charge for parking. Bury that cost somewhere in my meal.,4
It was my 3 year anniversary and it didn‚Äôt disappoint,4
Perfect service. Perfect ambience. Great food.,4
"Great food and drinks!  Although no specific vegan options, the sides for vegans are great!  Services was excellent, started with our hostess - we booked the wrong date yet she made sure we got a table!  Our server, Regan was excellent friendly and professional!  Manager was also polite and accommodating.  Our birthday guest received a special surprise from the restaurant, so unexpected.  Thank you for a great evening!",4
"Friend‚Äôs Birthday Event

Oyster, Crab Cakes, Lobster bisque to start with üòã
Lobster Mac and Cheese-so much pieces of lobster
Lobster and shrimp friends ordered üç§ ü¶û
Steak- Wagyu striploin and rib eye 2oz each-deliciousü§§
Desserts was okay
Wine üç∑ was the highlight for me, unfortunately drove so only had one glass

Would go back just for the wine üç∑",3
"Excellent restaurant in one of the most beautiful buildings in Toronto. Our meals from start to finish was exceptional. Sommelier suggested some excellent wines for us to try. My guest from Dublin suggested his NY Strip was the best he ever consumed. (LOL) He was serious!

Definite must go again !!",4
"The service was excellent, the ambience is good but I couldn‚Äôt take a really good picture inside, nothing to post on Instagram. The food is ok, I swear I have had a much much better dinner in other places for much much less money. I don‚Äôt have problem to spend money if everything is going to be amazing but to be honest the food doesn‚Äôt worth what I spend there",3
"We celebrate our 11 year anniversary.  The food, the service.. especially the lady that made our ceasar salad she was outstanding üëå . Our servers was amazing both of them. Due to shift change. We also received a complimentary anniversary gift üéÅ which was so thoughtful and generous. Will go back.",4
Had an amazing time. Lucas,4
"Awesome experience! Great food! The Wagyu is simply amazing!!

Thanks",4
"Everything was excellent from the food, service and venue itself.  Only thing was the table and chairs/sofas.  They were not practical in the Oak Room. We were sinking in our seats making it very uncomfortable for our abdominal which isn‚Äôt ideal while eating a heavy meal.",2
Amazing time at BB celebrating our 1 year wedding anniversary.,4
"The food was delicious,  the staff was friendly. Overall was very impressed",4
Food is Terrible. Not worth it at all. Service also poor for the price. Very chaotic. It‚Äôs just a tourist trap. Don‚Äôt waste your money.,0
"Great service, amazing food, lovely setting.
We had an amazing experience and are very thankful for the service we received, and the lovely gift we received since it was our anniversary. Blueblood you are at another level.

Thank you and see you soon.",4
"The steak was great, everything else (shrimp, mac n cheese, potatoes) tasted subpar. We barely even touched it. The location is breathtaking and the service was amazing. Our dinner time was 10 pm so maybe that‚Äôs why food quality was lacking. Would probably go to Hyde‚Äôs for better food quality and blubloods for ambiance.",2
"Excellent food, service and atmosphere. Well worth the money. Will definitely go back again.",4
"Unfortunately, there were many tiny flies. Everything else was good.",3
Food was good and our waiter mark was amazing. It was a great place for our date,3
"Excellent service from the moment we walked in until we left. Tasty food and drinks, lovely ambiance",4
Amazing!!!,4
My husband and I had an absolute wonderful experience dining at BlueBlood.  If the ambiance isn‚Äôt enough to impress you (it‚Äôs located inside of an actual castle) the food and spirits menu will certainly impress.  Everything was amazing and the service was impeccable. It was our first time visiting Canada and our first time dining in a castle.  This was an experience we‚Äôll never forget!,4
We had an incredible dining experience here! Would highly recommend! The staff was wonderful and the outdoor patio was perfect!,4
"It was a lovely experience, the food was very good. We enjoyed watching the Caesar salad be prepared from scratch at our table as well as the Baked Alaskan. However we did feel a bit invisible. There was an event going on at the same time inside which felt like it took precedence, we were on the terrace. When we received our entr√©es we didn't get asked how we liked it until after it was done. My husband ordered coffee for us along with a baked Alaska. We received the baked Alaska and was hoping to have the coffee to go with it but they forgot our coffees.",3
Everything was flawless with exception to the idea of paid parking. I still don‚Äôt understand why I had to pay to park when I am patronizing your establishment.,3
"This place used to be so great, I took my bf there, spend $500 and we only enjoyed and could eat the Caesar salad really. Good view of you seat outside tho",1
"Service was excellent and the food was amazing. A big shout and thank you to our waiter Alex, and table-side sever, Robbie.

Sitting on the terrace, did not provide the ambiance that we were expecting mainly due to the use of clear plastic chairs and the noise level with a three year olds Birthday party.

The view of the city skyline and sunset was stunning. Overall we enjoyed ourselves.",3
I‚Äôve been here 5 times and I‚Äôm honestly so impressed every single time! The workers are very polite and very accommodating. We were sat at a regular table but it was a bit too small for our liking and they were able to put us in a booth! The food never disappoints and the coconut cream pie is to die for! I highly recommend as a special occasion or a girls night out to a fancy place.,4
"Good food, good service",3
Special way to have celebrated my husband‚Äôs birthday with a great group of friends. And the service made even more special with a thoughtful small gift to mark the occasion,3
"Went here for dinner last night to celebrate our anniversary. The ambiance was very romantic and the interior was gorgeous. A little noisy at one point, it was difficult to speak and hear each other. The food had good portions and was high quality. I had the scallops and risotto. It was cooked to perfection. (No rubbery scallops) Our server was very polite and attentive to our needs. We were even gifted a casa loma cork as a memento which was very thoughtful. It was worth every penny and I'd come back again.",4
It‚Äôs was a once in a lifetime experience. We loved it.,4
2 out of the 3 steaks were medium as opposed to medium rare which made them pretty dry.  The rest of the food was great. Drinks were brought very far in between and seemed to always forget them.,3
"If you‚Äôre a foodie or want to impress, this is the place.",4
"I reserve my comments because the assistant manager did a good job in turning around an upsetting evening. You can read this as, poor service explained, and hopefully the staff in question was talked to and our experience will not be repeated.",1
"My favourite restaurant in Toronto. I‚Äôve been to Blue Blood for my birthday, my loved ones‚Äô birthday. I took my best friend, mon amour, clients and closed friends to Blue Blood. It‚Äôs never disappointed me. The outdoor terrace was stunningly beautiful. The bar area is my favourite hangout place. Amazing decor and ambiance. Service is always excellent. Cocktails are amazing. Food is not bad. The Flaming Alaska is a must order dessert! 

The history of Casa Loma, the brilliant name ‚ÄúBlue Blood‚Äù of the restaurant with three Andy Warhol artwork in the bar room and two large scale commissioned artwork by Mr. Brainwash (Queen Elizabeth II and Singer Prince) in the dining room. The combination of Gothic Revival and Contemporary styles incorporate perfectly in this impeccable venue.",4
Unfortunately this experience was disappointing.  Rating based on the fact that this is an expensive restaurant and that quality should reflect that - 600$ for two people not including alcohol or tip - we actually spent over $800 - some type type of bread rolls and butter were served to the table. It was not to my liking. We had the oysters to start - very small - the bacon mignonette wasnt bad but was underwhelmed with this course. My husband had the lobster bisque which looked good - bowl came with garnishes and soup was poured table-side again not to my liking - too fishy. We had the caesar salad which is $24 and min 2 person order.  It was done table side and the server was engaging and explained the steps.   - it was ok but not worth the $50. - it cane with an anchovy fillet which i havent had before.  My husband had the sea bass  - again too fishy tasting. I had the wagyu sampler $265 for 4 oz of American Australian and Japanese.  - this price point was good for this but honestly the steak was not - the Japanese one was so chewy. - such a disappointment. They had a selection of fancy salts on the table which was nice.   For side we had the creamed corn . - beautifully presented - the creamed corn itself was nice and unique it was garnished with corn nuts and while i appreciated the concept of adding texture - it was a miss.  We also had the gorgonzola gnocchi - nice sized pieces of blue cheese in the dish   -  for dessert we had the coconut cream pie which was nice - not too sweet. The desserts here are very large and more than enough to share. They also made us some specialty coffees with Baileys which was nice.  The service was good / attentive. The ambiance was nice - they also have outdoor ‚Äúpods‚Äù for individual dining which seem like it would be very nice in the evening after dark - i just expect an expensive steakhouse to excel at steaks  and unfortunately ours were a disappointment,2
It was great!,4
"The turfs are overpriced for the quality of food you get, plus you don't get any sides. The caesar salad is good. We had the Rasperry cheesecake and it was phenomenal. The view from the patio is outstanding.",2
"Food was amazing, service was dismal.  For the amount of money you spend at this restaurant, service should be impeccable and it was far from it.",2
"Very good steak and ambience, but very average and less than attentive service for a restaurant in this price range",2
Service was great had terrace reservations too cold on terrace so moved inside and had a great meal .service was great .,4
Had the best steak of my life.  Definitely worth a visit if you are in Toronto.,4
"Took my mom for her 50th.  The Sommelier was amazing.  All of her descriptions and recommendations were spot on and she was very friendly.  Steaks were perfect edge to edge pink, exactly what I was hoping for.  The scallops with squid ink risotto was definitely a highlight, and all the sides were cooked perfectly.  Highly recommend the crab fritters and Gorgonzola gnocchi.   Beautiful atmosphere, amazing food and great service.",4
"Great food and great ambiance. We come here regularly and am never disappointed. However, this time the service took extremely long. 1 hour to get our app. We are never dissatisfied with the service but this was the one time we didn‚Äôt find it up to par.",3
"Una cena incre√≠ble, David nuestro mesero nos atendi√≥ excelente y la comida riqu√≠sima",4
Had an amazing experience coupled with excellent  service and great food!,4
Fantastic vibe. Food was amazing. Very pleased with our experience.,4
"Great experience, great food will definitely go back!",4
"Food was really good but we lacked service for the majority of our meal; had many finished dishes sitting on the table not cleared and no drinks! Another waiter noticed and took over towards the end, he saved the day! He was the type of server you would expect at a place like this.",3
"Beautiful as always! Great wine and food. Casaloma never fails to deliver perfect service and exquisite dining experience.
Will be back each year.",4
"Fantastic, would suggest
Worth the cost for the right occasions",4
"I can‚Äôt think of an occasion more deserving of special treatment than my father‚Äôs 70th birthday.  BlueBlood Steakhouse delivered.
From the gorgeous sheltered seating outside complete with chandeliers, blankets and heat lamps, to the exquisite flavours served up in each dish (we were a larger party, so we had many ‚Äúoh wow, you have to try this‚Äù moments), to our server and sommelier - every detail - was impeccable.  
BlueBloods can absolutely make your special occasions very special indeed.",4
"First time there. Worth it just for the beautiful views and ambiance of the castle. The steak was good (got the 8oz sirloin) but the lobster mac n' cheese and the raspberry, white chocolate cheesecake were to die for! Will have to visit again",4
What a great experience from start to finish. Too many firsts to describe,4
"Steak was too dry, honestly for the price they charge they should hire better chefs!",2
"Our waiter was very sharp and professional.  He was easy going, kind and personable.  When my girlfriend and I go back, hopefully he will be serving us",4
"A truly enjoyable evening. From the food, service and ambiance.  I would definitely go back.",4
"Food and drinks were delicious and service was amazing. Lucas was fantastic, he was attentive and made our dining experience one of the best! We‚Äôll be back again!",4
"Slow service, took 30mins to get a drink .
Poor food quality for the price .",2
Amazing food. Atmosphere was beautiful and unique. Highly recommended it for special occasions.  Worth the price!!!!!!!!,4
"Great service, food and drinks were fantastic",4
Great service,4
"Eating dinner in a castle? Yes please sign me up for the fairy tale fantasy!
Food was good, our server Conner amazing‚Ä¶desert heavenly!
What a fun night out‚Ä¶and the ambiance of a TIFF a party‚Ä¶classic Toronto summer night!
Totally recommend!!!
Bring out your Sunday best and serve hunny‚Ä¶serve!!!",4
"Food was not great.  Brought us the wrong drink(but did comp the drink which was nice).  Appetizers were brought out, but no plates or cutlery on the table.  Short rib ravioli needed salt(no salt or pepper on the table).Food took forever to come out the kitchen.  View from the terrace was beautiful, but not worth the $400 for the mediocre food and long drawn out evening.  In the end we took dessert home as a take away.  We will not be returning.",0
"I‚Äôve been waiting to try this spot for Atleast 3 months while searching for the best steakhouse in Toronto (including ambiance) and let me tell you the honest truth. 

From the moment we pulled up the ambiance, the light on the castles, the valet ( which is only a fair $ more than regular parking) was amazing. Even the host at the front of the gate was awesome

Me and my best friend got seated thinking this would be the best food experience we‚Äôve had (as foodies) 

But tbh, as amazing and 5-star the ambiance and initial impression was. The food was just as bad. Lacking a ton of flavour. The waiter was alright but everytime we asked a question he would direct us to a virtual menu, drinks were super mid, and the meals were overpriced and under-flavoured. 

I really wish I  liked more and could say more but if you‚Äôre just trying to have some over Priced food and really good IG pics this is your spot. 

Ps valet and host service was great. Just terrible food for the price.",1
The location is stunning but I wouldnt rush bck for the food - I have had better steak and sides‚Ä¶. was not anything that blew me away except the bill,2
"The food is fair but priced as if perfect. You can get as good a meal for half the price in many restaurants around town. The view, however, is fabulous,",1
"My striploin is overcook and it does like. $20 steak. Definitely not $80. I am very disappointed at the quality of the steak.

The onion rings are 99% battered so that made it look very huge.",2
The food was so basic but the vibe was amazing.,4
"We will come again. We all loves it.
Great place for kids.",4
"We had a birthday dinner for my husband. And everything was fantastic: starting from the hostess and ambience. Delicious food and good wine list. After the dinner in POD, we moved to the bar and got one of the best mixology experience. Many thanks!!! Definitely, we will come back üëåüèº",4
It was serendipitous that we were there on the evening that the orchestra was in the garden. So delightful!,4
"Perfect place for a special occasions. Took the wifey for our anniversary & it was perfect. We had the pod so it‚Äôs quiet away from everyone. Food was great, we had steak & chicken its pricey but hey anniversary only comes ones a year. Wife loved it!!!",4
"This is our favourite place to celebrate special milestones. The food is always fantastic and the service is impeccable. There was a long wait to get our main course (kitchen was short staffed due to the long weekend is what we were told) but the Maitre D comped our sides and gave my daughter a special gift for her birthday which was very thoughtful. The steaks were fantastic, as always but this time we also tried the famous Caesar salad prepared at our table and the jumbo scallops and we now have new favourite items for when we return.",4
"We had an amazing evening and they went over and above for my husband's birthday.  Would definitely go back.
Only downfall was the chairs activated my ischial bursitis  due to the hard plastic chairs",4
The quality of the steaks is outstanding.  The tenderloin melts in your mouth.  We ordered the mushrooms and whipped garlic mashed potatoes to accompany our meals.  Both were absolutely delicious.  The patio has a lovely view and the service was also very good.  Definitely a must dine in Toronto.  If you haven‚Äôt toured CasaLoma I recommend you make that a part of your visit before your dining reservation.,4
"What a wonderful night, the food was amazing, the space is warm and comfy. Great place to celebrate or just eat really high quality delicious food.",4
Amazing food and service.  Best steak I've ever had!!,4
"Pleasantly surprised ‚Ä¶. Food was better than I expected, service was amazing",4
Food is excellent. Ambiance and location of the restaurant is great.,4
"The service was great, I don't remember the gentleman's name who took care of us but he was so great and walked us through everything so clearly. Tried a few different things but I must say the steak I got was AMAZING! Would go back to try some different things on the menu to maybe find a favourite dish from blue bloods. Great ambience but it was a little noisy, I couldn't really hear when I was speaking. Overall, an amazing place and great first experience. going to be back to take some pictures !",3
"It was one of the best night I‚Äôve had in a restaurant,, I went there for my gf birthday,, the food was delicious, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was perfect",4
Great service.,4
Our service was amazing!,4
"Great service, excellent food, ambience was amazing! Highly recommend!!",4
Good ambience and service. Pricey because you‚Äôre paying a premium for the location & service.,3
"We had a great time last night celebrating our anniversary. However, we would like to comment on our server. He took my husband‚Äôs drink away without asking. It was done but it would have been nice to ask.  He immediately brought us the bill when we said we don‚Äôt need any dessert. We paid half of the bill by a gift card, but the server didn‚Äôt allow us to enter the tips amount. We would have given him a full 20% of the whole bill, but he assumed us to pay less? He took our card and entered 20% of half of the bill that we paid by credit card. Anyway, it ended with this bitter experience, but overall the food was great, other servers were great.",2
"Excellent atmosphere. Brought my father to celebrate his birthday and he had an excellent time. Service was good, the servers were friendly and professional, and kept coming back to check on us. Overall food was delicious. We were told the sauteed spinach was creamy, but it ended up being almost deep fried and dripping with oil. The waiter had that cleared for us right away and took it off our books. Will definitely come back again.",4
"Excellent service, having a special moment in a historic place is just amazing, so tasty, totally recommendable",4
Caesar salad must everyone to try and drinks are great and my favorite is the dessert the coconut cream pie I would recommend it's delicious!,3
"Second visit but I found them not as good this time then before, Lots of bids, mosquito, flies in the dining room. The chairs by the windows are very odd and NOT comfortable. It is as if a side sofa piece out of place and out here....very odd.....NO cockages service....this is bad for a good restaurant as I took along with me a bottle of Chateau Petrus and cannot open here. Certainly will not go back for this single reason. The food is pretty good esp they have some old style dishes like Baked Alaska dessert. Not recommended.",2
"Paid alot and food was just average,  the hot plate that they bring out was not hot at all.  The table side salad making was not good. While mixing oil was splashing on customer.
Alot of the seats sun is shining in your face.",2
Amazing food. Great Ambience. A bit pricy but well worth it.,4
Deber√≠an especificar que para obtener una reserva de una c√°psula hay que tener un consumo m√≠nimo de 1.000 d√≥lares antes de que uno haga la reserva. Es de mal gusto llegar al lugar esperando tener algo y que despu√©s le digan a cliente que la √∫nica forma es pagando ese precio. Estuve de mal genio y la cena con mi novio se da√±√≥ totalmente. No volver√≠a nunca y no los recomiendo,0
"Great experience, music did not work in our dome. Otherwise everything was great!",4
"Perfect dining experience, from ambience to service. The food was amazing. A must have experience.",4
"We ate in the patio pods and the grounds and atmosphere was amazing.  The food was very good, however the service was lacking.  We had to flag someone down to finally bring us wine glasses for our decanted wine and we had to repeatedly ask for our water glasses to be refilled.  If they can work out the service kinks, it could be an incredible place for a special night out.",3
"We were only there at 9:30pm for dessert. Everything was delicious and the service was excellent.  We sat on the outdoor terrace with beautiful view of the castle and the city skyline.
Lovely experience overall!! 
Would definitely plan to return for a special occasion.",4
"Can we be served, without being disrespected? 

I went to this restaurant to celebrate my birthday with two guests.  We were seated by a friendly hostess at 8:30pm, and then everything went downhill from there. 

Admitting it was a busy Monday night, the ambiance was not that warm and inviting. We waited at our table for 30 minutes, trying to get the attention of servers and somolliers milling around serving every other table but ours. My guest finally took it upon herself to leave and ask the hostess if we could at least be served with water. 

Some gracious people at a table to my left asked their waiter to see if he would at least start our drink order seeing they were already on their second round, and that attempt was not made. 

As much as the food is certified to be outstanding, the night was humiliating and embarrassing. It mattered to me that the staff felt that by comping part of our drinks, giving us an appetizer and a cork stopper it would suffice and glaze over the disrespectful chaos that ensued last night.
 
To end this review, a wise woman once told me ""Girl, let this be your first and last.""

That it will be!",0
"The food was delish, staff was very kind and attentive and the symphony Orchestra took my breath away. An incredible experience, I will continue to make this something i look forward to attending.",4
Absolutely gorgeous loved everything about it! Dinner was fabulous!! Everything was delicious!!,4
Truly exceptional. An incredibly immersive culinary experience!,4
"Tuna tartar was wonderful everything else was ""good"". We sat in the patio though so the view was fantastic. Service was pretty good. I would say it's slightly overpriced for the food you get however location makes up for it.",3
"Lovely restaurant in a beautiful location. Food was excellent but the service was somewhat lacking. Our server repeatedly apologised for the slow service. It wasn‚Äôt his fault too many tables for him to serve on his own, he worked non stop. Host on the door could have been happier. Would we go again not sure but we did enjoy the evening despite the hiccups",3
"Wonderful service, great food and a magical ambiance!
BlueBlood is a superb restaurant and our waiter, Alex along with his team made the experience a memorable one!

Cheers!",3
Great quality on ingredients but the appetizers lacked on flavor. I have a suggest. The manager should seat and try to enjoy a dinner on the seats located on the left side besides the wall on the individual coaches it‚Äôs the first time in my life I feel so uncomfortable trying to eat. For many reasons I wouldn‚Äôt dear to call it a full fine dinning experience.,2
"Good environment, nice view and great food!
An option to book the pods online would be great.",4
"Great atmosphere, elegant, beautiful, formal. The service was superb. They were very accomdating, moved us from a sunny spot to shady. In addition they had halal options, which were the Australian Steak Cuts and the
Lamb. Great spot for photos indoor and outdoor. They a Terrance with some views and great landscaping. You can ask to go there and take pics if permitted. The only thing I'd say was that the steak was a little cold. All other hot plates like the gnocchi, asparagus, were hot however the steak lacked the fresh sizzling I wad expecting. Other I would still recommend the restaurant for a romantic or even family event!",3
Amazing early dinner at BlueBlood‚Äôs service was fast and professional. Food held up to the hype. I‚Äôll be back.,4
I had a Wonderful experience this past summer here as always! The only issue I had was the bees flying around while I was eating but that is no fault of the staff. The food was flavourful and the portion sizes were great. The highlight of my date was when the lovely server made the Caesar salad in front of us all. The portion size was very filling as well. My overall experience was great! One of the best steakhouses in the city for sure,4
"Over priced... but food, service and ambience was good.",4
"The food, service and terrace table were outstanding. Unfortunately, the evening turned cooler than my wrap could help and we had to make several requests for a heater (which once lit, malfunctioned and was not shared/positioned between tables properly so that more than just one table could enjoy some heat‚Ä¶our being the table NOT getting any heat).  Eventually our primary waiter brought me a ‚Äúblanket‚Äù which was great.  If you and your table guests are cold, it unfortunately impacts the experience - especially when there were heaters available that could have easily fixed this situation. Otherwise, everything else was very good.",3
Lovely grounds and interior.  Too many flying insects in the inside dining area for this type quality restaurant.  No excuse as small insects flying over your plate is annoying,2
"From the drive up and Valet Parking, adequately priced, to the entrance and serving, you can say it is an Experience. 

The only annoyance is when 3 welcoming Hostesses were busy with customer and the wait was 15 minutes. 

The food was well prepared and you can appreciate the space and larger tables to accommodate the many plates that arrived.

Hope you all enjoy as well,

GMJ",4
"We dine out several times a month. This was our first time, it was simply amazing and worth every $.   Love it excellent service and will definitely go  back,",4
"We had a wonderful evening. The service, the food and the view was excellent!",4
It was my birthday and was not made to feel special for the amount of money we spent . Terrible place for celebration.  All I was given was some berries with a candle.  Awful,2
We were celebrating our anniversary but didn‚Äôt tell them‚Ä¶mentioned it to our server part way through and he surprised us with a gift when we left (Casa Loma wine topper) in a nice box with a hand written card‚Ä¶and when I asked to take my small Gruy√®re puff home (because it was to die for delicious but I didn‚Äôt want to be full) he said he would find me a small container‚Ä¶he came back with a container with 5 more!!  Everyone was friendly and attentive and the food delicious!,4
"Excellent service with a breathtaking view
Excellent food wonderful ambiance",4
"Great atmosphere, appetizers superb, service so great.",3
"We were initially seated on the patio when the rain came down pretty hard, I thought it was odd that they didn't have a better plan for bad weather.  Guests were soaked despite the roof, and it took a long time to get seated indoors though the staff was apologetic.

We tried to get a refund as we purchased separate tickets for the symphony but we were left to figure it out another day as the ticket booth won't give refunds or exchanges.

Our meal overall was good but we did find the Tomahawk Steak disappointing for 50oz.  We expected it to be much larger but perhaps the weight was all in the bone.  Dessert on the other hand was fantastic!",2
Fernando and Jose provided excellent service!  Cocktails and appetizers were outstanding. Couldn‚Äôt stay for dinner. We will return soon.,4
"Blue blood has raised the standard on fine dining.
Well done",4
"Fantastic venue, with great staff, and a tasty menu but pricey for what it is.

The Casa Loma is a wonderful setting for the restaurant. The staff was excellent, knowledgeable, and prompt to take care of us. 

The menu was itself great with excellent cocktails, and savory food. 

My only gripe is WRT to value or price paid versus the whole experience. I think the experience was great, just not at that price.",3
Food and service were top notch!,4
The food was good but they did not realize I was book on the pods but at least we got our pods after have to wait,3
When we book an online reservation it does not completely get to the restaurant correctly. I booked a pod that wasn‚Äôt available and we ended up getting a broken one that didn‚Äôt have lights. It wasn‚Äôt too bad but the lighting would‚Äôve been better. However they were very accommodating getting us the pod. Great experience would definitely recommend,4
"The service from the server as well as the busser was exceptionally amazing. However, the male floor manager was disgustingly rude and had no manner - he literally came to the table and asked ‚Äúwhat happened? What was wrong?‚Äù. The food, especially the steak, was very NASTY! It wasn‚Äôt cooked perfectly, one side of the steak was well done and medium on another side when I asked for medium rare! The chef clearly doesn‚Äôt even know how to cook steaks. The manager didn‚Äôt even care if the steak was cooked properly or not and was just rudely asking ‚Äúwhat happened?‚Äù He didn‚Äôt even introduce himself to everyone at the table, nor apologized the food was terrible. Disgusting food, disgusting management. The manager was below servers or bussers, the manager was definitely worse than the food. Shame!",1
"This place is way overrated and overpriced!!  2 of the steaks we got which were in the 150$ range were not cooked as requested.  One was medium the other medium well. They were both rare.  Waiter messed up on the order.  If a venue is going to chant he this much for food, service must be outstanding and steaks must be cooking to perfection.  Will not go back.  Sure ambiance was great, however, many other restaurants in the city with way better food and service.",3
"We celebrated our Anniversary at Casa Loma, one of the best meals we‚Äôve ever experienced with an incredibly attentive staff!",4
"We came up from Windsor, ON and it was such a wonderful experience. Our server Stuart was awesome and very knowledgeable and made awesome suggestions. Food was amazing and so flavourful. We sat on the terrace and the view was great as well as the ambiance. We will definitely be back.",4
"Absolutely adored the Cesar salad made at the table! Not only was it delicious, but Raphael made it so entertaining! The food was excellent. Perfectly cooked and seasoned, and our waiter made the experience memorable. It was such a great night to go out and celebrate my birthday, definitely coming again, 11/10!",4
"We went to Blue Blood Steakhouse for the first time. It was in a very good location overlooking the CN tower from the gardens. The food was great, however for someone who is very picky they did not have many pasta or chicken dishes. That is the only downside to it. However, I would come back again! The salmon was really GOOD! Our server Andy was very good. He explained everything to us. Came often to check upon us. Answered all our questions that we have had. I do highly recommend Casa Loma and the restaurant for that special occasion.",4
It was an amazing experience. Gio was exceptional waiter!,4
"Beautiful place, so picturesque. There are a lot of people in your space if you eat outside however, taking pictures. This does disturb the experience quite a bit. The prices are absolutely insane, but you are paying for the ambiance. There was a loud wedding in the garden and the noise was a bit hard to handle but we did go on a Friday at 10 pm, I guess this may be normal at this time. 

Unfortunately we had a waiter who really ruined the experience for us. He appeared to be under the influence of something as he was slurring and became agressive when he forgot our order. His behaviour was clearly making everyone in our section feel uncomfortable. It was very awkward, and his angry comments and off-putting energy really made my partner and I upset. He didn‚Äôt check in during the dinner service at all which was fine, as we felt very awkward when he was around us anyway. He made us feel very bad about not wanting to take the up sells he was pushing on us as well, which was definitely not what you want for a special occasion dinner. We brought up the situation to a hostess, who didn‚Äôt take action, or reassure that there would be action. She made us feel pretty guilty for pointing out the waiter was clearly intoxicated, and blamed the poor service on how busy the place was. Other customers in our section looked very uncomfortable as well throughout. This was our first time out at Blue Blood, and the server we had really ruined it for us with his clear intoxication, rude comments and agressive energy. I really don‚Äôt want to mention his name as I worked in the service industry and I genuinely know how hard things are for servers. I just wish a manager would have spoken to him to make sure paying customers feel safe and enjoy their very expensive dinners without being treated poorly.",2
An amazing place for special occasions! Very special!,4
"Very tasty food, cooked to perfection: we had grilled octopus as appetizer and filet mignon wagyu as main course. We ended the dinner with an amazing profiterole. Our server, Ian, was very helpful and attentive and the entire serving team was very attentive. We look forward to return!
Liviu and Ella",4
A very good year!,4
"My girlfriend and I had a great meal and blue blood for our anniversary.  Overall the service and food was outstanding.  Although the restaurant is higher end and has a higher price tag, you are getting exactly what you pay for.  Overall this was a 10/10 meal and an amazing experience",4
Phenomenal place. Great for a special occasion. Outclass food and ambiance,3
"We were in birthday night, service was awesome, our waiters David made our night",4
absolutely amazing experience! Will definitely be going back! Food was absolutely delicious!,4
Beautiful ambience outside. Mushrooms were my favorite.,4
"Unreal experience.  Food was amazing and service was world class.  Executive Chef Sean Bloomley came to check on us and was an absolute gentleman. I cannot say enough about the service, food and overall experience.  Absolutely amazing.",4
Everything was perfect and we couldn't ask for more,4
It was lovely and memorable! I didn‚Äôt get our server‚Äôs name but he was awesome as well as all the other staff. Food was good. We can‚Äôt wait to come back!,4
The servers take good care of you and are very knowledgeable,4
The atmosphere was beautiful. Such a great experience. We went for my husbands birthday and it was also the night of the symphony summer. Was amazing to hear the music same time.,4
"Awesome experience and absolutely royal treatment by the staff. Food was also delicious, far beyond my expectation.",4
All I can say is that everything was absolutely amazing!,4
"We purchased the ‚Äúsymphony in the gardens‚Äù VIP experience. The restaurant portion of the experience was excellent. However the symphony was not what one would expect. It was a ‚Äúrock‚Äù show with a small symphony accompaniment. I did not hear any classical instrument being played, only the overpowering rock band. I like hard rock, but I was expecting a classical music symphony. I could have gone to a bar to see a cover band for what was provided.",3
"I bought VIP which include ticket to the Symphony in the Gardens, dinner, and tour of Casa Loma.  Tour of the Casa Loma was sort of a scam.  Casa Loma staff would not let me in until 5 pm, which is when the restaurant opens. With reservation at 5:30, and symphony starts at 7:30 and ends at 10 pm; this is when Casa Loma also closes.  Dinner will take approximately 2 hours, so where is the time to tour the castle?  I understood this; that's why I came to Casa Loma at 4 pm to tour the castle.  The staffs knew this as well; so this is definitely a scam to get you to pay more (the admission fee again, which was supposed to include with the VIP package.",2
"I was shocked that a place like this would serve me 2 cold steaks. After they were warmed up and I was able to try the meat, I was disappointed at the lack of flavour. I now see why they have so many sauces and different salts to put on your steak. I would never return for the food here. Out of all the high end steak options in Toronto I would rate this food at the bottom of my list. 
The environment amd service was impeccable. The music coming from the wedding on the property was a bit distracting at times.  
Also the host at the door was a bit pretentious tell me that $100 tip will go along way to getting a good seat.",2
Enjoyed the dining experience.  Food presentatuon ans taste were what i expected - good.,4
"Beautiful restaurant. Server forgot a few orders but was very kind overall. Food was delicious and I had a great intimate birthday. The restaurant was kind enough to give me a small birthday card, present and desert. Would definitely come back again.",4
Food and service was amazing,4
"Great food, service and ambiance.  Perfect way t celebrate a special occasion!",4
This was a very special occasion for my girl friend an I. This was only made more amazing.. The ambiance was amazing and the staff was a joy to work with.. I can‚Äôt wait to come again an try other amazing steaks‚Ä¶,4
"Have an amazing anniversary. The atmosphere and the view had me on cloud 9. 
It was magical. Had the best time. 
Will be revisiting again.",4
"So expensive also they charged 20% tip
We protested they reduced it",2
Loved the room and service. Overcooked appetizer (squid) was very disappointing. Average duck fat fries. Jacobs is about 50% of the price and much better food quality.,2
Went for our five year wedding anniversary. It was the perfect place for it! We sat in the outside patio which has an amazing view. The service was superb and the food was delicious. Will definitely be back,4
"Amazing experience, the restaurant and the food couldn‚Äôt be better.",4
"We ate in the outdoor dining pods for my daughter‚Äôs 13th birthday. Gardens and castle are stunning! We tried the tableside caesar which the kids loved. The wagyu steak tasting and sides (broccoli, mushrooms and mashed potatoes were all perfect. Staff are lovely. It was a wonderful first experience and memorable for the kids. We will definitely be back for Halloween or Christmas.",4
Anniversary,4
"The meal was so good. First time we ate there, and for sure we'll come back again for special occasions.",4
Don‚Äôt ask me about what we found in our steak,0
"Booked for wedding celebration, my husband ordered a medium rare steak, but it came as combination of well-done, medium-well and medium. The Caesar salad is very good, and mushed potatoes is good too.",1
"We came for my parents anniversary and I was so pleasantly surprised that my parents absolutely loved the food and service! They are picky eaters, so the fact that they loved everything was great! Our server was AMAZING! His name was Terrence and he was so caring, kind and made my parents feel special! Thanks for making this a great night for my family!",4
"Beautiful location, very good service, ideal for special occasions. Food was just ok, for those prices we were expecting memorable. Caesar salad was very salty, The tuna tartare was good but uninspiring. The steak which we had high hopes for was average not worth the $130 we paid. The best dish we had was the truffle potatos. Lower your expectations for the food and enjoy setting.",3
"The food was great so was the server and service 

Ambiance was Devine, will definitely visit again",4
"Everything was absolutely delightful and delicious. Every plate had thoughtful details, the quality of the food excellent. We will definitely be back for more!",4
"branzino was terrific as was the NY sirloin
dax was also awesome",4
"Travelled from Ireland and was so impressed with everything, from the entrance to the show at the end .",4
"Our server was excellent & answered any questions we had. The food was delicious! We ate outside & despite it raining, we were protected & did not get wet. It was a nice atmosphere & enjoyed eating outside.",4
The steak was so dry that I just packed it. The Spinach was very oily and a little bitter. Seafood tower was good. Octopus was amazing. Definitely not worth the value!,2
"The service was great, the food was poor. We started out with Ceaser salads that were to be prepared at the table, this did not happen and was explained as not having the staff to achieve what was stated on the menu. We then had the main course delivered for a party of three. The sea bass was good, the small filet was an okay cut of meat but not great a little grizzly. The last dish was tuna tartare which looked good. The sides were generous, Mac and cheese, baked potato. We also has a side of brocalini, unfortunately for my friend it bit into the broccoli and a live worm came out. That kinda spoiled the complete dinner. Must say never seen a live worm come crawling out of the food. Pretty sure not returning",0
"amazing experience, food cooked to exact taste...service was amazing!",4
"Great food. Lovely atmosphere. Parking was $15, should have been included when dining. But it was sensational.",4
A magical place. They treat you like royalty. The menu is missing gluten-free and dairy-free options. With the help of our waiter we were able to decide what to order. The chef was so nice he sent parsnip chips for a gluten free entr√©. The view is phenomenal. We will definitely go back but I hope they will add gluten free and dairy free options on their menu,4
The service and steaks were excellent. We sat outside and the view is stunning.,4
"Wonderful atmosphere and attentive service. Food is good but a little overpriced, as expected. Nice option if you‚Äôre celebrating something",4
"David and rest of staff was amazing. He selected our cocktails for us and we were delighted. David‚Äôs knowledge of menu and handling of severe allergies was on point. The shaded patio pod is a comfortable experience, allowing for some privacy.",4
Loved the steak and the service was of course outstanding.,4
Overpriced! Spent over $700 on food and it wasn‚Äôt WORTH IT!!!!,1
"We were well attended to & our server was very pleasant besides welcoming. The ambiance was great other than the fact there was a wedding happening & at times got a bit loud. Food was really good & so were the cocktails. 
Just a point that the service provides scope for improvement for getting maximum star rating if the cutlery, table ware with coasters provided is  laid out professionally in keeping with the classic status of the restaurant. 
Will return for sure.",4
"The service was amazing. The servers were helpful, funny and always made sure we were comfortable. Our food came out to us super quick. Perfect evening",4
"ny aged steak was perfectly cooked 
boston creme best in the city",4
"It was my Birthday, I had a wonderful experience here.",4
"Amazing vibe, great views, good service and ambience. Food? Nothing special. I regret spending $$$ on the most basic preparation of food. My salmon was seared and then put on a plate lol. No sauce, no seasoning, not even salt. And then u have to purchase each side dish. The lobster Mac and cheese, ravioli, steak and mocktail were also extremely basic. I mean it‚Äôs alright if u have a food sensitivity and can‚Äôt take too much flavour I guess. Unless you‚Äôre rich and can afford to spend big bucks on crappy food, or you just love to be in *casaloma* don‚Äôt waste your money there.",2
"Beautiful location makes up for the shortfalls. Service is excellent. 
Misses the mark slightly with the steaks, whether it‚Äôs the cut or temperature and sides overpriced. Overall a very good experience and we will return, but it‚Äôs not our go to.",3
This is a must do when in Toronto.  We had a business dinner here and it was awesome.  Dex was our server and we loved him.  Excellant menu suggestions and prompt courteous service.  The table side Ceaser salad presentation and table side Baked alaskan is a must. Wine selection was great and steak was superb!  Highly recommend!,4
Wonderful meal and the overall experience was incredible.  I would recommend to all and would enjoy returning someday soon. Sergio was a very pleasant young man.  Cheers to him!,4
It was a nice environment to eat and have a good romantic evening,4
It was a wonderful evening! We came to celebrate my friend‚Äôs birthday and then go to the symphony. The experience was everything we expected and more! She enjoyed every moment of it. Our server was amazing! The staff was awesome! The food was TO DIE FOR! The crab fritters were soooo good! This was an excellent experience.,4
Waitier was not helpful would kot come back or recommend it.............................................,0
Everything was fantastic easy access food ambience. Just a bit pricey on basic items. One potato $20 really,4
My favourite place for special occasions.,4
The garden domes need a fan or something as it very hot in sun. Other than that excellent stuff and food.,3
"Great food, great service, did iur 7 year anniversary there",4
The service was amazing from the moment we stepped in the door! And the food was to die for starting from the complimentary fresh bread balls to the wagyu steak to the dessert. A little pricey of course but so worth the delicious food and outstanding service!,4
Amazing place - expect different kind of guests though - upscale and not so much,4
Terrance I believe that‚Äôs was his name he was our server and he was phenomenal. We were celebrating our 27th anniversary and made it very special for us,4
"The indoor server was attentive and catered to our every need - including replacing a dish that didn‚Äôt meet their high standards of perfection. 

For dessert, we requested to be moved to an outdoor location to enjoy a stunning view. Our request was accommodated without question. And while the outdoor server was less inviting than the indoor server, the outstanding view and scrumptious sweets were amazing. 

I should mention that for those who enjoying a post-dinner cappuccino but are lactose intolerant, know that oat or almond milk alternatives aren‚Äôt available.  But, an Americano hits the spot just right. 

So, overall a good experience - good food, great service, & even views. Made all the better by amazing company. ‚ù§Ô∏è",4
Amazing restaurant with great service and food. Our server had great recommendations for ribeye. I would definitely come again.,4
"The location is beautiful and the food was great. The real best part was the service, very knowledgeable staff!",4
"Such a beautiful venue. Great view of the skyline from the terrace, very relaxing. Even the skunk that waddled through the terrace past all the tables for a quick fly by seemed at peace.",4
"I had dinner in one of the pods, the place was beautiful especially for photographs.
Appetizers and side dishes were tasty.  The entrees were not the best I ever had.  I see myself going back but for something lighter.",4
"We had the wagyu beef carpaccio as an appetizer, the tomahawk steak as a main with the mushroom and garlic whipped potato with cognac peppercorn sauce. 

 The carpaccio was amazing. The pickled mustard seeds,  garlic chips and two kind of mushroom was absolutely delicious. Totally worth it. 

The tomahawk steak was perfectly cooked to our liking but thought it was a bit overpriced. It was too big for both of us. We could have only ordered one side but then would be losing in the whole tasting experience. The sides were very good and the cognac peppercorn sauce tied it all up together. 

Would definitely go back. It was a fun exp√©rience. The staff was awesome. Very attentive to our needs. 

Thank you !",4
Really great service provided to us by Andy. Would definitely recommend this place and would definitely come back. Thanks for a great experience/dinner!,4
"My criticism is mainly food related. Two of the three people found the caesar salad soggy. Good dressing but way too much. The carpaccio was very good but the taste was overwhelmed by the bread crumbs. The two steaks were both undercooked. R instead of MR and MR instead of M. The side dishes were pretty good but too rich/heavy. Dessert was very good. 

Finally, didn‚Äôt like having to give credit card number when making reservation.  I understand the reasoning behind it but there has to b a better way of solving that concern. As well, $50 per person if the table is late with only a ten mins grace period is a little much. If you are going to use the table for someone else 15 mins after the reservation doesn‚Äôt show up I feel charging $200 for a table of four is too harsh a penalty. $50 should suffice.",2
Overall the experience was great . The castle is beautiful . Everything was very clean  . No issues at all with the food . Our waiter was the best ! Super friendly and very accommodating . We dined on the terrace and the views were incredible .,4
"Way over priced. I don‚Äôt mind pay for expensive food but the food was not at a level to have nearly a $1,000 bill for 2 adults and 5 kids. It‚Äôs good but nothing special. You are basically paying for the atmosphere, you pay to eat in a castle.",2
"Lovely place to dine in, especially if it is wedding anniversary. The atmosphere, the food the service were all amazing.",4
All we can say fir our Anniversary date it was awesome all around..food was Delicious..everything from the amazing waiter we had to the beautiful outdoor dining experience.. beautiful first time to the castle..and we live in the GTA..lol,4
"ANNIVERSARY DINNER

Fantastic ‚Äî everything was just fantastic. If I could give it 6 stars I would.

Service: The entire team, from the hostess to our server, was phenomenal. I left the anniversary gift with the hostess and it was brought to the table during dessert. We were seated inside, and were immediately brought bread and cocktails soon followed after. Our server was knowledgeable and knew the entire menu like the back of his hand. He made some great recommendations for cocktails and appetizers.

Food: The beef carpaccio and octopus were outstanding. When we were brought our appetizers, they server explained what exactly was on our plate. Our mains? Equally as impressive. We enjoyed the Atlantic salmon, and a wyagu steak burger (I would‚Äôve taken pictures, however we were enjoying the evening so much so we forgot to capture the evidence). They were cooked to perfection and  seasoned beautify. As for our sides, we ordered the asparagus (recommended by our server), as well as the Gorgonzola gnocchi (if you‚Äôre a lover of blue cheese, you must indulge in this.) The sides on their own were decadent. For dessert, we split a cr√®me br√ªl√©e ‚Äî real vanilla bean and some of the freshest fruit I have ever tasted to accompany it.

Drinks: Again, we weren‚Äôt able to take pictures. However, we ordered Mai Tais and they hit the spot. Not overly sweet, and perfectly balanced.

Ambience & noise level: The dining room at BlueBlood is truly a sight to see. Opulent, regal and entrancing are the first few words that come to mind. You really have to experience it yourself. Granted we dined during the week, and I am sure that a Friday or weekend would be a bit louder, but the music was in the background (very important to us. We never had to shout, nor did our server.

Overall: If I could give this restaurant 6 stars, I would. Everything from start to finish was picturesque and made the evening special.

Tiny suggestion: Give yourself some extra time to find parking. Lot is small.",4
"What an incredible restaurant! We celebrated our wedding anniversary and we could not have selected a better place. The ambiance, the service, the view of the Toronto skylight and the food were  amazing. We highly recommend it and we will definitely go back!",4
Our waiter & sommelier were great,3
"One of the best dinners I've ever had and everyone was so friendly and kind to me and my son for his birthday. We will come back!
Time to take down the Covid barriers around the booths though!",4
"The food was underwhelming for the price. The kale salad was dry. The cornish hen was well roasted, but the mushrooms that came with it were somewhat tasteless.",2
Food took alittle long to come out but when it did it was excellent  the was a little under season but the sauce made up for it. The shrimp Asparagus and salad was great we love it atmosphere was beautiful...,4
Good experience and great food. The vibe and ambiance was royal.,3
The people at Casa Loma did not know what‚Äôs Open Table was and they had trouble finding out our reservation. The ‚Äúsymphony‚Äù was terrible! It seemed like a cheap musical number rather than a symphony concert which was what we expected! The location is beautiful but the price is rather high for the event and dinner,1
"The experience from start to finish was flawless, our reservations were held properly and I didn‚Äôt wait to get a table. The atmosphere was stellar and our waiter Terrance was absolutely amazing and made our experience amazing. We were there to celebrate our anniversary and my wife‚Äôs birthday and they were able to make it special with little tokens of there appreciation. The food was absolutely to die for and we both were so stuff in the end we couldn‚Äôt even finish our desserts. I would highly recommend going to blue bloods again and loved my time there.",4
Was a great experience. Everyone was friendly from the start and at the end of the dinner they gave a nice letter and bottle cork with Casa Loma on it to celebrate me and my fianc√©s engagement. We both enjoyed it and the food was all delicious.,4
a table for 2 ... we were placed in the corner in a small room ... we wanted to at least see the grand dining room but did not get a chance. The food was good but the service was terrible ... the server did not clean our table after our main course and we had the seafood tower ... it was served on ice so the table was wet and a little messy ... we mentioned it and the server did nothing so we left without having desert. On the way out the Manager stopped us to ask how our experience was and we mentioned our issues ... he immediately asked us to wait and gave us a gift voucher to either associated restaurant ... he was great with us and sorta saved our evening. We appreciate the Manager for caring!!!,2
"We took in all the food experiences at the table - old fashion, Caesar salad, baked Alaska - excellent",4
Steak was terrible so dry definitely not worth  the money,1
It was a first time experience at BlueBlood for some in our group and they thoroughly enjoyed themselves.  Service was on point and the food was great! Dat in one of the domes for the first time in the garden which was the perfect as it sheltered us from the winds which picked up throughout the evening.  Definitely going back!,4
"Great food and service for our anniversary dinner 
Will definitely be back in the future",4
"Patio in the shade at 6pm, perfect on a hot sunny day.",4
We had a fabulous experience at Blue Blood . Our waiter Terrence was phenomenal. The other staff were attentive and helpful as well. The food was fantastic. Highly recommend to those who can afford it .,4
"Lucas was a great waiter and the food was great, a little on the pricey side but overall very good",4
"After 40 years in business and consistently travelling the world for business and luckily enjoying some of the best restaurants in Asia, Europe and the Americas this one is right up there. Quite shockingly perfect from the magnificent building via the car park attendant to the receptionist to the maitre‚Äôd to the waiter the service was simply impeccable and unintrusive. The food was of course perfection the ceaser salad made at the table side, the steak and oh my goodness the cheesecake. But this is a must if you are in Toronto - it is simply exceptional.",4
Truly amazing food and the waiter was very nice. Will be back.,4
Food was amazing!  Best steak I‚Äôve had in a long time. We will definitely be back.,4
"Outstanding restaurant from the service to the food .
This steakhouse  is a must if you come to Toronto area , and it deserve a 10 star thanks to the lovely staff Samuel and Dax Thumbs up .",4
Extraordinary! Both the service and food were exceptionally good. Place has a great ambience. Great experience for couples as well families and business gatherings. Highly recommended!,4
Definitely the best place to go to if you want amazing food with amazing service,4
"While food was good, pricing is unnecessarily steep as you can get equally delicious steaks at a number of top notch Steak Houses in Toronto. Our waiter was lovely and the sides were very good. You really go for the Casa Loma experience.",2
"Wonderful first time experience - we had the short rib ravioli, grilled octopus and wagyu shared platter which phenomenal, highly recommended!",4
Not worth the splurge at all. Food quality was poor.,2
"Everything was so nice and so good. From the table side made food to the various steaks. 

Everything is a la carte and shareable",4
Service was impeccable! All staff were friendly and professional. Food was delicious.,4
"So dinner in a beautiful almost 100 year old castle - what is not to like? Undercooked food (crab fritters still had raw batter in the center), lobster bisque that tasted like bouillabaisse (do the chefs know what they are supposed to be making?) orders not cooked to requested temp, under seasoned dishes etc. Service was very slow and the waiter warned us and apologized repeatedly but at these prices you would think they can hire and retain decent kitchen staff but I guess not.  Will say that the steaks we ordered - the meat was excellent- but at $230 and $220 I would not expect less.  Not sure how long COVID can continue to be the excuse for failing on all other levels.",1
We came here for the Symphony in the Gardens experience and it was perfect from start to finish.   Every morsel was tasty and portions were beyond expectations.  Can‚Äôt wait to come back for future occasions!,4
"Our server, Terence was wonderful. Ambience was perfect.",4
"We had a table on the terrace, was an absolutely beautiful evening, our server Terrance was excellent, he made the evening a wonderful experience.  Food was delish, we started with Oysters from PEI, Caprese salad and the sampler Wagu beef.  Just the right amount of food for two people.  We had the cheesecake for dessert, home made on site which absolutely melted in our mouths.  We even had enough to take home.  Will definately be back.",3
"Service was absolutely outstanding and food was delicious 
A great ambiance and evening out",4
Espectacular üòçüòçüòç,4
Gio was my server at Blueblood. He provided excellent service and made the experience that much greater. Food and drinks were amazing and the ambience was awesome. Would recommend going for special occasions.,4
Steak wasn‚Äôt very good but the castle was very cool. i expected it to be good due to the prices of the restaurant but it was super underwhelming. I went for my birthday spent over 600 and they gave me 5 raspberry‚Äôs with a candle in the middle of them. Very anticlimactic. Definitely would plan a party here. Wouldn‚Äôt come back for the restaurant. Server also probably only came over 5 times.,1
"Amazing atmosphere, food, and service! The people who work here make sure you are having a wonderful dining experience.",4
Didn‚Äôt get service for almost 30 mins after being seated and server was rude!,2
"Brought my girlfriend here for her birthday. Drinks were good but overpriced, food was good, but not the best I‚Äôve had. Very pricey for the food that we received.",3
"Great food and a wonderful server!
Will go back many times",4
Our experience was exquisite ‚ù§Ô∏è,4
"My husband and I had dinner here this evening along with another friend. It was our fourth time at this restaurant but my friend's first time. We were celebrating my 50th birthday. Overall, we would say that the meal was‚Ä¶ OK. We were seated outside on the back patio which is really lovely, with a beautiful view of the Toronto skyline. Compared to the other three times we've been here (the last time was almost exactly one year ago), we felt like the service was just not quite as attentive/""on point"" as it has been in the past. We wondered if this venue was suffering from the same staffing shortages as many other restaurants because of the pandemic. In terms of the food, the tableside Caesar salad and chopped salad were excellent. When it came time for the main course (steaks and 3 sides), the steaks came out room temperature. We immediately identified the problem and they were sent back, along with all the sides, and remade for us. At a restaurant of this caliber, the food should not come out lukewarm. It should come out piping hot. Despite this problem, no manager came over to apologize, nor did we get much of an apology from our server, which surprised us. When the new steaks were brought out, my friend's steak was slightly undercooked (medium, not medium-well). She did not send it back a second time. We also had to ask our server to bring us the little starter cheese buns, which should have been brought automatically without asking. We shared two desserts, the baked Alaska and the cheesecake, which were both excellent. Overall, we felt like this experience dropped the ball a bit‚Ä¶So it was still good, but not outstanding.",3
The entire experience was excellent. Service was above and beyond. The courses were all fantastic.,4
Best birthday experience ever! It‚Äôs expensive but worth it. Had the Wagyu and will definitely be back.,4
"Atmosphere: It was on our list for so long and we finally went there for my boyfriend's birthday and must say that the atmosphere was very romantic. I provided them with LOTS of instructions on OpenTable and a call and they kindly provided all the requests.

Service: The people who were serving the tables and drinks were terrific. The lady who guided us to our table was not welcoming and did not respond to our questions or comments. 

Food: Here is what we got:
- complementary bread, (simply WOW!)
- big eye tuna tartare, (it was fantastic)
- grilled jumbo asparagus, (perfect combination with the steaks)
- duck fat hand-cut Kennebec fries, (did not like it as the cuts were somehow too big and some ended up just fatty and not delightfully cooked)
- Wagyu filet tasting, 
- creme brulee,
- all paired with a fantastic bottle of a rich, full-bodied, Spanish wine",3
"Ordered the steak tartare and tuna tartare, both are my favorites off the appetizer list. I tried the rack of lamb this time and it was the best lamb I've had. It was perfectly cooked medium rare and so tender and the bits of fat just melted in your mouth.

Our waiter was also amazing, what a show man, entertaining, friendly, and always attentive. We sat outside on the terrace and the view of Toronto just set the ambience for a beautiful summer evening of al fresco dining.",4
"Service was amazing our server Kelly made the night amazing. But the food was disappointing we ordered the grilled octopus which was dry and over cooked, bone in ribeye steak which I ordered medium rare but was more medium to medium well, scallops over risotto which were definitely not fresh very fishy in smell and taste, and then the biggest disappointment of the night the lobster mac and cheese that was dry not cheesy and there was 2 pieces of dry rubbery lobster. For a $500 meal for 2 this was beyond disappointing since the best tasting thing was the free cheese bread at the beginning of the meal I‚Äôll never be returning here or recommending it.",2
"The service was impeccable, but the food was not what I was expecting. I found most of it pretty bland & flavourless. It was fun being inside Casa Loma, of course, but I did expect to be more wowed by the food. The best part of the meal was the bread at the beginning!",2
"Amazing service, our server was very attentive and friendly..
Enchanting location!",4
"What a view!  Dining on the terrace of Casa Loma with Connor as our server was truly a pleasure. The view of Toronto was amazing. We are not steak people. Connor recommended the rack of lamb and the sea bass. Both were perfectly prepared. We also had the duck fat fried and the broccolini. Both were very good, but those fries were among the best I have ever eaten. After dinner, Connor was kind enough to offer to take our photo with the view of the skyline behind us.  It was a perfect way to end a perfect day.",4
Overall good experience but It‚Äôs a bit overpriced! We were 3 adults and a kid no starter and just 1 deser ended up 500$ but I might come back. Servers were really good!,3
Great night had by all! Food was exceptional and the serviers were very attentive.  Definitely going back.,4
Perfect for a special night out! Very pricey but so worth it if you are celebrating something special! Would go back for sure,4
"Found the food to be ok but not great. I think for the prices you are charging the food should be outstanding. Bisque was overly fishy and not silky as it should be. Sesame ahi was pretty flavorless and not seared plus served with jarred pickled ginger. Should have been a lot better. Overall was ok but not worth the prices. Btw, I am a retired executive chef from Vancouver so am a bit picky",2
"It was our first time and we absolutely loved it. It did take some time for our main courses to come but we understand it was a very busy night, on top of the rain. Everyone was very accommodating and generous, definitely going back soon!",4
"The server was great, she definitely went above and beyond to make sure we had a great night. The vibe was nice. The food was just okay.",2
"The waiters  were amazing.  They accommodate us to go from inside to outdoor seating. The waiter costa was friendly and make the first take experience at the restaurant wonderful. However we were there for 3.5 hours. Service was super slow. It was just myself and my husband. Costa had mentioned the the restaurant was short staff. But OMG it was 1 hour too long. 

As for food. The Caesar salad was tasteless. We didn‚Äôt even touch it. The seafood tower for one person for $80 was way over priced. What you add to that ice for us to consume for one person is ridiculous. Also the crab leg was overcooked.  

Yes your steak was fantastic! I‚Äôm so grateful for that. But our sides of onion ring and broccolini or disappointing for such a fine restaurant. The onion rings were fast food quality. No home made taste to this. And the Brookolini tasted way too chard.  

Obviously the view was fantastic. I was grateful for the good weather. It was my 49th birthday and I was thankful for the candle brought out by the waiter.  

Not sure I would go back. if I did, I know how to order and also explain that we‚Äôd only have a 2 1/2 hour limit.",4
Good food & service,4
"Fantastic! Had a lovely conversation with the manager Mike at the end of the day as well. The food was delicious, the staff Fantastic.  Food was unreal. It‚Äôs a must for any occasion!",4
"This place was a good experience. Food was overly priced BUT tasted amazing. The downside of the food to me personally was that for paying over $100 for a small well cooked steak SHOULD be garnished with SOMETHING. The presentation of that for the price is absolutely not good. 
Other than that service was good, food was served timely. I also think more acknowledgment should go towards serving guests more special when it‚Äôs a special occasion especially for couples celebrating a wedding anniversary (other places usually ask if you are celebrating anything) I just think that would be a kind gesture instead of having to say so yourself for these kinds of prices‚Ä¶.",3
"This was one of the most memorable dinner events we have had in MANY years! WOW!  Not only was the food amazing, our waiter (Gio?) was outstanding. We had one of the private pods outside and it was intimate and fun. Next time we will book the terrace overlooking Toronto! Loved everything üòä",4
Perfect. We'll be back. Service was excellent. Terrence and staff were above and beyond. Made us feel special as if we owned the place.,4
The food and ambiance were incredible. You can‚Äôt compare this to any other steakhouse in toronto. Don‚Äôt wait just run to this meal!,4
"The food was not very good. This was not a fine-dining experience. Sorry to say, was not good and will not return.",0
"Felt the service was personalized given it was our 50th Anniversary. Very attentive staff without feeling bothered. Food was superb. Lobster Bisque was great. Banana crepes were fun and tasty. Australian Wagyu was delicious. Stewart, our main waiter was terrific. Manager came with good wishes, a card and a nice memento.",4
The service at the outdoor bar was impeccable. Simply divine food. Cannot wait to go back!,4
Fantastic dinner. Great service and ambiance,4
We all had a wonderful time and a great experience!,4
Delicious dishes. Steak was perfectly cooked to our liking and the ceasar salad made fresh at the tableside was so good . Excellent staff! We were assisted by multiple people and each was friendly and helpful.,3
I think the pods are a neat idea and probably great for ultimate privacy and when it rains. But if you are looking for views do not do the pods. I would suggest the terrace for sure! Food was great though.,3
"Amazing food, wine and service!",4
"Excellent bar manager, Adam, who prepared very creative drinks. We spend a long time at the bar because the menu selection was so good. Second time celebrating our anniversary here and food and service was very good. We ate so much that we didn‚Äôt have room for dessert this time, but menu overall is great. Particular favourites: foies gras, wagyu tasting, lobster tails, mushroom side, gnocchi with Gorgonzola side. Faust wine - felt like silk in the mouth with a clean full body and smooth finish.",4
Excellent food. Great cocktails. Beautiful ambiance. Excellent service. Super expensive but it was the best food I‚Äôve ever had.,4
"Samuel, Trevor and Kali were phenomenal. From the hosting to the service, We‚Äôve had the best time ever on the patio enjoying this beautiful view.",4
Fantastic service and ambience. Delicious food. Highly recommend:),4
"Setting is lovely
Menu and food uninspired
Steak perfectly cooked but iunimpressive: no salt or spice‚Ä¶.  Not charred on outside
Duck fat fries tasteless.",2
"Classy food with flair, in a serene setting.   Our server Connor was entertaining and attentive; we even received a personal tour of some of the castle with him.  it was a memorable experience for a birthday.",4
"Beautiful restaurant, especially the patio, the food was ok, way overpriced compare to other fancy restaurants in Toronto. Service was ok, maybe we were unlucky with the waiter and at the end were charged twice for the seafood tower, we ordered only one, lucky we caught it on the bill and it was adjusted. Be also prepared to pay for parking, most restaurants waive the fee if you dine, Casa Loma doesn't.
One time experience for me, you can get a better value for your money elsewhere.",3
"Our server Conner made the evening just absolutely perfect. 
We were celebrating a 60th birthday and I am so glad we chose this place. So worth it as the food was delicious and portions were perfect. Then the service from Conner topped it off perfectly. Best night - all 6 of us agree.",4
Very knowledgeable staff and extremely helpful. Jacque was a great help and possess a wealth of knowledge on wines and single malts.,4
"This was our first visit to Blue Blood and I have to say we were very disappointed with our experience. Our server was Gio. He was not very attentive at all. He didn‚Äôt come to our table after our food arrived to check on us. We had another server come over to clear our plates eventually and ask if we wanted dessert and brought the menu over. Gio took our order but came back 10 mins later asking what we had ordered as he forgot. Again someone else came by and packed up our leftover cheesecake and Gio came by refilling our water several times, not once asking if we wanted our bill. Just not the type of service you expect at such a restaurant especially when you are spending over $500 on a meal. I‚Äôve had much better service from other steakhouses and I‚Äôm just extremely disappointed as we were both really looking forward to tonight.",1
"Beautiful location... but the annoying and completely useless ""covid"" barriers , that are wide open anyway, really ruined the ambiance.

Steak was pretty good, portions of mashed potatoes and other sides were surprisingly small.    There was no access to see Casa Loma afterwards, though this was never promised- so no big deal.

Beautiful place to bring a date, but please..PLEASE get rid of those hideous and completely useless plastic shields around the tables.  Airborne viruses are suspended as areosols anyway.   Life goes on.  Covid is here to stay.  Let's stop with the useless gestures.",2
The server Justina was extremely good in reading our mind and proactively offer to take pictures for us. Impressed by her  care and attentiveness‚Ä¶ thumbs up for this server!,4
"Amazing service from Stuart/Stewart! Extremely warm, welcoming, and very knowledgeable about the history of Casa Loma. Food is definitely on the pricier side but nonetheless good.",3
"The service and food was very poor. 
My fianc√© and I visit blueblood once a month at least and the service is always great. Not sure what happened this weekend but the food and the service was very bad. We were served burnt steak and told by the server that the steak is supposed to be like that. Re-ordered medium well and got served medium rare.",0
This is the perfect spot for a date night. The ambience is on point. The view is amazing. Service is next level and the food is so good!,4
The restaurant is fabulous and the service was amazing.  Thank you.,4
Great evening with friends. Sat out on the patio would totally  recommend,4
Great food and top class service - had a great time visiting the castle and having a meal fit for a wedding anniversary celebration.,4
"One of the best restaurants/service I‚Äôve ever experienced. The Wagyu melts in your mouth. Conner was our host, and he was fantastic.",4
"We had Moza as our server tonight, and she was incredible! Attentive, appreciative and just such a positive energy! Made our night!",4
It was a cancer remission celebration and was annonced in the reservation. The staff never aknowledged this. The steak was excellent but the sides were horrible. Staff was cold not at all welcoming and for a price of 500$ and more I was certainly not expecting this. I don‚Äôt recommend blue blood anymore. Really sad !,2
"‚ÄúValue‚Äù is a relative term, but seeing as this is my 4th time here, ‚Äúquite expensive but worth the experience‚Äù is my interpretation! Our server Isaac was delightful and pleasant. My girlfriend and I went straight for the Japanese A5 Wagyu, having tried the Wagyu sampler on our previous trip. It was to die for! Every bite melted in your mouth, such savoury goodness. The spinach dish was perfectly crisped on the surface, and we rounded things off with Once Upon A Time old-fashioned‚Äôs and espresso martinis.",4
"Lovely terrace, good menu, wine pairing recommendations were on point. Good variety in menu. Appetizers and dessert were very good. Main course was disappointing, given it is a steakhouse and pricey enough. Steaks were served slightly more done and the meat was not as high quality as I expected. The sides (broccoli and mushrooms) were ordinary. Service started out excellently, but as time wore on and they became busier, it became slower and unremarkable. Glad we ate there once but unlikely to return",2
Great steak house one of my favourite,4
"Celebrated our 20th anniversary.  Great experience. Staff was all very friendly. Each dish brought out different person.  But all work as one.  GIO our waiter was funny, uplifting and overall amazing.  Definitely recommend BlueBlood.  Yes upscale and $$$$ but you got to live once in a while.  Give star plus.  Every morsel was well presented and prepared.  Table side salad and dessert amazing.  Cheers",4
Excellent service! The food was good and we loved the place! The attention was great!,4
Always a perfect dinner.  Staff is professional and friendly.  Food is on point.,4
A wonderful experience. Incredible service.  Delicious food. Super knowledgeable staff.  Highly recommend!,3
"Great time, food is pricey though.",4
"We stayed in the outdoor bubble pods, they were beautiful. The service was exceptional. However, my steak was not. This was disappointing as my last experience was wonderful. Perhaps an off day. Dropping 120$ on a steak I expect a good cut, but the ribeye was rubbery. The rest of the food was delicious. Highly recommend the short rib ravioli. Andrew made the best ceasar salad and banana foster.",2
"Ordered the Wagyu steak, was cooked to perfection it was exactly what I asked for. The ambiance was great nice restaurant to celebrate an occassion. Price matches the destination and quality of food lol
Would definitely return!",4
Very lovely place but for the price I expected more. The views from the terrace are amazing and great for pictures. Highly recommend this place,3
"Lovely ambience and perfect atmosphere at the sunset hour. Dax (our server) was wonderful and very charming. Food was cooked to perfection - however we underestimated the size of a 16 oz. ribeye and could not even finish our sides. At least got to take it home! The only thing detracting from the experience, though not major, was the overlapping party/wedding music that seemed to be playing from another room - it was odd to hear 90's era hip hop in a historical setting. A great place to splurge and opportunity to enjoy fine dining.",4
"pods were very hot, not shade from the sun",2
Definitely coming back next month Sergio was amazing I would like him as my server next üíô,4
"Connor R and Jacques made our anniversary dinner an unforgettable evening. Their menu and wine recommendations did not disappoint. The overall experience was exceptional, we cannot wait to return!",4
The food was amazing and they have a large selection of international wines. They had a sommelier that recommended a great wine that we really enjoyed. The service was friendly and welcoming from the moment we walked in. Would definitely come back here again!,4
"We celebrated my birthday 
It is not our first time eating at Blueblood and we usually love it there, unfortunately last night we ordered lobster bisque and we absolutely didn‚Äôt like it, for such a pricey dish, it was not eatable, we left it on the table and told our waiter that we didn‚Äôt like it, he said I am sorry to hear and returned it to the kitchen.
Only this morning I realized that they charged us for the soup, truly I was surprised and very disappointed!

Besides that the rest of dinner was delicious, the ambience is wonderful, and the service was fantastic!",3
"The food was incredible, the service was even better.  I can't remember our waiters name but he was super knowledgeable and not pushy at all.   Very nice experience.   We will be back",4
Our waiter was simply wonderful and the food was very nice:),4
"It‚Äôs an exceptional place, although the lobster and the octopus were over cooked which made them rubbery, The best thing was the fries and the wagu prime steak, lobster bisque was very watery, but the staff was quite incredible.  Perfect place to take a date",2
"Went there for my wife and I's birthdays (we have the same birthday). Our server was outstanding. The outdoor pods are cute and private but the setup seemed a bit too casual for a high end steakhouse. The food was good, but not very memorable. Overall it was a good experience though. It was very ""instagramable"".",3
Great experience,4
Service was amazing. Food was okay and not worth the mark up. Ambience was outstanding.,3
Outstanding service and food. The ambience is just perfect. Highly recommend üòÅ,4
"We sat in the dome. It was simply gorgeous. We loved every bit of it. Our steak was overcooked from one side of the bone and correctly cooked on the other.  That being said, when we informed our server Vito he immediately informed the manager (Samuel). 
They made things right for us. Both Vito and Samuel were amazing.",4
Had an amazing time at BlueBlood. Food is incredible and the outdoor patio this time of year is stunning. Incredible view of the castle and the downtown skyline. Highly recommend this restaurant to anybody who hasn‚Äôt been yet.,4
Went to celebrate a graduation and BlueBlood did not disappoint.  It was a memorable experience from the food to the service.  The Tomahawk and Australian wagyu striploin were great choices and cooked to perfection.  The coconut cream pie was absolutely delicious. Definitely going back!,4
"We went to Blue Bloods for my graduation dinner and it was spectacular! The food was amazing, the portions were so filling, and our server was the best.  10/10 would recommend",4
"Excellent experience. 
Food, view, hosts were so good.
Definently  will be back.
Thank you for everything.",4
Dax was the best server and super knowledgeable about the menu and our selections. He made amazing suggestions on what to order and we loved everything.  My requests to accommodate both my husband's birthday and also to remedy my feelings chilled with a warm blanket were met swiftly and kindly by staff. And my husband and I agree it was the absolute best meal we have ever had.,4
"Beautiful from start to finish! The views, the service and the food were all amazing. Highly recommend!!!",4
"10/10. gio was great and knowledgeable about the menu. Wichita Kansas steak SLAPPED. SENSATIONAL lobster mac and cheese. EXCELLENT gravlax. wine was EXQUISITE. asparagus with hollandaise was DELICIOUS and the Apple pie was alright but the ice cream that came with it...MY GOD!!!!

Oak room was beautiful.",4
"Terrance the waiter was great! There was a hair in my drink, however Terrance apologized and got me a new drink immediately. Overall my experience was great and no complaints however the music and the noise level was too loud.",4
"Perfectly cooked Tenderloins, amazing sides!!!  This place is pricey, but worth it!  If the weather is good, I recommend the terrace, it's beautiful back there!",4
"My husband got promoted and I choose the blue blood steakhouse to celebrate. Over all experience is ok but we felt so rushed to finish and leave!!! When you pay $550 for for two ppl dinner 3 course meal, you should not feel rushed that way.",3
I enjoyed the food. I wish we got a better area to sit. I had my 2 year old with me and it wasn‚Äôt very quiet. The servers there had a prep behind us at the back. They should‚Äôve done that away from customers view or before we got seated.,3
"One of the worst dining experiences I‚Äôve ever had. I would never recommend this place and contemplating asking for a refund on the night.


The food:

Had no flavour and most dishes lacked simple seasoning. The octopus we had was over cooked, the jumbo prawns were water logged and lacking any flavour (cocktail sauce was incredibly sweet), Cesar salad that is made table side was over priced while being made in beaten down plate ware and with low quality ingredients having tasted better ones at an east side Mario‚Äôs. We also got the carpaccio and steak tartar that looked nice but would be  nothing I‚Äôd get again. 

Best part was after spending 300$ on apps only didn‚Äôt even want to buy a steak let alone any other item and was willing to spend over 1000$ for a birthday dinner. We got a glass of wine and an espresso martini, one of which came with a fly in it and the other was curdled.

From the uncomfortable seating that has you crumpled over while you eat to a server who seemed to be tweaking out because he couldn‚Äôt be still while having no recommendations on anything, to the paper menus that come dirty and paired with a digital cocktail menu on a tablet that is leather bound, fraying, and so out of place we almost walked out as soon as we sat down. 

For a steakhouse that prides itself on being upscale, high quality and great service I can tell you that the keg is a better experience. It was my birthday I was celebrating and they were kind enough to give me a cheap wine top with their logo on it to remind me to never go again. Oh and it came with a candle in 6 raspberries. The keg gives you a whole dessert and their bread is better. 

If management wants to reach please do, I myself work in hospitality and have been for over 15 years at all levels. I‚Äôve never been more disappointed in an experience let alone in food quality. 

If you want a place that looks nice so you can take great pictures but spend money on nothing Bluebloods is your place.",0
Our server was fabulous and so friendly! He was so particular and concerned about our dietary restrictions and made our special night even better! 5/5,4
"Our second time there and celebrated our Anniversary there this time. The staff, ambiance, and the food was top notch. I little heavy on the the pocket book,  but that is what you get for that type of experience.",4
Best steak house in the city ! Not only are you getting the best quality in food but you are also getting the best service period !!,4
The atmosphere Casa loma was breathtaking and the view and the ambiance made for a beautiful dinner for me and my honey. The service was great and I would highly recommend,3
Sides came 15 minutes after the steaks. Not ideal. And it was not busy.,3
"Great experience for our anniversary! 
Staff were super friendly and even gave us a little souvenir with a cute card! The food was great too and we were able to sit in the pods outside which I highly recommend!",4
"Went here for my birthday and the service was very attentive! They even gave me a little birthday card, which I thought was sweet.  The food is definitely delicious but it is pricey as a matter of course.",4
They were so nice! My waitress was also super nice. I went in honour of my graduation celebration and they even gave me a little gift and a card <3 10/10 recommended,4
"BlueBlood Steakhouse is a great place. Very quiet and beautiful. The service is 100% perfect for me, my husband love it üëèüèæüëèüèæ",4
Food and service was exceptional,4
Very special,4
Amazing view from the balcony ! Delicious food and great time! Definitely will come back !,4
Trevor was fantastic and the whole team really took care of our every need. Followed by the symphony on the garden - what a beautiful experience,4
"Very unique and enjoyable experience, fine dining at Casa Loma. The atmosphere was perfect, the service very good, and the food was spectacular.",4
Great selection of steaks and sides were amazing. I recommend the table side salad! One the best salads I‚Äôve ever had. If you sit on the terrace make sure to bring a coat.,3
"Beautiful ambience and attentive customer service! I went to celebrate my parent‚Äôs wedding anniversary and the staff went above and beyond to ensure we had a special experience. They were friendly, attentive, and our waiter had a great sense of humour. We were even given a tour of Casa Loma by one of the managers after our meal. The food was tasty, from the cheddar roll appetizer, to the freshly-made Caesar salad. Save this for your next special occasion!",4
Amazing the best staff ever üíñ cannot wait to go back,4
Incredible place to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The food & ambience was impeccable. Our server Sergio cannot be matched. His knowledge & pristine care to his diners was extremely personal. Cannot wait to go back!!!,4
"Great experience. Only complaint was that we were not seated in the room that we reserved. Other than that, 10/10 experience. Will return.",4
"This place was just amazing from the food to the decor. Would definitely recommend, a great place to impress or special occasion.",4
Jacob was such a kind and patient server. Mike the AGM was so kind and knowledgeable. The atmosphere on the outdoor terrace. Thank you for making our evening a special one.,4
"It was for my wife‚Äôs birthday and first time experience in this place, probably not going to happen for the second time. 
Too many ppl and noisy place, food was ok but not really special or memorable. Left note of special request for a better sits and table, but pretty much at the corner. And the ppl sits next to us speak so loud and no social distance at all, coughing all the time‚Ä¶.
However, just a fair experience overall.",1
It was amazing birthday dinner!,4
"Amazing, food was incredible with VERY generous portions. Great venue. We went for a bachelor party and they bachelor left with a parting gift, extremely classy touch from a classy restaurant.",4
Caesar Salad was amazing. Crabs cakes were a bit too greasy. Steak was a bit to fatty. But overall great time.,3
Everything was great but we ordered a main course was steak with 2 sides and they brought the sides 15 minutes after the main course which was dissatisfied.,2
"One of the best dining experiences I've had in Torronto. From being greeted at the entrance to the impeccable service, this was a truly memorable experience. The drinks were great and every single dish from the appetizer to the dessert was delicious.   A special shout-out Lucas, he was amazing and very attentive to our group.",4
"Food, drinks, and service are all quite well, but not impressive.
Basically the value lies to the atmosphere.",3
"Excellent Service, knowledgable staff.
An Excellent Anniversary dinner with the best view in the city.

Simeon",4
Excellent food and service.,4
Good was delicious but very pricey,3
Food was good. When we requested to pay our bill the waiter had already put in 20% tip. This is very rude to put tip in for the customer.,0
"Great food, great service! Our server was the best. The portions are more than i expected too.",4
"Such a great dinner at blueblood! Our waiter educated us on the different types of steaks, German Rieslings and also brought out a tomahawk steak for us to see how big it actually is. I will definitely go here again",4
Best food and visual experience in the city tough to find anything with the same vibe,4
Lovely venue.  Such a large and varied menu.  I really enjoyed the table side Baked Alaskan.,3
"Mother, daughter and granddaughters dinner. 
AMAZING!! 
Would recommend 
10 out of 10",4
Our server Reagan was so professional and efficient and added some little touches which made our evening amazing. Thanks for a great dinner,4
"Gio, our server was great! Food was cooked perfectly and delicious. Came for my girlfriend‚Äôs birthday and had a nice surprise gift from Gio. Overall amazing experience.",4
Amazing experience here. Came here for my fianc√©s birthday and he absolutely loved it! I‚Äôm vegetarian and I even adored this restaurant and the staff! 10/10 experience.,4
Everything was fabulous!,4
Amazing food!!! Great view from the patio!,4
Fantastic evening. Everything was seamless. Food was wonderful and service was great. It was a special occasion and the staff made it seem very special. My husband and I just got back from Paris and last night rivalled anything we  did in Paris both from a food and service perspective (and we weren‚Äôt eating on the cheap there!). Last night was a very expensive evening but we knew it would be. Given what has happened to prices and service since COVID I think the pricing was in line with the experience we had and completely aligned with what I feel we all need to expect in this new world. We won‚Äôt go often but when we truly want a blowout night we will for sure return.,4
Staff were very nice and welcoming. They made it special. Was a lovely atmosphere,4
Best food and service served in a historic castle üè∞,4
"Amazing food and the service is impeccable to smallest detail.
Highly recommended!",4
It was great!!!,4
Amazing service and food,4
Had a good time! The service and food were both great! We‚Äôll definitely comeback. Thank you!!,4
Incredible snd amazing food and outstanding customer experience üôèüíé Will be coming back soon.,4
"Amazing service, beautiful venue and incredible food. Pricey though, so ideal for special occasion.",4
Fantastic as always.  First time trying the Wagyu Filer tasting and it was amazing.  Paired with the Blue Blood Chop Salad - divine,4
"Thank you for an amazing evening and dining experience 
The staff were amazing as well the food

Great place to celebrate a bday
We will be back",4
Amazing! Great food great service!,4
"The table side Caesar Salad and Baked Alaska were very cool. Like watching a show while you eat your dinner. We were seated beside a window and the sun was pouring in with no shade or way to block it. I held my menu beside my eyes for most of the meal. If not for that, it was perfect. The food and service were outstanding. The restaurant was quite loud, so if you're looking for a quiet dinner, it's not the right place. The patio looked beautiful. Pricey, but worth it.",4
"Our overall experience was excellent. The staff and their attentiveness made the difference. Even though we had a small glitch with one appetizer, the team recovered well!",3
We had an amazing dinner here! The ambiance was incredible and the service was exceptional. Thanks Stewart for a lovely dining experience. Would definitely recommend!,4
"Great place, great service, great people, amazing steaks",4
Beautiful building with outstandingly friendly staff who knows what theyre doing. the ambience was beautiful and not obtrusive to the dining experience. overall I had a great time with my friend,3
"Service was slow. Vegetable order was not brought out with Entree. Had to inquire. Lobster Bisque was poor, sent back but was charged for it. Food was not exceptional for the price.
Would not recommend for dinner, maybe just visit for a cocktail.",1
"Steaks were superb. Tuna Tartar was excellent. Grilled octopus was not hot and tasted like it had been reheated a couple of times, mealy and bland. Profiteroles were quite mediocre, a hard shell ( just out of the freezer?)with ordinary vanilla ice cream and chocolate and caramel sauce.

Can‚Äòt praise the meat enough! And the service ( David). 

Observations: the dessert menu is really quite ordinary : pies, pies and more heavy stuff. Please revise and come up with something more sophisticated.",3
"The ambience is beautiful. The server was very attentive - a little over the top saying "" Happy Birthday"" about 20 x during our meal.

Second time there and this time the steak was full of fat. Hardly edible. The sides ( asparagus and mashed potatoes )and desserts were very good. 

I would try again but not for steak which should be their speciality.",1
"There was a mix up with our tickets to the Princess Diana show and dinner at Blue Bloods. However the manager was quick to make it right.
Thank you for making our evening one to remember.",4
"Best service ever thanks to Terrence and Florent !  Hats off gentlemen!!
Nice atmosphere and dinner.",3
It was fantastic ... the food was phenomenal ... The portions were huge .... The staff were so attentive and friendly ... The grounds  and surroundings were beautiful.,4
Lovely dinner service and quality,4
An exceptional service to say the least üëå,4
"Kelli or Kelly or Kely, not sure how you spell his name, but he was amazing. Heather knew everything about wine. What an experience!",4
All of the staff were amazing and made our experience great. We definitely recommend ordering the starter caesar salad!,4
"spectacular venue!!  what a gem!  other than a slight mis-step with one of the appetizers, the food and dessert were magnificent.  Service is a tad slow - lots of servers, but took some time to order, so be patient.  we went for a special occasion (anniversary) and it truly was a special treat.  would go again, what a great experience!!!",4
Gio was fantastic. Our steak was not cooked as we specififed and he took care of it with no issues.,4
Amazing dining experience. It‚Äôs more than just the food. It‚Äôs the whole experience. Went there to celebrate a birthday and our host/server was so welcoming and very knowledgeable about every aspect of the menu and premises. Really appreciated the handwritten note to my husband from the team to wish him a happy birthday. Would recommend any day!!,4
The cutlery wasn't very clean; it was water stained. The service was mediocre and the foie gras was the worstü§¢,2
The ambience and service were excellent. The value wasn‚Äôt there for the food. Our medium rare rib eye was just rare and very fatty. Our duck fat fries were uncooked. The Caesar salad was excellent!,3
Had a fabulous time and the service was outstanding!  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and the food was fantastic.  Great suggestions from those taking care of us for the evening!  LOVED it!,4
"Excellent dining experience, incredible staff, delectable food nestled in a historic gem!!  Sargent pepper was one one the best cocktails I‚Äôve ever had!!",4
"Lots of staff to support.  Our server Geo, was amazing, very helpful to chose our order and a very pleasant, amazing person.",4
The service and food was impeccable. We were celebrating a friends birthday. The server brought a beautiful chocolate and fruit dessert accompanied with a gift of a Casa Loma wine bottle cork.,4
It felt like a very top notch restaurant. The server was very knowledgeable about the cuts of steak. The banana crepes was great and the man cooked them on a cart in front of us. It was like a work of art. The staff really cares about creating a fine dining experience.,4
Great experience!!,4
"Had a great evening with fantastic food, great service from Issac and overall pleased with everything.  Starting from the valet to the wine choice.",4
We just celebrated our sons' 30th birthday. The entire evening was a delight.  The food was more than we could ask for. There is an extensive wine list that will delight any wine  connoisseur. The menu is diverse and has offerings for any palette.  Our server was very pleasant and attentive and gave us some great suggestions. The room was so elegant with a warm inviting ambiance.  I can't say enough about what a lovely evening we had and I would highly recommend it.,4
Amazing service paired with even better food made this night out unforgettable.,4
Very beautiful ambiance and setting. Apps are small portions. Steaks amazing! Nice place to celebrate special occasion.,4
"Outstanding as always!  Service was exemplary, the food exquisite and the ambience on the terrace, breathtaking!",4
The staff were slow serving my table in comparison to other tables,4
"The service is great. The atmosphere is great, but a bit overpriced.",4
"Food was very overpriced per it‚Äôs quality. The server was rude, made little to no eye contact and did not make us feel welcomed.",1
"We had an amazing experience at Blue Bloods, the service, atmosphere and food were beyond our expectations.",4
"I‚Äôve had better service at chain restaurants. Unless you look like you are on the Forbes list, then be prepared to be treated like trash. I went to celebrate my 22nd birthday with a few close friends, and our waiter treated us like we weren‚Äôt there. The food is good, but the experience is not even close to what you are going to spend. If you are looking for a nice outing, then I highly suggest you go elsewhere.",0
"A great place to go to for the ambience, to look at the view of the city, especially when you sit on the patio at the back of the castle, great service, and excellent and well cooked food!! A great experience! Shout out to Gio our server! He explained the meanu thoroughly, had patience with us and was very welcoming!",4
Our server was wonderful! We enjoyed the experience as this was our first time dining here.,4
My steak was over cooked. Mentioned it and got free desserts.  Really?  I only ate a few mouthfuls if my steak.  It should have been replaced.  Waiter was disingenuous.  The best part was Isabella who made our salad at the table!,2
"Stunning venue! Took the whole family for dinner and ate on the patio with a view of the Toronto skyline. Portions are large so we ordered several dishes to share - not one disappointed. The staff took incredible care of us all,  and even made sure our four year old (wearing her princess dress, because it's a castle after all) enjoyed herself. Highly recommend for a special night out in Toronto!",4
"Thank you to all staff at BB. From checking in to checking out the entire dinner exceeded expectations. Great attention to detail and service, especially in regards to any allergies (one of us has Celiac). Portion sizes were bigger than expected and we definitely took some food home with us we were so full. Definitely coming here again.",4
"Excellent service, the best I've ever experienced. Food was great too",4
N/a‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.;.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,3
"Great service and atmosphere. Staggeringly low quality food, especially given the $500.00 for two price tag without alcohol. Steaks were burnt, not charred,,,, Burnt. Sides cold and mediocre quality. An absolute crime to charge what they do and refer to themselves as a top Toronto steakhouse. 
We‚Äôre still shocked. Would‚Äôve been an evening better spent anywhere else.",1
"Jacques our sommelier was excellent.  He was attentive, amusing and incredibly knowledgeable.",3
"The rib eye steak was not that great 
And all very expensive
The Caesar salad that was freshly made was very very salty",2
"Great restaurant to dine at. Excellent service and delicious food.
Ambiance is also impressive.",4
"One of the best restaurants we‚Äôve been too! Our server was incredible, very attentive! delicious food and wine",4
Every detail was excellent.  Service was great as was the food. Sitting outside on the terrace is just lovely!,4
I liked because I can have fresh air and the service was very good üëçüèº,4
"Great service, best I've ever come across. Thank you to Terrence, our waiter for the night who went above and beyond to provide such friendly service.",4
"We went there for an anniversary dinner. Ordered a tomahawk steak with 2 sides. Asked for the steak to be cooked medium it came out medium rare if anything it was more rare than anything else,the server argued it was medium to which it was not so we got it sent back. Food came back and the steak was 3 different types of temperatures from medium rare to almost cremated. We had to wait about an hour from ordering to getting our food the second time the hunger got the better of us so we just ate it even though we weren‚Äôt satisfied again!! If your looking for a proper steakhouse from my experience this isn‚Äôt the place to go especially when the steak alone is $200. Definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone!",2
"Outstanding atmosphere , delish food, professional wait staff , awsome menu‚Ä¶ what else could you want?",4
Beautiful evening the service was wonderful.  The food ( filet mignon)and deserts were amazing! Definitely going back.,4
"I love everything, service and food was beyond great! We will come back for sure.",4
"I feel home cooked is better than any expensive restaurants. The food wasn‚Äôt bad but wasn‚Äôt that jaw dropping good either. Maybe I was expecting too much since I paid 600$ worth of food and non alcoholic drink. But it is still better from places I have tried. Just one more well done meat means cooked properly I know, but juicy as well it looked like it was boiled before and then it was sizzled on pan eve r where.  I just wanted something nice on Mother‚Äôs Day as it‚Äôs an important day for me. I know waiting for it to being cooked takes time but if I‚Äôm paying enough I wanted enough time and preparation put in to cook it as well. But still it‚Äôs better than CN tower or keg steakhouse for sure. The medium rare steak are good.",2
Absolutely INCREDIBLE in every way from staff to food to ambiance!!,4
"Great location inside Casa Loma.  The decor is exactly what you expect. Service was 5star, food quality the same. Pricey, but memorable cocktails too.",4
"I wanted to always try a steakhouse, this was my first one and I was not disappointed! Our server was very attentive. The steak was definitely the best I have had ever; no more going back to franchises like the Keg. The one thing I would say is that our seats were not the best. We were seated at the entrance walkway, so there was alot of server traffic. While it was nice to see the different foods coming through it was slightly annoying. Overall it was a very enjoyable evening!",3
It was my wife‚Äôs 50th birthday,4
"I have dined around the world and this was by far the most amazing experience. The food was divine, service was top notch and the ambiance was on another level. Highly recommend!",4
Food was good  tatar beef had no taste need some spices salt pepper etc. waiter charged for 3x750ml water no way we drink so much water i asked him out on it he said we did. That was a scam should leave bottle on table which was consumed,2
Food was excellent. Service was great. No one rushed us we were able to enjoy our time. It is pricey. It does feel a little cramped. But overall it was a very nice experience and we had a great time.,4
Everything was amazing the washroom is just inconvenient located. Especially if there‚Äôs an event. I‚Äôll consider having dedicated washrooms for the restaurant.,4
Great experience!  our waiter was off the charts a super pro! Most accommodating and professional!,4
An amazing dining experience. From the moment you arrive it was an exceptional experience,4
"Outstanding service. Kelly served our table, and he is simply the greatest. We had the head Sommelier,  Marie recommend us such amazing wine and made our experience 10/10.",4
"Special Thankyou!  'Geo' for going the extra mile, and making our evening a wonderful experience.  We look forward to visiting you at BlueBlood Casa Loma soon.",4
Definitely expensive but worth it for the amazing seafood tower with the BIGGEST shrimp and crab legs i‚Äôve ever seen. Delicious and perfectly prepared wagyu and amazing table side dessert service. 10/10 would recommend to try at-least once,4
"The food quality was terrible. Oysters smelled and the sauces were watered down, served us soggy, old asparagus had to make the server take it back, mushrooms were swimming in an oil that was strong and smelly. Overall the quality of the food was horrible couldn‚Äôt believe it. The service however was very good and up to expectation.",1
"We were there to celebrate our 36th Anniversary. Our server was amazing, the food was beyond exceptional and it‚Äôs was beautiful and romantic. Best Anniversary to date!! Thank you so much for making our day so wonderful!!",4
"This was the worse experience ever 
$450 for spicy Caesar salad, cold food, and bad tasting steaks",0
"I chose Blueblood Steakhouse to celebrate my 30th birthday with my friends, because I thought it would be an amazing experience and that it would be a special memory. However, I was very disappointed. My friends' steaks were overcooked. We asked our waiter to come have a look, but instead of offering to replace the overcooked steaks, he tried to gaslight us into thinking that we were not able to distinguish the degree of doneness for steaks. At the end, the manager was kind enough to replace one of the steaks and take one of them off the bill. Regardless, we had a terrible experience. It was definitely not the right choice to spend my 30th birthday at this restaurant.",0
Food quality is far from service quality. Please reflect on that.,3
"Classic dishes with some flair, served in a unique atmosphere.  Attentive staff.",4
"I came here with my boyfriend as part of the candlelight symphony special event with the prix fixe menu
Food was excellent :) 
Definitely worth trying out at least once in your life!",4
We had an amazing experience here. The service was outstanding and the food was incredible. We will definitely be back! The seafood tower is a MUST-HAVE!!!,4
Great meal and drinks beautiful location and fantastic service,4
Fantastic ambience . Great for a romantic evening . The steaks were the best my wife and I have ever had . . A tad pricey but definitely worth it !,4
The overall experience was great The food was good,3
"One of the best sirloin steaks I have ever had. Amazing food, services and most of all ambiance.",4
"I was dining with my daughter, who does not drink wine, so I was happy to be able order a glass of wine to go with  my appetizer, steak and desert.

Great meal",4
"Excellent ambiance, service and food! My hubby really enjoyed it all, and bonus on music choice and the artwork.",4
good place for romantic events.  excellent service,3
"Fantastic food, amazing service, and captivating atmosphere. Would highly recommend.",4
"i‚Äôve never been to a better steakhouse. from the service to the food, everything was impeccable. 5 stars",4
Server was a bit careless. Didnt really offer much help with menu and the handling of the plates and drinks was kind of rough,3
This is the place for an unforgettable experience of delicious food and drinks with excellent service.,4
"The ambience is what you are paying for. The food was not the best. We ordered a two filet cuts, one regular and one wagyu. They came out a bit dry.
The appetizer we ordered was a bit dry as well.

Overall impression of food was subpar, the ambience and setting was very nice.",2
Food was not very warm when it arrived. Small portions that were over priced.,2
We had a team dinner at Blue Bloods and it was an amazing night.  Our server Alex was incredible.  He was super knowledgeable in recommendations and very attentive to our needs.  Food and drinks were delicious and loved the ambiance.  Would highly recommend and would definitely go back,4
"Overall, we were okay but the onion rings was really hard to eat",4
"Spectacular as always.
Food cooked to perfection. 
Great experience. 
4 star for our server. He works for fine dining, he should lose the arrogance and the ‚ÄúI know everything‚Äù. Your chef trained you what to say and you don‚Äôt know if you are talking to another chef who is dining there. Be humble otherwise life will humble you (or another chef‚Ä¶)",4
"Amazing food , smart and polite servers . What a great experience we had on our anniversary!",4
our server was so charming and it was special to be in casa loma. everything was delicious and it was a memorable evening,4
"Pretty fantastic. Perfect destination for an anniversary or special occasion. Great wine selection too.  Our server (Stewart) was knowledgeable and charming. The bill adds up quickly, but its well worth it for a such a memorable evening.",4
"Service never fails 10/10, food was exquisite!!!  Perfect ambiance for a romantic dinner.",4
Amazing experience from the food to the service! Fantastic time celebrating a birthday!,4
"Beautiful ambiance, romantic and elegant. Wonderful for a special occasion",4
We had an amazing dinner and then we saw the candlelight symphony! what an experience!,4
Excellent meal for an excelling evening out! Would definitely go again.,4
"It was amazing, the food, the service, the atmosphere. Just incredible",4
"Have wanted to try BB for some time now. We got the opportunity to do that along with a small concert in the carriage house. The prix fixe menu cam along with some tickets to the show.

Our server Dax was fantastic. Personable and easy going, he never hovered and was always watch as he made his rounds to see if we needed anything. His suggestions were spot on at every turn.

Being a professional waiter is all about the art of subtlety - and Dax nailed it.

The food was fantastic.

Cocktails were well built and flavourful. The wine list had something for everyone (a few offerings from our neighbour's at Closson Chase Vineyards) and my Barolo was brilliant.

The prix fixe menu came with 6 American oysters. They were so fresh I went off prix fix and grabbed another dozen. Super fresh (you could smell the ocean on them ever after the rise). Bacon mignonette was mind blowing and I gave serious thought to stealing what was left so I could try to make it at home.

16oz bone out rib-eye was perfectly cooked (or not cooked) to rare. Buttery with a solid marbling of fat and perfectly aged. After my wife let me try her Miso Chilean Sea Bass - I almost order the second entree. Dead serious. I ALMOST did a double entree!

The mashed potatoes. OMG the mashed potatoes! A side should be the best the kitchen can offer, but this mashed. If you said I could choose between a scoop of Hagen Das vanilla ice cream of a scoop of these mashed potatoes - I'm gonna pick the mashed every time. Not some cutting edge thing. No strange new ingredients. No fusion twist. Just REALLY> GREAT> MASHED> POTATOES.

Deserts - once again, taken to a new level. The coconut cream pie was like no other I have tasted. Meringue based with lemon accent. Every bite melted from one flavour to the next in a story for the taste buds. A desert experience.",4
"I bought the VIP experience for the Candlelight Symphony and it certainly surpassed my expectations. The food and drinks were delicious, and the staff was great at making us feel welcome, and even found us the smallest dessert they had when we were full but still wanted to do a little something for my partners birthday. Their efforts were certainly appreciated and I can‚Äôt wait to go back for more!",4
"We had an incredible dinner with exceptional service from Ian while entertaining visitors from England.  The food was amazing, we had the porterhouse and the tomahawk.  I highly recommend this as an experience for anyone hosting guests or a romantic night out.",4
One of the best steakhouses in Toronto. Definitely will be back very soon. Our server offered outstanding service and great recommendations. The atmosphere and ambience was perfect. Overall 5 stars!!,4
"That‚Äôs the best ever restaurant in Toronto. Wonderful staff, wonderful service, wonderful meal.",4
"Great place! Enjoyed every moment due to the amazing food, ambience and service. A real treat. Will be coming again!",4
"First experience and it will be the last. The culinary experience was an extreme disappointment and overrated. We were planning on booking our wedding reception with Casa Loma and relieved we did not. The whole experience was underwhel.staff wore black jeans with horrifying body odour making it difficult to eat our meal. For the value, it was a terrible experience.",0
Amazing food! Amazing service! Amazing atmosphere!,4
"The service, ambiance, and food were immaculate. I am really glad I took my boyfriend here for dinner for his birthday!",4
"Wow! Impressed from the moment we parked. Start to finish, the service and food was excellent! Our server, Costa, was very attentive, helpful and quite knowledgeable. He even took the time to give us a quick tour of the castle and each room. Thank you Costa!",4
Exceptional Restaurant. Service and food was excellent.,4
"The food is great, the symphony orchestra is lovely. Service is impeccable, however our sever is irritating and way too pushy. I am fine with you asking if we need something or how was the food but not in a way that he will rearrange what i had in my plate. And keeps on arranging the utensils in our table in the middle of our meal. I find it annoying, leave us a bit of privacy to enjoy our meal/ night.",4
Excellent meal and service. beautiful ambiance!,4
Amazing food and service,4
"Very nice service , the food was good we had an amazing experience",4
I had an amazing time. The food was perfect and everything made the celebration more to special. Would definitely go back for a special occasion.,4
"My experience was like no other restaurant in town. From when I arrived to when I left. Full service restaurant, vallet to checking in at the front all the way to getting seated. The whole time I felt like I was being served by a personal waiter. With some of the best food I have ever had in my life. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone that wants that extra attention to detail.",4
"We loved our experience at Bluebloods. Stuart was amazing, attentive, kind and friendly. He really made sure we had everything we needed and checked-in on us.",4
"Was clear when I made the reservation to be seated in the Billiards Room at a specific seating location; to my disappointment they didn‚Äôt follow instructions and failed to communicate why they took us to a different room. When I asked to be seated in the rounded booth next to us facing the window instead of facing the wall, there was a discussion on the side and we were told that the other booth was meant for a larger group and that our booth was smaller for a group of 4 ‚Ä¶we have eyes lol the booth directly in front/beside us was identical in size. Then 20 min later they seated a group of 3. Off to a bad start.

The server we had was attentive, no complaints there.

The food on the other hand - I‚Äôve come here more than once to try different items and honestly everything is way overpriced for what you are getting - flavour is lacklustre and just overall isn‚Äôt outstanding in the way you would expect it should be. Can find much better food at the same or less price. Definitely not memorable and nothing excites me to want to come back and dine. It‚Äôs more of a status dining/special occasion dining (one and done), which is completely fine. Also, so many other steakhouses/even butcher shops to taste high quality, flavourful Wagyu steaks. 

In my opinion, not worth it to come back.",2
"Food was incredible!! Had foie gras app, Mishima wagyu rib eye, and profiterole for dessert (which was huge, even sharing with another person). We booked a table in the ""library room"" but there was not a book in sight, and a bit too loud for conversation. Service was mostly great, although a bit uneven; water glass kept constantly filled but I had to wait for a glass of wine.",3
Amazing Restaurant. It was my first time there and I was a amazed how good is the food and environment. Servers are fantastic.,4
I was with a group of 9ppl... The service was fantastic,3
Wonderful first experience. Issac provided perfect service in the Library and food was exceptional. Highly recommend for both food and dining experience. Yes it‚Äôs expensive but it‚Äôs worth it and not an everyday thing. Enjoy!,4
We had Connor as a server he was amazing professional knowledgable courteous the food was outstanding as was the atmosphere we enjoyed the whole experience,4
"We did not like our table and they moved us to a exceptional table

Service was outstanding and food was delicious",4
"Great atmosphere, food and service.  We sat in the Oak room which seemed more lively than the Library (which is where we originally booked).",4
"Everything was exceptional, including the price. Great for a special occasion.",4
"This will be my final time coming here. Service was awful, 3/4 people got meat at my table and all of them were cooked incorrectly and burnt on the outside. When the gentlemen came to bring out meat out and started passing out the dishes, we paused for a second to recall the type of steak we ordered as all three guests got the same steak just cooked differently. He rolled his eyes as he walked away from our table. I‚Äôm really unsure how at one of the most high end and classiest restaurants in Toronto, this kind of behaviour is tolerated. The dessert they brought us was incorrect and we had to wait an extra 15 min for our new dessert after already waiting 25 min. Food is disgustingly expensive and not nearly worth the money spent. Save your time, energy and money. Don‚Äôt go.",0
Great service!,4
Awesome. Great experience.,4
Incredible food and unbeatable ambience. Our server Kelly was so attentive /top notch and made our experience even more special. We can‚Äôt wait to return.,4
"Classy place, great food and service , knowledgeable staff. 
Dress appropriately",4
"First time at Blueblood Steakhouse. I‚Äôve heard so much about this place and it‚Äôs been on my list for a while. 
So of course I decided to book a table to celebrate my moms bday and treat the people nearest and dearest to me. The atmosphere was wonderful! Being in a castle helps lol
The staff and servers were exceptionally friendly and amazing! The table side Caesar was the best I‚Äôve ever had in my life and would go back just to eat that alone! I loved everything we ordered. The tomahawk steak was huge and tasty! All the sides and appetizers were delicious. I would go back to try other items on the menu. I highly recommend to everyone to go at least once. For those on a budget I would plan ahead as this restaurant doesn‚Äôt come cheap but is WORTH IT!",4
"A fantastic experience. Elegant and opulent with great service and a truly experientially unique vibe. Food was priced a little high and wine was definitely a gouge. $14 bottles of wine were being sold at $18 a 6 oz glass, but the night was delightful all the same.  We even got a personal tour of parts of Casa Loma after our meal. Most awesome. We loved it",4
"Our dinner was wonderful. Kelly was our server and he was excellent. He was attentive without being intrusive. The ambiance is incredible as well.

The food we thought was good but not exceptional. But we did enjoy every bite and the drinks were great too.",3
"Steak was incredible , did the waygu tasting , ordered the duck fat fries , under cooked in the middle was not impressed especially the price they charge for fries lol 
But this was my second visit and I would definitely return",3
I was not Happy to be imposed a TIP of 20% your terminal states Customise you TIP and have 18% as TIP option but the waiter refused me to select 18% or to customise. My Bill was $230.00 want told him to customise the TIP to get a total of $250.00 CAD event including the TIP he refused!,2
"I was blown away from upon arrival to unfortunately having to leave.

the service was the best I've ever experienced anywhere!  the personal touches each wait staff provided was energetic, professional,  and knowledgeable.

The atmosphere was magical to say the least - If you are on the fence about coming here then hopefully this review will change your mind. you will not be disappointed.

I will definitely be coming back whenever I'm visiting Toronto. 
I have been talking about my experience to anyone and everyone. 

Thanks to all for making my evening as memorable as  you did",4
"Room was very nice, service was welcoming and attentive. Food was very bland and not worth the money. Can receive the same level of service with far superior food at the same price point at different steakhouses in the city. ($800 for 3 people including 18% tip)",1
"I requested seating in the Library but was sat in the Billiard Room when I asked why they said they don't really pay attention to those requests.  They did offer to move us but I did not want to move as we were already settled.  I felt like they stuck us at the kids table when we were there to celebrate an important occasion.  Was also disappointed to see many diners in very casual attire - sweatpants and hoodies.  I guess fine dining is a thing of the past.  Food was good, drinks were excellent and service was attentive.  Given the overall atmosphere of trashy tourist not sure of a repeat visit.",3
"As always everything was perfect! The staff is awesome, we had great time! We‚Äôre still thinking about the Steak Tar Tar‚Ä¶ sooo good! The Wagyu Steak and Sea Bass were cook to perfection! And the Baked Alaska!! Mmm Mmm Mmmm!! Can‚Äôt wait to come back!!",4
"Blair was fantastic. Made me laugh all night. Dex was a fantastic server. 

I unfortunately didn‚Äôt love the Sommeliers choice",3
"Amazing good and service, incredible wine selection and the steaks are out of this world! Too restaurant in Toronto!",4
Steak was over done and not worth the price they were asking. Expected better quality. Specialty drink was excellent. Overpriced for the experience.,3
"Wonderful service , meal a bit expensive",4
"The food is excellent.
Gio was a great server.
Great ambience - you can't beat!",4
"The staff at Blue Blood Steakhouse were amazing and made our 1st anniversary, one to remember for sure! The food was great and for a first time Wagyu beef trial, it‚Äôs definitely worth it! 

Kelly is the best server I‚Äôve ever had the chance of meeting. He knows his stuff, very polite and friendly, and has mastered serving and presentation. Also a shout out to the host, and Costa. 

I will definitely be back!

Thanks for having us.",4
"Food was 10/10 
Service was 10/10
Waiter Andy had immaculate service 
And sure deserve a bonus with the professional and great service he provided",4
"Dax was our server, and he made our anniversary something special!",4
A beautiful experience that was worth the wait!,4
"Dressing up made the night feel more special and eventful. The personal attention of the staff was wonderful and felt very natural. Sides are sized to share, and a the mouthwateringly rich cheesecake can feed a family. Overall, it was a wonderful and delightful event to celebrate on our honeymoon.",4
Was told I‚Äôll be able to order food and they didn‚Äôt serve food,0
Food was fine. Very expensive.  Wouldn‚Äôt go back.,1
Our family really enjoyed the meal; service and food. Would definitely recommend.,4
Overall amazing. Get food get people respectful workers,4
Amazing experience. Can not compare to any other steakhouse. Service was unmatched.,4
Coconut cream pie was as delicious as it looks! A definite must have!,4
"Great waiters and services.  Though originally the hostess was going to give us a crabby table even though the nicer dining  was practically empty! And our reservation was very early (4:30!)   She offered us a Hugh table for 8 while we were 4 people.   We were dumbfounded so asked her for a more appropriate table 
She did obliged but told us we had only 2 hours because that nicer table was reserved after 2 hours.   No we‚Äôre fine with the timing 
That was the initial turn off but the rest of the meal was fantastic.   We will return!",3
"The food was ok. Other than that, nothing special!!",2
Service an ambiance was awesome.  Food was only ok,3
"Food was delicious, service was awesome, detail to the clientele was right on point. Great value for the quality of food we received. Over all magical night.",4
If you are looking for a nice meal in Toronto this is your place. The food I had at this restaurant is by far the best I have had in my entire life. The service was outstanding and overall accommodating. I wish I could give this place a higher review than 5 stars.,4
Worth the experience. Great food and excellent service.,4
Beautiful venue with outstanding service. Our server Kelly was extraordinary in his service & personality. Our dinners arrived in perfect timing and everything was delicious. My second time at BlueBlood & I will be back. Attention to detail stands out right down to the clear ice cubes. Best Manhattan I have ever tasted. I highly recommend this unique and outstanding restaurant.,4
Incredible experience. Food was phenomenal.,4
"We decided to come here to celebrate my husband's birthday. I booked the billiard room, but was brought to another room. I was disappointed already from the start. We ordered a seafood tower for $140 for 2 people. We didn't mind paying a lot since this place was rated ""#1 steakhouse in Toronto"" but oh boy, we we're wrong. Seafood tower was not fresh at all. the crab legs tasted like it was cooked long time ago and put in the fridge for an easier preparation. it was dry and no sauce from that tower was good. We ordered aged rib eye since our waiter suggested that it was the best one.. verdict is, my best friend cooks way better steak than what we had at blueblood.. steak tasted really charred and very much under seasoned or not seasoned AT ALL.. they give you salt and pepper on the side though..but it defeats the purpose of going to a steakhouse for a nice delicious steak if i'm supposed to season it myself.. huh? I ordered miso seabass for myself.. it was good. the skin was the only thing marinated.. the inside of seabass was plain but the skin compensated all the flavour so that's good. Mac n cheese was probably the best thing we had here.. considering this is a steak house and not a southern bbq place.. very much dissapointed. We don't understand how they have the audacity to be called #1? Spend $500 somewhere else for a nice meal for 2 ppl..",1
What an incredible experience! David and the rest of the staff gave our large party a night to remember. The food was outstanding. The service impeccable with many personal touches. David showed incredible patience while we all ordered our drinks at separate times and was attentive throughout the meal while not hovering. There was laughter and joy all evening. I highly recommend the table side Caesar salad. That is an experience in itself. Thank you to all for making our friend‚Äôs 40th so special.,4
"Nice place nice food and very considerate service, really recommend",4
Two of our dishes were cold and the salmon was not seasoned.,1
It was all that we had hoped for.  We enjoyed every moment of our experience and look forward to returning to try more from the menu. Thank you.,4
"Amazing food, great service, highly recommended for any occasion.",4
The food was phenomenal! The chef came and chatted with us and Trevor was one of the best servers I have ever had! Great experience!,4
"Bday celebration. We enjoyed! Service was great, had the table Caesar Salad and the Baked Alaska..so interesting to watch them prepare them... highly recommend. We ordered also grilled Octopus. Waygu steak, Salmon, Lobster MacnCheese - all dishes were delicious! We loved the Ambience.... buzzing....we were in the Oak room which I also recommend. Received a tiny gift n card for my bday from them -- def a magical evening! Enjoy if u go!!",4
It was one of the best experience I had.,4
Excellent service and food! Perfect for a special occasion,4
"Excellent service level from being received until the end of our meal! The steaks are one of a kind that I have never seen or enjoyed at any other restaurant in North America, and I travel on business 40 weeks of the year on business. I took my daughter-in-law for a 30th birthday celebration and wow she absolutely enjoyed her steak and the service level experience. After the six of us enjoyed our steaks, the restaurant provided complementary Baked Alaska for desert!",4
Wow! What amazing experience !!! Will definitely be returning !! Thank you for a lovely momentum anniversary gift !!,4
"Steak was undercooked though I asked for medium , meat is not tender I would say it‚Äôs below average I expected way better steak .

Prawns and octopus are good though .",1
Staff is extremely courteous and thoughtful. We enjoyed our appetizers and desserts.,4
"Enjoyed our oysters,lobster and steak. Very nice ambiance. Enjoyed the candle lit symphony too very much. Everyone should try it at least one time . Beautiful and perfect service.",3
"Steaks came out cold, apps were subpar. Service was fantastic. Overall not worth it though.",2
"we were a group of 4, the service was fantastic and exceptional, as was the ambience.   However the food was not great:  the steaks were not cooked to our asking, dry not juicy, not flavourful, not hot, warm.  You really needed the sauces, except the bernaise sauce was not the greatest - it tasted funny and I would not recommend.   The apps were good as was the raw oysters.",2
Great venue for the ambience and would come back for special occasions!,3
"Amazing atmosphere! I mean, who doesn't want to have dinner in a castle?! Really enjoyed our food and date night! Thank you!",4
"Wagyu was excellent. The table side Caesar is always a favourite as is the tableside baked Alaska which I highly recommend. Other sides and appetizers were very good but not mind-blowing. In the front dining room the noise level is a bit loud and requires you to raise your voice to speak to someone across the table, but did not prevent conversation. Library room is better for conversation. The coolest thing bout this restaurant is the ambience, and the fact that you can wander around the museum as a part of your visit. The period bedrooms, sitting rooms, and military museum are all completely open and accessible. Restaurant and serving staff are full of information about the history of the site and happy to share many interesting stories and facts!",4
"Overall experience was excellent, the waiter that assisted us was very professional. Highly recommend this place for a romantic night out with your significant other. We will go back again, especially for the wagyu steak and lobster Mac and cheese.",4
Food allergy noted in reservation was acknowledged by server immediately upon being seated.  Excellent service.  Excellent allergen-free meal!,4
Delicious food! A gorgeous location! and  Outstanding service! A big thank you to David and colleagues who made my friend‚Äôs birthday so special!,4
"Great restaurant, defintily will be going again.",4
"Great food and service. If you're looking to enjoy a special evening in a beautiful setting, this is your place.",4
Anniversary,4
"Top of the line food and service. Ian our server and Steve at the bar really made the experience unforgettable. Prices are on the higher end but worth every penny for the quality, attention and knowledge you receive. One of the best dining experiences we‚Äôve had!",4
The staff is incredible.They went above and beyond.  I went for my birthday and was treated like a queen and made thr rest of my party feel just as special. They made the experience so unforgettable that paired with the ambiance was simply fantastic. I didn‚Äôt have much of an appetite that day so I just had the Caesar salad is was delicious and made right in-front of you!!! The rest of my party didn‚Äôt love their mains but I can‚Äôt speak on that. I knew I was going to enjoy the space more than the food for me personally. The birthday cake performance / presentation is so fun too! Would go back for sure.,3
Date night on a mini vacation with my spouse and went to the candlelit symphony orchestra,4
Wonderful atmosphere with great food. It is not any more expensive than any other high end (and special) restaurant. The wait staff are extremely courteous and happy to help. Special thanks to Dax for making it extra special and taking good care of us!,4
"Most amazing food, dedicated, attentive, extremely kind service, very quick",4
"Hello!! It was a great experience- absolutely awesome and the server was amazing. He exactly knew what we were looking for. Great food, ambiance  but I am very disheartened that my booking was for Oak Room for my hubby‚Äôs champagne birthday  and we were made to sit in the Parlour Room without giving us a reason for the change.",4
My wife and I have never been here before and it was great the food was unbelievable,4
Was charged for water. Was not notified by server it would cost so much.,1
The service was great! My partner and I had a great time. The servers were amazing. Food was out of this world. Drinks were so so good. Would definitely come back for a special occasion again.,4
Another patron was very rude. But the wait staff moved us and all was good.,2
Everything was great and really enjoyed the experience.,4
"The ambience and food was fantastic. The servers were very knowledgeable and helpful. 

It is fine dining through and through, including the price. From our experience, the price was worth it.",4
"Everything was exceptional per usual! Food, drinks, atmosphere, service staff.. excellent! Thank you for another amazing experience!",4
"The food and ambience were superb; we were served by Carly, who was simply amazing; he described the menu in great depth and maintained our table arranged and spotless on a frequent basis; we were blown away.",4
"It was by far one of the worst tasting dinners we have ever had, especially given the price and name of the restaurant.  My steak was overcooked and when they brought it back after I returned it, it was unseasoned, didn‚Äôt even have salt or pepper.  The carpaccio was frozen and pre made from the night before and we couldn‚Äôt unstick it off the plate.  Most of the appetizers were unseasoned or the server forgot to bring them.  For the price they charge, go spend your money somewhere else, as you can get way better food for your value.  Honestly, they can‚Äôt even come close to the Keg, let alone other reputable steakhouses.",2
"We dined in the library and it was  a beautiful ambience. The service was exceptional. The food was delicious and well priced. We had a wonderful time, we are looking forward to going back again as a family. This was great for date night.",4
"Service was decent. Definitely did not live up to my first visit at blue blood. Waiter was not as attentive and did not have nearly as much energy and pride in serving as our first waiter. 

Also, not a good look when waiters around us have high energy with other tables, consistently checking up on them, even going as far as making small talk. Nice guy buy again service is everything especially when it‚Äôs a high end restaurant.",3
"Nice team and very good service 
Should provide hot seafood",3
Wonderful restaurant to celebrate a special occassion,4
The best steak I've ever eaten! The service is just too of the line! I can't wait to go back!,4
"This was great evening. Truly enjoyed our event. Jacques, the sommelier and James our waiter made our evening truly memorable.",4
We ordered Waygu tasting course. The America waygu steak is stench and taste really bad. Other foods are normal and no memorizing points. This dinner cost us 700 dollars after tips. It‚Äôs not worth that price.,0
"Alex our server was impeccable from start to finish. He was able to describe the menu with confidence and demonstrated a strong understanding of each dishes ingredients. He accommodated our dietary restrictions with a breeze and coursed our meal accordingly. He even suggested pairings for our meal, leaving us the opportunity to say yes or no, we obviously said yes. Every restaurant I‚Äôve attended the server always seemed that they were unhappy to be there which isn‚Äôt the experience one looks forward to, or else we would stay home. He was not pushy at all and only came to the table when needed. The food was subpar but if Alex is the server again then I will certainly be back and recommend my friends as well. As this was my first date, the girl I was with was very impressed and I‚Äôm certain because of Alex, there will be many more to come. If you ever let him go your stupid and I‚Äôm certain any restaurant will be happy to take him with a raise!",4
"Wonderful experience overall! Food had great flavour, ambience was very intimate and relaxing, and service was very attentive. Would recommend.",4
"Great atmosphere, service and skills. We were sitting next a windows which was  abit leaky as it was a cold night.",4
"Our waiter Kelly was amazing. I‚Äôve never had such amazing service before. If you go to Blue Blood you‚Äôll be very happy if you have him as your waiter. He was very friendly, accommodating and professional. The food was also amazing. Definitely the best dining experience in Toronto. 10/10 recommend.",4
It was good,4
"We came from out of town and had high hopes for this renowned steakhouse. 

What a wonderful night. Great food, amazing service. Their sommelier is extremely knowledgeable and helped us pick out a fantastic bottle. Also the young man working in the valet is extremely personable! 

Would recommend Bluebloods to any of my friends. Make sure to try the Waygu 12oz!!!",4
"Beautiful dining room, amazing and attentive service. Food was delicious and the portions were great.",3
"Atmosphere is excellent,  food amazing and service is super üëå 5 stars all the way.",4
"Great ambiance, in fact probably the nicest dining room in the GTA. Dessert always a hit with large portions. Food was tasty as well.",4
"Everything was amazing. The only thing I could complain about was that I was seated by the window and it was a little chilly for me, other than that the food was impeccable, we had the place to ourselves for a bit, my boyfriend was ecstatic to celebrate his bday and our server was very attentive.",4
Great place for special occasions. I definitely recommend it!,4
Dinner at BlueBlood was beyond any of our expectation. The service was impeccable; Ian is the best host/ waiter you can have. Everything was 120% pleasant.  A fantastic night out - like the old days.,4
Our experience in this steak house was awesome. Service was good great food   I would highly recommend this place.,4
Bday celebration,4
"David the server was friendly and the food was good. Our reservation was for our 10th year anniversary in the library, but we were told there are no availability upon arrival and was placed in the oak room instead. Please don‚Äôt give the option of booking a reservation online in a room if it is not going to be available upon arrival. Thanks",3
Excellent service provided by the staff and the food was even more delicious. It was our anniversary dinner and it was worth it.,4
"Amazing ambiance and meal. We shared oysters to start, followed by a made to order Caesar salad made table side. We shared the Porterhouse with 2 sides prepared perfectly. Our only regret is we skipped dessert because we were so full! Will definitely be back.",4
"We have dined at many fine establishments which we love and keep going back again like Auberge and George but this time we decided to try something different and we must admit that it was quite disappointing.

The ambiance is nice that it is in Casa Loma but it was a bit dark in the library so it was difficult to see what we were eating.

The service was mediocre. It was difficult to get the attention of the waiters many times. We had to be the one trying to place a order rather than then being proactive and asking us what we would like. We also had to ask for water when the waiter should be aware to refill without asking. When asked about their steaks, they were not too knowledgeable compared to Jacobs. The table had breadcrumbs that were never cleaned before the next course arrived. Lastly, we placed an order of broccolini that never came and when asked about it (and we were done our steak), the waiter admitted that he forgot to put it in. I must say that was very very disappointing.

The food presentation was lacking and food was mediocre in taste. The tuna tartare's avocado was too sour. The octopus was a huge disappointment because it was obvious that they boiled it before grilling it. It was very mushy and bland (definitely overcooked). The lamb was good in flavor but lacked the pistachio crust mentioned in the menu. The striploin from Erindale Ontario was well made. The profiteroles was quite impressive though. It had a hot and cold and sweet and salty elements to it which was nice.

Overall, I am not sure that I would return because of the service.",2
"Excellent dinner. Everything from the cocktails, wine, food, and service was sublime. Dry aged striploin was perfectly cooked and superb tasting. Alaskan crab fritters were fantastic. Only recommendation I would make would be to let diners know on the menu the type of lobster tail available. I was expecting east coast but mine was spiny lobster. It was still delicious but the flavour is different from what I was used to. Will not hesitate to dine here again. 5 stars. Thanks for the wonderful experience.",4
"Great place. Great service. Realistically, a little overpriced.",3
"Absolutely best steak. However the lobster bisque abit disappointed because it is not hot enough. 

My wife love the dessert -baked Alaska. But her drink the one last thing is not as great as she thought. 

Overall a great place for birthdag celebration. But would like our server pay more attention to us and can give us recommendations on foods selection. And they should pay more attention to details such as the plating. My wife can hardly cut her Lamb chops due to the round curved plate.",3
"Our experience was top notch. 
Thank you to everybody.",4
Amazing experience and food! Accommodated a vegetarian and the place was hopping with customers!,4
The staff was incredible I will definitely return. The food was done very well. I really enjoyed my evening thank you to all the staff,4
Amazing food as always!,4
"The Asian waiter was arguing with a table behind us all night. he kept telling the guests you ordered this you picked it and made them select a certain steak, and then kept offering to call the manager but never did. And his tonality was so unprofessional and rude l. It was a bit distracting but otherwise our waitress was great, she was very helpful",3
"The overall ambiance is great. The drinks were delicious but the food is quite average, especially the steak.",3
"overall a great experience, food service and ambiance was all a 10/10. Definitely a place you would go to for a special occasion. It‚Äôs a great date night spot. I have not one negative thing to say about my experience here. I would return here for sure",4
"Delightful experience! The food was great, the service was impeccable. I highly recommend the table side Caesar salad. We were fortunate to sit in the library, which has outstanding ambiance.",4
"Wonderful experience, our server David was so personable and knew when to be attentive and when to give us time during our Valentine‚Äôs date. The ambience was wonderful, and everyone was having a great time. Meals were prompt, served hot and delicious.",4
Can‚Äôt wait to go back for more amazing food and fantastic cocktails üçπ,4
"Great experience, lovely atmosphere! I would definitely recommend. The services is exceptional‚Ä¶.",4
"Food was amazing, too a little bit to get each meal but it was worth the wait. The lamb practically melts in your mouth.",4
"There are restaurants that charge high prices but serves sub par food, this is not one of them. The food quality, presentation and portions are always impeccable. 
This place never disappoints!",4
Everything was very delicious but very overpriced. It was a nice experience but I‚Äôm not sure if I go there again :),4
"we booked for the library for a quiet anniversary dinner. they did not seat us there. too loud , ruined my anniversary",2
Food was good.  The value wasn't there. Alcohol was overpriced.,2
"This steakhouse doesn't compare to Jacobs & Co, the meat is no where near as well cooked. However, it's still a nice meal out. The service was quick and snappy, but the dining room was very busy and hard to hear my date. It was quite a lot of money as well, and honestly you're better off spending that money at Jacobs where the meat is better cooked and it's a much quieter place. The steak knives also weren't great, they were bulky and dull and completely unaesthetic.",3
"Everything was amazing, the food the service and the atmosphere. We are going back again for sure.",4
It is a place to be... I love everything about BluebBlood Steakhouseüíù,4
"Greedy establishment. The patio is not suitable for outdoor dinning when it‚Äôs -10 out. Eating at a premium restaurant with your winter jacket on and still being cold is unacceptable. If you choose to eat at this establishment, make sure it‚Äôs inside, otherwise you‚Äôre just burning your $$",0
"Awesome restaurant.  
Food was great and the vibe was too.",4
"This is a great restaurant and is an unique experience in Toronto .  Food was outstanding and service was an 11/10 .  Call out to our server Kwan, who is one the best servers in the city.  Super pricey but worth penny .  Thanks  to the whole team for making this a great evening out!",4
"Exceptional service. Impeccable dining experience; this is about as good as it gets in terms of Toronto fine dining. Easily my favourite spot within the city. I don‚Äôt know what we would do without the Casa Loma. From the special events which they host throughout each season which are next to none, to their exceptional dining experience at Blueblood; this is the perfect spot for a classy and elegant date night and for any sort of special occasion.",4
One of the best restaurants I‚Äôve ever been to. The decor was exceptional. Amazing vibes and ambiance. The staff was amazing.,4
Pricey but worth it! The food is delicious. Especially the oysters. The staff are very attentive and really make sure you have a great experience. Definitely a place worth trying if you like surf n turf.,4
"As expected of a steak house it was well cooked.
It was the starters and sides that really differentiates this one from the rest ive been in.",4
Thw food and service is amazing!,4
"Seafood tower was ok, nothing special. The cesare and steak were amazing and you cant go wrong with any of the desserts.

Service and atmosphere really was spectacular.",3
"Every time we come, it‚Äôs a pleasure to be in this place. 
The atmosphere, the service and food are just amazing ! 
Highly recommended",4
It was a great experience,4
"Is really overpriced  ordered the crab fritters but very disappointing , very chewy and not very tasty , steaks were huge and couldn‚Äôt finish mine, sides are expensive but enough for a table of four, mashed potatoes tasted like they were out of a packet as was the Hollandaise , starter salad enough for three people",3
We had a wonderful evening at blue bloods.  It was a special event for us and they helped make it very memorable.  The team was great and the food absolutely on point.,4
Birthday for friend,2
"Another delicious visit. The wagyu beef carpaccio was superb, as was the table side ceasar, asparagus, and gnocci. The steaks were amazing as usual, my husband had the ribeye and I had Japanese wagyu striploin which I highly recommend. For dessert we and the baked Alaska and it was a nice fire show.
I was surprised to see a table with two small children who occasionally made noise as small children do. At this price point and ambiance I'd prefer not to hear babies in the dining room.",3
"It was a amazing time. The waiter I had was very kind, professional, he had respect and you could tell he loved working there. He was always smiling. I could over hear some  of the other waiters as well & they were very polite to their guests. The food was outstanding . So delicious. My boyfriend got the steak and it was exactly how he asked for it, very rich and juicy. I got a burger and it was the best burger I‚Äôve ever tried. It was so juicy, seasoned well, excellent chefs they have!! The hostess was very polite as well as she took our coats to coat check. Amazing experience , definitely will be back.",4
"The ambience was calm and classy, the service was amazing and the food was delicious!",4
Delicious and very special for a special birthday!,4
"The Caesar salad was super salty. Especially my plate because it was the last plate from the pot. They ended up taking it off our bill. 
The wagyu tasting was also salty, and perhaps it would‚Äôve been an okay salt level if I didn‚Äôt have the salad first. The meat was soft and you can taste a difference between the three types of wagyu. 
Service was great, but I felt bad telling them it was salty. I felt like they didn‚Äôt believe me.",1
Amazing experience food was exceptional as was the service!,4
Exceeded our expectations. I couldn't have chosen any other place to celebrate my birthday.,4
"Disappointed.  Server was very unhelpful, did not know anything about allergies.  My wife and I have dietary requirements which most restaurants easily cater to.  Not this one.  The server was aloof, had an attitude and didn't seem to care about our allergies.  He had no knowledge of what we might be able to eat, and didn't do anything to find out information for (such as asking the chef).  Most items on the menu weren't available because they were either out or he didn't know whether they contained gluten.

We were told to view the menu on our phones (?).  What kind of restaurant doesn't bring you a menu?  For $100+ a steak I expect better.  If every single restaurant in Toronto closes down, and this is the only one left, I'll eat at home.",1
"Went to BlueBlood to celebrate a work accomplishment.  This restaurant had been on our bucket list for a while and with pandemic restrictions lifting we took advantage.  First of all the restaurant is beautiful, located in Casa Loma the dining room we were in was stunning with rich details in the woodwork and ceilings.  The tables were nicely spread out to facilitate social distancing and privacy, nice intimate setting.  Service was wonderful from the check-in, our waiter and even the gentleman that prepared our table side ceaser salad (highlight of the meal).  We ordered the dry aged tomahawk steak, mushrooms and fries for our main.  The mushrooms were great, the fries were unremarkable.  The steak was good but maybe I was expecting to be blown away,  I felt a little let down. For dessert we had the creme brulee and it was delicious.  I would definitely say if you've never been give BlueBlood a try for the experience.",2
"Amazing service and ambience.
The crepes are the best!",4
"The food was great but our server Kelly was even better. He can be described as a wizard that orchestrates a memorable experience for his guests. We ordered the table side Caesar salad which was so flavourful, the rib eye from Canada and US wagyu which were both cooked to perfection, and the table side banana crepes were the perfect way to end the meal. So impressed! My fianc√© and I had an amazing time. Thank you Blue Blood & Kelly for a wonderful evening.",4
"It was a fabulous evening, we really love how they set up the library very well spaced out. Service was great and our meals were delicious.",4
We had an amazing time thanks to our server Costa.,4
Awesome and amazing  service from our server forgot his name.,4
Our server Kelly went above and beyond with our service. The food was exceptional. Served at the perfect temperature and perfect time with great recommendations from Kelly. Best steakhouse I‚Äôve been too with great cocktails. Get the lobster pasta as a side & the bitter angel cocktail!,4
Service and ambience were equally amazing would definitely recommend to others.,4
"From the moment we walked it we were treated well.  The table, the service and the ambiance was amazing.  There were plenty of options to choose from.  Our server was amazing and I would highly recommend this restaurant.",4
"Absolutely amazing experience, great food and staff were very kind and attentive.",4
First time at Blue Bloods. Would definitely return! Our server was exceptional and food was perfect. They did a really great job as well with creating a nice and inviting outdoor dining atmosphere.,4
Outstanding service and excellent presentation of food and drinks. Our waiter was just out of this world. Will definitely dine again.,4
"Great experience especially given the times we are in.
We had ample room and weren‚Äôt squeezed in like you might expect in an outdoor setting",4
"I really enjoyed my first time outdoor dining experience. First of all, it was nice and warm which made the experience comfortable. We got started with nice warm cheddar-filled bread rolls. I didn't like the chai butter so much but the rolls were delicious. Our server gave great insights into the menu as well. Our mains came really quickly as well. The sea bass was fresh and tasty. I got the ribeye (medium) and it was a perfect pink. Topped them with mushrooms that were delicious. You could really taste the butter. Overall, pricey but really excellent service.",4
"For the prices they charge, food could do better. The place is beautiful and the attention is outstanding.",2
Excellent!,4
Amazing food. Heated patio was nice and our food and service was amazing!!,4
Thank you. Great food and service! Specual thanks to Kelly,4
"Yes, the waiter was very helpful and friendly. He helped us to make very good choice",4
Amazing ‚Ä¶ will go back,4
"Great environment to bring a date, but the food is overpriced for the quality. Definitely a more for show restaurant in Toronto than quality food.",2
"Went to BlueBlood last night to celebrate our wedding anniversary and it was amazing! From the service, to the scenery and the food we were very happy with our experience and would go back again, next time we are in Toronto!
The patio was enclosed and had heaters so we were very warm‚Ä¶ only hindered the view of the city but we walked around after dinner and got to see a beautiful skyline!",4
"Food was good, not incredible. Caesar salad felt light for 4 people. Seafood tower for 2 people was also light, 4 oysters, 2 shrimps, one lobster tail and a piece of smoked salmon. Sides were small portions. Drinks were fantastic!",3
"Took my wife out for her 50th birthday dinner, and thought that the castle would be a great place. The ambiance was terrific, and the service was great, but the food was moderate. For what you spend, you would think the food would be better. Still, she loved it as the atmosphere was great.",4
Amazing food. The Caesar salad is the best I‚Äôve ever had. The appetizers were amazing too. We had the Wagyu tasting and it was awesome! Prices are normal compared to good steak houses. The place is beautiful too. It feels very exclusive,4
Food are so great and yummy.Thank you Blueblood for giving us one of the best dining experience!,4
"The food is pretty pricey, but the ambience and the quality is worth it. My fiance and I went here for dinner to celebrate our engagement and they even gave us a nice token, which was a very nice touch. The royal cheesecake was easily one of the best cheesecakes that we have tried!",4
"Celebrated my mother's 83rd Birthday. Absolutely amazing service by all.  I needed to make some changes to reservation so I called the number provided by OpenTable.  I was able to speak to Blueblood Reservation Personnel named Sam (lady) and she was absolutely amazing.  She cared to listen and answer all my questions and helped us get a wonderful table that I had requested.  Our server was great;  Geo was very pleasant and knowledgeable.  Service was a bit slower in terms of bussing and refilling water.  Food: Seafood tower was great!  Table Service salad and dessert was fantastic but the Tomahawk Steak (Main) was underdone and chewy.  I was there a week ago and had Bone-in Rib Eye 22oz and it was so amazing that we were leaning towards ordering 2 of those until we were recommended the Tomahawk.  We should have stayed with our original plan.  Tomahawk came already cut so we didn't want to up temp the steak. We finished eating it but my mom didn't end up having much of it.  It was her bday so we didn't say anything but nonetheless it was a pleasant night.  We ended up loving everything but the the main.  Nonetheless, we had a great time celebrating mom's birthday.",3
"It was a wonderful experience but not for ""light pockets"". You get what you pay for. Every meal was well plated. Steak was as desired. Place for special occasions",4
"Overall great service once again. Sergio was super attentive, friendly and always had great conversation. Always a great night when we are able to come to blueblood!",4
It was the perfect place to ring in the New Year. I look forward to visiting again. Luxury to a great standard.,4
A very low level service at a high end restaurant. Servers were trying to rush the order and didn‚Äôt ask for dessert. Server at this restaurant shows very rude behaviour. We complained to the manager as well and her response was she can‚Äôt do anything about it. I would rather go somewhere else where i get better service for what i pay. Very disappointed on new year‚Äôs night.,1
"I went there for the NYE dinner, it was really pleasant and absolutely worth the time and service. Highly recommend!",4
"So unfortunately we had a bad experience at this restaurant. My wife and I typically share our food so we both got 2 different steaks. We ordered our steaks done Medium. When we received our steaks they were medium rare. They tried to explain to us that is what a medium is considered in their restaurant but they would gladly refire our steaks. By doing that in a rush they burnt the hell out of our steaks causing the crust to be bitter. We normally would have ordered our steaks medium rare but my wife is pregnant and thus cannot eat meat under 140 degrees f. 135 f is medium rare. The restaurant did not even have the manager come over to apologize for our bad experience he was on his phone half the time just walking back from room to room and passed us by three times, nor which normally steakhouses do is to make us a new one which typically normal steakhouses would do. By the time our burnt steaks came back our sides were stone cold. Typically a voucher or request to return to the restaurant would have been presented by the wait staff or Management but it was not. Management needs to visit real steakhouses like Hy's, Jacob's or Morton's to see what it's like for a true steakhouse experience. We will not be returning or recommending this restaurant at all.",1
"TOTALLY different experience and review from my first visit Dec 11th . Hostess tried to sit us at a really crappy table in an almost empty room . Waited in the middle of the dining room almost 15 minutes while she checked to see if she could move us . Finally sat by the manager . Waited an additional 10 minutes for a menu and a server . Same server as my first visit but this time he was WAY off his ‚Äú game‚Äù. Food was mediocre at best they screwed up my salad and my boyfriend‚Äôs seafood tasted frozen . The menu is lacking variety for a non meat eater . The servers station is located directly in the dining room so the sound of clattering plates and  falling silver ware is intolerable . Babies screaming and dishes assaulting my ears and they fell to the ground repeatedly was all just a bit much ! Bottom line , I‚Äôve had my ‚Äú Cinderella ‚Äú experience , shoulda stopped after the first time . Seriously NO reason to ever go back and pay THAT kinda money to be aggravated especially on New Year‚Äôs Eve !",1
"As soon as we got to the restaurant they said it was last call,and we were being rushed the whole time",1
"Our server, donaldo, made for a fun and interactive experience.  He was great and made the night!",4
The steaks are amazing as always. This time we sat in the Billiards room which we really liked. The service from everyone was amazing.,4
"Exquisitely prepared food, exceptional service and an elegant but comfortable ambience, Blue Blood is the perfect place for dropping a big wad of cash on a special occasion.  Not cheap, but definitely worth every penny.",4
"Amazing food, service and experience!",4
"It wasn‚Äôt a bad night, just not what we expect from a high end restaurant.  Except for the sommelier who went out of his way to be helpful.",2
Great resto. There's plenty of food options and a lot of them are truly delicious. I highly recommend their Japanese Wagyu. It's great for a date night or an outing with some friends.,4
"We had dinner reservations for 9:30. Thankfully we arrived earlier. we were told we had to place our food & drink orders immediately. After our first drink was delivered our waiter told us it was last call. We were forced to order our last drink without finishing the first. I traveled to Toronto specifically to celebrate my birthday there. The best of our experience was our host, Alex. He apologized for the rushed service. I understand the rules and regulations the government has put into place. The restaurant should have also taken this into consideration when taking reservations.",1
"Hands down the best restaurant I‚Äôve ever been to, the restaurant was absolutely beautiful. I‚Äôve never seen anything like it before. Definitely won‚Äôt be the last time I plan a special occasion at BlueBlood.",4
"Great food, great ambience, great service. The Christmas charm only added to the experience.",4
"Service was very good 
Food was a great disappointment 
Fish was fishy, steak was dry and overcooked 
Lamb was fatty
Broccolini was fridge cold
Crab fritters had a pinch of crab, raw in the middle 
Over waiter was extremely nice and attentive",2
"Everyone was awesome, special attention to us on our anniversary, we love it here and appreciate the fine food, options and service",4
Lovely experience!  Slightly overpriced however.  Ceaser salad for 2 was $44 plus tip and tax on that.  It was amazing however it was still lettuce with dressing.  Steak was very tasty.  Desserts were phenomenal!  Salmon was perfectly cooked.  Definitely plan for at least a $550-$650 bill for 4 people.  Service was excellent!,3
My boyfriends first time here - he loved it so much it‚Äôs worth every penny,4
"I loved everything about this place. The food, ambiance and service was amazing!",4
Food was good. Staff wasn't attentive. Our server mixed up our order for dessert which caused extra long wait and didn't even apologize for the mistake.,2
"Christmas Day was special at Bluebloods. We had a great experience with great food, service and atmosphere. Highly recommend",4
"Saw previous reviews and being Casa Loma, I had high expectations. Unfortunately, was quite disappointed with food. Mediocre at best.",2
We had the best time to celebrate Christmas Eve. Has become our favourite spot in the city and can‚Äôt wait to be back once things reopen. Thank you to the staff too that was outstanding.,4
The steak was hard and has no flavor whatsoever!,2
"Service and food was incredible.
Not everyday you can eat a great steak dinner in a castle!",4
The food was delicious. It would have been nice to have a second glass of wine but our waiter did not come by the table again until the end of the meal. That‚Äôs really the only ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù but otherwise we all enjoyed the meal and atmosphere,4
Great atmosphere and amazing drinks and steak.  A must-try place for all.,4
Amazing experience! Isaac was our server and he was awesome! Great food/great atmosphere!,4
"This was a Birthday Dinner and it was fantastic! From the moment we were seated to the very end, the experience was perfect.",4
Caesar salad is a must.  Best I have ever had.  Expensive meal but great for a special occasion.  Service was impeccable and cool vibe.,4
Amazing service followed through with a perfectly executed meal!! Highly recommend!,4
"The experience in dining at Blueblood steakhouse is phenomenal. The service is excellent, everyone is helpful in our needs, and they cater and make sure your every need in dining is met. The food is extraordinary, even with the simple salad, it taste perfect. I will gladly recommend this restaurant and for sure will come back here to dine.",4
"We thought we were in for an enchanted evening going to this restaurant around the holidays. Since it is located inside Casa Loma the atmosphere was everything that could be expected especially with all the beautiful decorations. All was going well until the bottle of wine arrived- it was corked & the wine sommelier said  perhaps once it‚Äôs decanted it should be fine. Informed her we are owners of a 10,000 bottle cellar, so she did
replace it with a fresh bottle that was delicious. Next the table next to us was seated- a family with a young child in her pajamas who ended up barefoot-hard to believe a restaurant of this caliber would allow this. Then lastly the dinner arrived-both of us ordered lamp chops, flavor was nice but they were very tough. Way too many excellent restaurants in Toronto to ever come back to this one.",0
Birthday Celebration,4
"Celebrated a dual Birthday last night with friends. We were seated in the Library. Our table was perfect! The ambiance of the room was spectacular! The food was delicious, however the true gem of the night was our fabulous waiter Conner! Thank you Conner for making our night memorable!",4
Had an amazing time at BlueBlood. The staff were attentive and extraordinary and the food was delicious.,4
Spectacular festive atmosphere in a magical setting,4
"Costly... but brilliant atmosphere, and service.

I recommend getting: the Shrimp Cocktail (served with dry ice); the table-side Caesar (a show for your salad); and the Banana Crepes, and Baked Alaska (served tableside... with fire!)",4
We went for a date night and found that everything was delicious. Our server was very attentive and the table side experience with the Caesar Salad was great. Will definitely return!,3
The ombiance you will never beat. The food is pricy and to be expected but the quality is not there 3 of the 4 steaks we ordered were tasty but tough and the steak knives not sharp. Caesar salad made at the table was amazing but the service slow received the cheque and waited 20 min for the server to show up again with the machine to pay.,2
"Excellent night with our dear friends, meal, ambiance, Christmas in the Castle was outstanding. Thanks to Donaldo for treating us like family. Merry Christmas.",4
"The food, service, and room were outstanding. We can‚Äôt thank Donaldo, our server, enough. He was attentive, accommodating, and knowledgeable. Our dinner experience was fantastic.",4
We had a magical evening at Casa Loma. Food was spectacular and service was fantastic,4
"We had an amazing experience last night. The atmosphere and service far exceeded our expectations! 
A special thanks  goes to Connor for making it all happen.",4
"Stuart took excellent care of our party of 4.

My only negative comment was redoing the bill when asking for a top up to one coffee - for a $1500 bill- of an extra $5. 
That was a very cheap cheesy move.",4
We really enjoyed our dinner at Blublood steakhouse. Awesome service by Lucas. I recommend this restaurant to everyone,4
"I would never come here again or any restaurant associated with the Liberty group unless I want to cry on my birthday again. They do not know how to run a professional establishment. Where to begin:

PAINFUL RESERVATION PROCESS:
It took me over a week of calling them, multiple phone messages left unanswered, contacting through instagram, in order to get a hold if a human. I left a review at that stage, which prompted a call back finally which was my aim and I took it down right after. Their insta person gave the name of the room I wanted so I was able to book for it online, as it's not clear which room is which. I got a call after that from a nice and very professional man called Samuel who told me to book through him in future because their online booking system has issues, I asked for a specific table by the window overlooking the whole restaurant and he confirmed all was booked for the billiard room.

RESERVATION MESS UP and STAFF THAT DON'T SEEM LIKE THEY CARE:
I get there and they try to take us to a different room, they all look at us blankly didn‚Äôt apologize and are like we will see what we can do but aren't really clear if anything can be done when I explain the length I went through to book at Casa Loma in that specific room and table for my birthday. At this stage I am already rather upset due to my extensive campaign to get that specific reservation and their casual demeanor.

The manager, an asian lady, comes and seems blas√©, she didn't appear particularly apologetic and said that they gave my 3/4 person table to a 2 person group because they came before us. Apparently there wasn't a note on my reservation that they saw. There was a 2 person table right beside them at the same window which we couldn‚Äôt sit at now cause it was too small. Most restaurants seat 2 people at a two person table when they are a busy place so this in and of itself was weird. She basically said we could sit at another table without the view that also looked reserved for others alr",0
Just absolutely amazing food and drink. Dax our server was amazing and took care of us all evening. He even put on a show for us when we ordered the table side Baked Alaska.,4
"The food, staff and ambiance was amazing! Highly recommend for special occasions.",4
Great service and delicious food! Especially profiteroles for dessert‚Ä¶,4
"The setting was unbelievable, wow dinner in a castle, the service was impeccable and the food was perfect, I‚Äôve found steaks in a restaurant leave something to be desired but I can‚Äôt say this about the Blue Blood! The steaks were beyond reproach done to a tee and likely the best I‚Äôve had! Looking forward to our next visit üòéüëçüòâ ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è",4
Excellent service fantastic food and wine! Most impressive is menu mentions provide or state your protein comes from.  Sustainability at its finest. Wine list is amazing varieties Desert was exquisite,4
Blueblood steakhouse was a wonderful experience. The food (although a bit pricey) was absolutely amazing! The dining area was absolutely beautiful and the wait staff was so nice! My date and I felt like royalty while we dined.,4
"Food is amazing, this was our second time eating here; we will definitely be back again! Love the location and the staff are so friendly and made this such a wonderful experience.",4
"It was an incredible experience! 
My husband and I had a wonderful time, the restaurant is so beautiful. Connor provided us with such amazing service and everyone we met was very friendly and helpful.",4
We had a great experience at blue blood! Super upset that I don‚Äôt remember our servers name but he was absolutely wonderful!,4
It was my birthday and the waiters were AMAZING shoutout to (Dex or Dan i don‚Äôt know but it starts with a D) you were so funny and kept  us laughing all night!,4
Incredible experience ! Already reserved fir four more occasions ! This is my new fav in Toronto ! My boyfriend and I had a magical experience !,4
"David was our server, he was absolutely wonderful. Went out for my birthday, felt like royalty at the restaurant. And like a said David our server was an absolute Gem! Wonderful service and delicious food.",4
"Beautiful venue very nicely decorated for the holidays. Food was nothing special and priced very high! Annoying that you must pay $15 for parking. Good service. Was very cold if seated by windows in the dining room and seating for tables of 2 is not very comfortable and awkward to dine in along the front bay windows. 

Definitely can find better steakhouses for the $$ in the city.",2
"We ordered Canadian triple A steaks and they were good, but not to the level of other fine steakhouses in the city. For the price, we were surprised to find the steak just good, rather than excellent. Cannot comment about the other steaks.

Other dishes were excellent, and service was excellent and friendly. Table side Caesar salad and Baked Alaska were highlights. We were in the library and the ambience was of course beautiful.",3
"The food was absolutely delicious, we had the wagyu fillet tasting which was a perfect way to experience the difference in taste of wagyu from different parts of the world, and the table side ceasar salad was perfect.
The only ding on experience was there was a cold draft coming from the windows on this particular windy night, and the chairs were a bit hard to get comfortable in. But the service was excellent, the food top notch, and what can I say except dining in a castle is an experience all its own... 
Fantastic dinner",3
Unbelievably unforgettable experience. Will be back.,4
Food was incredible.  You get what you pay for!  We sat outside where our reservations were made on the terrace.  It was warm.  Service was top notch!,4
We enjoyed our dinner very much.  That is because the food was great and we were served very well.,4
Connor was amazing,4
"Food was amazing, the service and ambiance was top notch!
Would definitely recommend this restaurant.",4
"I got the sea bass, the missus got the Cornish hen. Both are great. Go easy on the sides because you‚Äôll be full just from the dishes .",4
"Excellent experience overall. Special mention to Donale, our server, who went above and beyond. Out celebrating our belated anniversary.",4
"I wasn‚Äôt amazed by the food, but the service is excellent.",2
The service is great the food is excellent there is definitely no complaint waiters are extremely nice,4
"Probably my favourite meal I have ever had out!  Wow! The food, the ambience and the staff are incredible!  The table side Caesar was delicious and entertaining!  Vito and Andrew were the most gracious and wonderful servers.  Vito made us feel so important and like we were his only table!  Thank you!",4
"Amazing attention to service detail from the parking lot and back. The steaks my gSon and I had were cooked perfectly, the fries were like giant potato trees and desserts rich and delicious. 
But it was the amazing level of service that blew us away. Attentive, friendly, professional and caring in a fun environment. So good on every level!",4
"Overall, We enjoyed our time at Blueblood Steakhouse at Casa Loma. The food was absolutely delicious, the service incredible! The noise level was too loud for us, we had a hard caring on conversation at times!",3
BlueBlood was a super venue for a special celebration for my daughters birthday. We loved the location and ambiance and Trevor was a great waiter. $$$$ but we knew that going there and we most definitely will return!!,4
"Great ambience, service and food! Loved the decor for the holidays too.",4
"Great food‚Ä¶ steaks were awesome, sides are ok. Highly recommend the Caesar salad and the baked Alaska",4
"Had a fantastic dinner celebrating my husband‚Äôs birthday.  Stuart was a great waiter - attentive, polite and funny.  We had a nice evening.  Bringing the family back in a few weeks.",4
"My wife and I were visiting Toronto from Texas for a long birthday weekend and I selected BlueBlood Steakhouse as my 45th birthday dinner destination based on reviews, their menu, and the historic Casa Loma back drop of the restaurant. We started with sparkling water and bottle of Stratus. We proceeded to have the oysters as an appetizer which were excellent and then ordered their signature caesar salad which was prepared and mixed table side. My wife had the USDA ribeye, medium rare, and I had the Wagyu sampling, medium rare, with a Nova Scotia lobster tail. Everything arrived at the perfect temperature and were absolutely delicious! We finished our meal with the vanilla bean creme br√ªl√©e with cappuccino for my wife and two triple espressos for myself. Alex was our server and was attentive to all of our needs and provided a stellar customer service and dining experience. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone searching for an exceptional dining experience!",4
"Kelly was our server and he was awesome! Very fast and efficient, and had excellent recommendations!",4
Everything was great ‚Ä¶ service food and ambience. Ate too much it was so good,4
The experience was amazing. I‚Äôm from Edmonton Alberta and came to toronto to do a bodybuilding competition and I know I will be back for my next toronto show. Thank you for the amazing time and I hope more of my friends get to come and enjoy this experience,4
"Not only is the food superb, the service and ambiance are beyond anything you can expect. It‚Äôs not just dinner- it‚Äôs a full experience. From the knowledgeable in house sommelier to the excellent service staff that make you feel like royalty. Kelly, specifically who has only been there for 9 days was one of the best servers we have ever had. It was our anniversary and he hand wrote a card for us and gave us a souvenir of Casa Loma and Bluebloods to keep. The steak (we had the 38 day aged tomahawk) was the best steak I‚Äôve ever had and the tables banana crepes were out of this world. Worth every penny. You will leave here feeling like royalty. It‚Äôs not just a wonderful meal, it would be a beautiful experience.",4
"Absolutely unreal. The food was amazing and the service was perfect. Of course the setting was incredibly being situated right inside Casa Loma. The sommelier was so knowledgable and friendly, and our waiter was wonderful. Although pricy, this is a perfect spot to celebrate a special occasion and worth every penny.",4
"It‚Äôs difficult to out into words the experience one has at this restaurant at Casa Loma. From the greeting at the door, our waiter, Denaldo, and all the  staff, make you feel like royalty.  After all you, are eating at a castle! The food was delicious. Especially the table side ceaser salad, Scallops, lobster Mac and cheese and even the appetizer French fries.   Will go back again for sure.",4
The appetizer arrived on a dirty plate and caviar was missing.The server was alerted and replaced the appetizer. Sides for the main course were given to the wrong people. Two steaks were ordered medium rare but one was served medium and the other rare. In spite  of these mistakes an 18% gratuity was added to the bill by the server.,2
"Tent was a little cold, even with sweaters on but otherwise the meal and service was great.",3
The service was great and the portions were very generous.,4
Everything was outstanding! Definitely want to try Don Alfonso,4
Kelly did a great job and we were happy with his attentiveness,4
Had the best service from our server Kelly!!!!!!!!,4
This place is great for a date night we dinned in Library room however would recommend the Oak or Billiards instead it‚Äôs a better setup. Our server was outstanding. It‚Äôs definitely very pricey.,3
The food was absolutely delicious. We had the shrimp cocktail and steaks. It was my cousin's 19th birthday and they gave him a birthday card and a cute souvenir of Casa Loma and BlueBlood as a wine cork. It was a very nice experience.,4
"The ambiance and service was fantastic. The setting is beautiful. I purchased a $100 steak it was no where near worth that. The Keg has better steaks for way way less.
For two of us the bill including tip was $340. Not worth it. 
I have been to many fine steak houses. i will not return to Blue Bloods",3
Excellent!,4
I booked Blueblood for a romantic date. I have been there before and really enjoyed it. We were not seated in the main restaurants dining room we were seated in another room that basically looked like a few tables and chairs were thrown into the room to accommodate more people. It was not the elegant and classy experience we were expecting from dining at Casa Loma. The service was extremely slow and the whole ambiance was lost. The food was great but we came to experience romance in a beautiful restaurant and instead we felt like we were in a makeshift cafeteria. It was not worth the money we spent. Had I known this is where we would be seated I would not have gone there.,1
"Elegant, great service, incredible food, and an absolutely memorable evening!",4
Excellent food and service. Food came out quickly and tasted very fresh. Ambiance was great - dimly lit and perfect for a romantic dinner or special occasion.,4
The food is amazing!,4
What an exceptional venue for an evening out. There can't be many places like Casa Loma world wide to enjoy a dinner. Staff were attentive and accommodating. Food was of the highest calibre.,4
It was really good vibes and the food was good too. The baked alaska was the icing on the cake literally.,3
Good choice for nice dinner or birthday celebration,3
Kelly went above and beyond for my birthday dinner. We will be back again.,4
"The table close to us had very loud diners on them. Since it was a business meal, I did not want to appear like a jerk by calling that out. 

The menu when looked on the phone, is tedious to look at. If you are taking away all the menus, then at least publish the online menu as easy to read on the phone. 

The steak which I ordered, did not deserve the price tag it carried. 

Drinks are super expensive but it seems like on one knows how to make a decent Old Fashioned",1
"The server was amazing, very knowledgeable, the food was good but unfortunately I felt uncomfortable due to next table was like literally 2feet next to me, hard to keep conversations without hearing the next table over you. But besides that, good atmosphere. Beautiful place",3
"Great experience overall! Our waiter, Costa, was so helpful and made sure we were well taken care of. We'll definitely be back!",4
"In all a great experience. Staff is really nice and professional!!!
I recommend!",4
"We visited Bluebloods to celebrate my birthday. I would recommend going here to celebrate a special occasion! Food was great, and Casa Loma always delivers on the ambiance. The table decor was a little plain and $15 for parking on site when you spend thousands on dinner is a little cheap. Overall great experience and would recommend visiting.",3
"Went there to celebrate my husband birthday. Lucas was our server and he ensured we had a great time. He was friendly and patient with the kids. Overall experience was phenomenal, we will be returning again.",4
Anniversary,4
"The whole experience was amazing! The food was delicious and presentation was top notch. The service we received from our waiter Kelly was classy, attentive and his attention to detail was second to none. He truly took the experience to the next level. We would definitely go back in a heartbeat!

I would like to add to my initial review. When I got home I realized I was charged for something we never had. I called them the same night and for now almost two weeks straight with ABSOLUTELY no response. I would like to go back but this experience after is really deterring me from going.",0
Delicious food and exceptional service. Great for a special occasion. Excellent selection of non-alcoholic drinks.,4
Thank you Oliver for your great service and help with the table I appreciate everyone that served us last night,4
Food was good but not for the value. Pricey for average dishes.,2
"We had a wonderful time celebrating my husband‚Äôs birthday last night. Our server, Ian, was lovely and very helpful. He gave us great suggestions for our meal along with some drinks.",4
"A fantastic restaurant for my sons 25th Birthday Celebration we had a lovely meal, everything was perfectly prepared. The bottle of wine and drinks were overpriced for sure, but Connor was our main server and  he was excellent!",4
"Great restaurant and ambiance. Service was top notch. Depending on where you are seated, the table side salad or crepe‚Äôs aren‚Äôt really table side. Had the aged Canadian rib eye steak and was good, but not great. Would recommend it for a one time experience, but unlikely to return.",3
"Bluebloods was perfect for my parents anniversary. The Oak Room is very special and intimate with a lot of character. Dax was our dedicated server and he was superb! Knowledgeable, helpful and funny! 

We ordered a bunch of different things from apps, salads, different cuts of steaks and sides. The baked Alaska was the perfect way to end the meal. We got a private mini tour of a few Casaloma rooms and enjoyed the outdoor light exhibit for the holidays. 

I will be back for sure. I want to try the seafood tower and the table side Caesar salad and chopped salad were too delish not to have again.",4
Love. Most beautiful spot.,4
Excellent service and dining experience.  Food was amazing!,4
Excellent service!!!,4
"such a great spot, best place to celebrate a special occasion!",4
"You made my wife‚Äôs birthday amazing last night. Our server, Donalde, was incredible and gave excellent recommendations. Would definitely suggest the rack of lamb and the profiterole (as well as the steak of course!). Great place for a special event - thanks so much!",4
"Food was delicious but pricey, noise level was a bit much due to a birthday party, our server was not the friendliest and was a bit abrupt with us.",3
We had a phenomenal anniversary dinner there. Not very many options for vegetarians but my wife was gracious and knew I wanted to try the A5 filet. Great service and the dining room is beautiful. Wonderful cocktails too as we just didnt feel like wine. Definitely worth the visit.,4
Service was outstanding! Visited with my ten year old son and the staff treated him like a king. And the food...wow! I‚Äôll never be able to eat steak at a known chain restaurant again. Soooo good. Thank you for such a memorable night ‚ô•Ô∏è,4
Best dining. Thoughtful staff. Delicious food. Everyone is so sweet.,4
Best Restaurant in Toronto. Food and service are amazing!,4
Amazing food and ambience. We went to celebrate our anniversary and it was total worth every dollar spent.,4
"This was one of the most magical experiences I have ever had at a restaurant - it is truly an experience fit for royalty. Not only was the food and atmosphere incredible but, our server Kelly made the night as incredible as it was. He anticipated all of our needs, was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. Even though he told us it was second day on the job, it felt like he had been working there for years. They even gave me a birthday present. Truly would recommend it to anyone.",4
Food was fantastic Kelly was our server and it was his first day and we had no idea until he told us. Fantastic meal,4
Kelly was an amazing server would love to come back he was very attentive.,4
"Delicious food, great ambience and impeccable service. Definitely worth treating yourself at Blue Blood",4
"Beautiful restaurant, great atmosphere and our waiter and all staff were very friendly and helpful!",4
"Went to Blueblood Steakhouse yesterday for a birthday and had dinner on the patio. With the weather being 6 degrees, I was originally worried that it might be too cold for dining outside however it was fully covered with multiple heaters! I was able to take off my jacket and sit comfortable with no gust of wind or worry. My server Issac was nothing but Legendary. He provided amazing service being knowledgeable, considerate, attentive and very welcoming.  We started off with two dozen oysters which came quite quickly as we sat down. For an early entree we did the wagyu filet tasting which was perfectly cooked but out of the 3 type of Wagyu, I definitely prefer the Kagoshima A5 Japanese. For the main entree we did the Waygu Tomahawk. I didn‚Äôt see it on the menu but went with Issac‚Äôs recommendation. 
It took about 20 minutes to come out but with such an expensive steak, there is no complaints on my end as I want to make sure they cook it properly and the didn‚Äôt disappoint. The steak was cooked to perfection! My only complaint was the meat was a bit fatty.. waygu in general is very marbleized but this steak had a lot of fat.. I guess it also makes the steak juicy and mouth watering.. no regrets on my end as I wanted to try for the experience. 
Overall atmosphere, bathroom, facility was clean and tidy, staff was uniformed and consistent and the overall night was a 5 star experience. 

Note* they also remembered it was my girlfriends birthday and gave her a little gift. I appreciated the hospitality!",4
Absolutely incredible - went to celebrate a promotion and the staff went above and beyond. Food was to die for and the portions are very generous. Can't wait to go back!,4
"This was our first time at Bluebloods and we loved it!! Everything from the Valet to the service and food was outstanding. The birthday gift was such a nice surprise!! Oscar was our server and he was so helpful at explaining the different options to us.
We will definitely return!
The Banana Crepe was an awesome experience!!!",4
"Amazing food as always.  Sides need to up their game, but the steaks are as always amazing!",4
"It was great and our waiter was wonderful.
The food was exceptional!",4
It‚Äôs was great ‚Ä¶ I love the service it was my husband birthday and they went out and beyond for him .. they don‚Äôt serve truffle butter and our server went out his way to go to a next restaurant to get that ‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt expect that at all.. and I loved it I didn‚Äôt catch his name but thank you,3
"Fantastic overall. Split a PEI ribeye which was exceptional with side spinach and Caesar salad Marr table side.   The steak was overcooked however, we asked for medium rare and it was closer to medium well.",4
The food and service is amazing here. The beef Wellington and grilled octopus was mouth watering. The drinks were also delicious!,4
"The overall experience was great, the food was good, and The servers were super friendly and social. If you have the server Kelly, get ready for great service.",4
"For the price this was just okay.  Steak was excellent but lobster bisque and wagyu carpaccio was meh. Service was very off and not would you would expect of a restaurant of this caliber.  I won‚Äôt go again.  If you want ambiance, it‚Äôs cool but if you want food, don‚Äôt go here.",3
Best food I‚Äôve had in my life. It is very worth the high prices.,4
The aura and ambiance of Cas‚Äôs Lima was negated by the tent on the terrace that we were seated in. My appetiter consisting of gravolax was amazing but what followed was not what I expected-a naked piece of filet on a steel plate- no sauce no vegetation to keep the carnivore company at least not until the broccoli and mushrooms  much later the ice cream and coffee which followed we‚Äôre sweet though not fully appreciated by its young patron,2
"We had a fantastic time at Bluebloods. Our waiter Dex was outstanding, and made our experience wonderful. Thank you Dex for making our anniversary so special.",4
Absolutely first class and in our top 10 list of restaurants in Canada!! We had the most  wonderful dinner and such attention all the way through. Can't miss the Steak Tartare served in Bone Marrow or the Alaskan Crab Fritters. Very much enjoyed the Short Rib Wellington as part of our Mains - just wow! Cocktail experience highly recommended is the Once Upon a Time! It's like a Cigar and Whiskey experience at the same time.,4
Our waiter was super knowledgeable and served us with great professionalism. Felt very well taken care of. Thanks Ian,4
After many months not socializing due to covid we finally went out to celebrate my moms bday at BlueBlood!  The food and ambiance was was five star but best of all was the stellar service we enjoyed! Ian our server took such special care in making sure we felt comfortable and helped make our evening and experience a memorable one! We look forward to returning again soon!,4
Simply magnificent! Great experience.,4
Amazing food and excellent service ! For sure we will be back,3
"Food was delicious, great service. Would change the breadbasket to sourdough!",3
"Gio are server was amazing very amazing
The food was delicious Martinis where superb
Overall was great",4
Great Wagyu Steak. Wasn‚Äôt a fan of Alaskan desert though,4
Amazing place to spend our 11year anniversary. This Resturant made us feel very special even gave us a a note and souvenir to take home for our special day! Loved every minute of it and will cherish it forever. Thank for such a lovely and memorable evening ‚ô•Ô∏è,4
Our service was the best.  Thank you so much for your amazing work,4
"Steak was delicious (wagyu tasting), sides tasty but basic (asparagus, broccolini, whipped potatoes), service was fantastic (Vito is amazing), appetizers and dessert very good, epic setting/ambience.  Did the escape room across the road after dinner then came back for drinks at the bar.  Great night!",4
Excellent food and service was extremely attentive! Would highly recommend this restaurant.,4
"Excellent meal, service was impeccable. Will be back!",4
"Andy was an absolute rockstar of a server. He was courteous, friendly, attentive to all our needs and requests. He is also extremely knowledgeable about the history of Casa Loma. I can't recall ever receiving such excellent service. It was my first time dining there but certainly won't be my last!",4
Definitely a great place to host special events. The food and value is amazing and the service was fantastic,4
"We celebrated a birthday with six professional women who are all passionate carnivores. It was a wonderful time. with great food, wine, service. We especially enjoyed the service details of the evening - the preparation of the at table cesear salad, the lovely wine decanter, the picture of Prince!! All Terrific. Thank you.",4
Good Birthday venue,3
"On arrival we were greeted by a host I believe named Josit but could be corrected.  Oh dear, this persons attitude made the evening not start well.  
No smile, no eye contact, jumped down our throat when we explained our vaccine Is Albertan it will not scan.  She was very rude considering we were about to drop a fair amount of money on a dinner.  We were early and told to go wait outside, I expressed my unhappiness by saying wow customer service is great here, not.  She yelled behind us like a spoilt child.  This can never be called fine dining if you employ stroppy staff with attitude.  When we returned for our table there were 3 different hosts who were very friendly, I asked them the name of the girl who we first spoke to and I‚Äôm sure they said josit.
The meal was lovely, our waiter was friendly and attentive and my husbands birthday was enjoyable but our first impression wasn‚Äôt good.  I expect more.  Oh and the online bill isn‚Äôt ours we spent $600 not $121",3
Lovely steak and service,3
"My husband and I had our 1year anniversary dinner here. The food was exceptional, I highly recommend the wagyu filet tasting! The staff, especially Gio was excellent and they also gifted us a blue blood wine stopper! Gio went above and beyond to make our fist experience memorable! We‚Äôll definitely be back soon!",4
"Keep up the great work! Personal opinion, prefer too have the sides included instead of a la carte.",4
"Feast, enjoy, and indulge. Loved it. Food was perfection. Drinks amazing. Service impeccable.",4
"Our server, Donaldo was really great, super friendly, answered all of our questions in detail to help us order what to eat and understand how things were done. He made us feel special and truly took care of us.",4
"The waiter was very rude during our visit, their was a mistake on the bill as well which he made us feel guilty about reviewing until he realized we were in fact correct. Not sure shat the issue was but he definitely ruined the mood for our birthday dinner. Really disappointed.",0
"The ambience is excellent.  The food was a bit hit or miss, some was great and some average.  As a result of the high prices for drinks and food I didn't think it was a great value.  For three drinks, two appetizers, two sides and two steaks the bill came to mid $400 and we chose the lower-mid priced steaks.

The Once Upon A Time drink was spectacular.  

Service was mostly good; a tad slow at times, but some presentations of the food enhanced the experience.

Overall, if you have cash to spare I'd recommend it.  I am choosing not recommending to a friend because most of my friends would not want to pay this amount of money for a dinning experience.",2
"This was probably one of the best dining experiences I have ever had in Toronto and even in other cities. All the staff were excellent. Our server Dax was superb and provided amazing service throughout our whole night, he was very welcoming and knew the menu very well. We tried everything he suggested and were not disappointed. We will definitely be going back. The food was absolutely delicious!",4
"The atmosphere and food was amazing. Service was incredible. Would high recommend. 
Pretty expensive but worth every penny.",4
"Definitely a spot to try! Service was immaculate, everyone was amazing. Seafood tower & the wine was our favourite food-wise. My bf can make a better steak (totally just our preference he is an amazing cook haha) other then that will definitely be back! Thank you so much for a wonderful date night :)",4
"Amazing service on all levels. Gorgeous room, including the beautiful Prince painting. The food was incredible. Great experience.",4
What a fantastic restaurant! The meal was fantastic. There was a small issue and it was rectified immediately and comped on our bill. Definitely would recommend this place for a special event.,4
"The food was very bad. We ordered the crab fritter (assumed it was a crab cake).  Came with 3 balls. The balls were over fried and were dark brown colour. We had to use a lot of effort to cut the ball in half because it was so hard. The center was cold!!  The texture and taste were like fallalel balls.  The steak was sooo overpriced. We ordered an aged steak 45 days from what I recall.  It was NOT aged.  The steak tartare was mediocre. The lobster bisque was a lobster broth, lacking in the creamy texture.  With those things said, I would only come back for the cocktails!!  So impressed by the cocktails and I would come back only for cocktails.",1
The place is impeccable. The food is great and the service is excellent.,4
"The food are awesome, the price and the quality of food are worth it.",4
Service was great no concerns about it. The foods/ beverages are way overprice for the size and taste compare to other steakhouse I have been. No dress code restrictions applied few customers were under dress for a classy restaurant which kind of ruin the ambience. Chair was uncomfortable for 2 seater (tufted leather ) I see people struggling including ourself to move our hands freely. Overall experience was unsatisfactory.,2
Very nice service was great and friendly. I just didn‚Äôt like a picture of Prince hanging over the fireplace. It doesn‚Äôt suit the time of the Casa Loma mansion. I think a photo of the man at lived there or built it would be more accurate,4
This is hands down the best restaurant in the city. Far better than comparative restaurants such as harbour 60. The ambiance is unparalleled and the food is completely mind blowing on top of it. We‚Äôve been here twice and both times it‚Äôs been the more incredible experience. I will be dreaming about the gorgonzola gnocchi and the truffle potatoes for months,4
"We ate here , nice place great service fantastic place to visit 
Quite pricy , delicious meal we had AAA canadian serlion done perfectly 
Way to salty for me tho ..wife liked it 
Big portions ,as I am a big eater we were full 
 4 stars for us 
For after we bought tickets for the horror Halloween Walk though the tunnels underground and on the property 
Excellent,  we'll done",3
"Does this place do anything wrong? No. The answer is definitely not. The food was incredible, the wine selection impeccable, service was outstanding and the noise levels were actually very moderate to low. The barriers between the booths were enough to block out sound yeah and the seating was extremely comfortable",4
Ian from blue blood was awesome! Wagyu tasting was phenomenal,4
"I booked this reservation about a week in advance for my girlfriend‚Äôs birthday. Two days before the reservation I called to inform the hostess of my girlfriend‚Äôs olive allergy. 
When we arrived at your establishment, I accidentally went into the wrong parking entrance. When I tried to ask the attendant for help he cursed at me so I cursed back at him and proceeded to the correct entrance. 
In restaurant, when the appetizers came out my girlfriend tried to confirm with the waiter who brought over the food if they were aware of the allergy to olives. But before she could ask the person ran away. The matre d (sic) came to apologize saying that the olive allergy was confused as a ‚Äúalmond‚Äù allergy. When our main courses came out, our steaks were given to us incorrectly so we both were forced to try each other‚Äôs food before having our plates switched around. Once again the matre d‚Äô(sic) came and apologized and said that we would get free dessert. When the bill came to me I was still charged for dessert. 
To say the least, this experience does not meet my standard of a fining dining experience. I hope you can do better for other couples trying to enjoy a special occasion. It was odd because I was looking around I didn‚Äôt see any other table having the problems we were having. I do think I will be returning to your establishment.

"Everything was just as we expected 
We had an amazing time",4
"The actual Steak House seating area has a wonderful ambience, however, we were placed in a large reception room which lacked that element. The setting is nice in general, but the room is not designed as a dining area, its more condusive to a banquet hall. This was a disappointment given our choice to celebrate an important day for our family.  Had I known ahead I would have chosen to go to another retaurant.
On the positive the food and service was excellent.",3
Everything was great. We were a group of 8 with kids and the server was excellent. Dessert was a little slow but worth the wait.,4
"Staff were really on the ball. Love the round tables. The leather Seats were so soft and comfy.
Octopus appetizer a must!
Onions rings - don‚Äôt bother
Wagyu Japanese Ribeye - amazing!
Hamburger was cold.
Fries were really good as well as the mashed potatoes.",4
"I went here for my anniversary with my partner and it was an exciting and romantic experience! I loved the ambiance and the setting - the castle was gorgeous and although we dined outdoors and the plastic covering surrounding us was somewhat blurring our view of the city and garden, overall the atmosphere was warm and elegant. The heaters were sufficient. 

I ordered the scallops and risotto with squid ink. Too salty for my taste but the scallops were done just right. My partner had the American Kolby beef which was pretty tender and the side of mashies was huge enough for both of us to share! The large prawns we ordered as an appetizer were massive and tasty! The liquid nitrogen from the bottom of the prawns made for a great presentation. Although I felt the food was a bit overpriced (minimum around $200 you'll probably spend) and the quality was good but not magnificent, the atmosphere and the staff were impeccable. The historic design indoors was gorgeous and the staff went above and beyond ensuring we were warm. They brought out blankets for us and checked up on us frequently. They treated us with as much care and attention as more reputable customers who walked through the door. 

They also gave us a gift - a Casa Loma cork stopper for our anniversary and a hand-written card which was lovely.  All in all, I would recommend for a fancy outing or celebration with a loved one!  Thanks, staff!",3
"Really enjoy everything about the restaurant, our server Dinaldo was amazing and very attentive! Food was great.",4
Not as good as last time because the steaks are burn out. Luckily the chef came to make an apology and give us a new one.,3
"Upon arrival we were seated at a dirty table outside away from heaters. Once asked if we could be moved or if the heater could be moved we were told on several occasions that they would check to see if it was possible. Ultimately we asked if we could move the table closer to the heaters that still nothing. Eventually we ordered drinks and a cheese platter and the drinks were delivered wrong and after an hour of sitting there no one had checked on us or taken the rest of our orders. We even told our server that we were ready and yet nothing happened and he walked by us at least 5 times without stopping to take the order. Eventually we had to stop a manager or a hostess to help us. Once that happened the same manager finally moved us in a better area but it really wasn‚Äôt any warmer for my companion. Isaac was our second server and he was very very nice and informative. As far as the food is concerned, if you are planning on charging someone $80 for a steak I‚Äôd hope it is an incredible piece of meat when in fact it was a very very average dinner at best for the prices that this place charges. The best part of the meal was the coconut cake along with the outdoor area for pictures.",0
"We were arranged a table facing the kitchen which the kitchen doors are open for waiters to go in and out.  Hence instead of immerse in a castle dinning experience, we were to watch the busy kitchen food delivery scene and could smell the bbq smoke from it throughout dinner.  Steak quality was good, but the doneness of the same medium prime steak varies in different orders we have made.  My one was obviously overdone and another guest's one was like medium rare. The caramelized sugar on our creme brulee happened to be burnt too dark and turned bitter.  Services were ok and waiter was friendly and attentive.  Cooking quality really depends on luck and it's not as top rated as the prices suggested.",3
"Stuart was a lovely waiter. He was extremely attentive and always around to ensure we had a lovely experience.  

The sommelier was a nice touch to open our bottle of wine but he took a little too long. We had our food come to us before the wine, which was disappointing. 

We did add a lobster tail to accompany our steak. Considering the lobster tail was more than the price of the steak, the tail was dry and rubbery. If we knew, we wouldn‚Äôt have ordered the lobster and went with a more expensive steak. 

For dessert our coconut cream pie and espresso martinis were delicious. 

Would I come back? Probably not.",2
"Loved the service and ambiance but didn‚Äôt love the food. Appetizers:Tuna tartare and Alaskan crab fritters, both excellent. For main we tried the Wagyu filet tasting platter (Japanese, Australian and American). In hindsight I think  individual servings may have been the way rot go.   Didn‚Äôt think it was worth $250. Ambiance was very nice and enjoyed the Halloween light display on the castle after dinner. If we were to come back, I would try the Italian restaurant next door.",2
"Nice place good food, but the service wasn‚Äôt good at all and the heat lamp stopped working halfway through",2
"Dejan was an incredible waiter, he was so patient and always there to make sure we were taken care of but never felt intrusive which is a very fine line to walk!  The salmon was surprisingly made very well and delicious with a perfect crispy skin over cooked kale. The tasting menu was a little pricy but very delicious and filling. He also made my fiancee feel very special with the happy birthday fruit and candle and the little bluebloods gift, what a sweet touch!",4
Bone in rib eye or the lobster Mac n cheese was so good,4
Caesar salad had way too much garlic but the Wagyu was phenomenal. Our server was also amazing and very attentive,4
"There were a lot of bugs flying around us and our food in the tent. A ton of mosquitoes and I was being eaten alive. Hardly could enjoy the meal just scratching from a ton of mosquitoe bites. 

I would not recommend any outside dining but the service and food was good.",2
"We had only dessert and drinks, but it was an amazing experience. Our server was patient and knowledgeable. Great way to end the Thanksgiving holiday :)",4
Close off the kitchen so we don‚Äôt keep hearing the bell ring every time there is an order ready,4
Donaldo was wonderful! Must visit spot for anyone that enjoys fine dining.,4
"Blueblood is a beautifully decor fine dining located in Casa Loma.¬† I always would love to take some good pictures before and after dinner.¬† Parking is relatively easy.¬† They had valet service before pandemic, not sure about now, so I just pay for standard guest parking.¬† We started with Lobster Bisque and grilled tiger prawns for appetizer.¬† Lobster Bisque totally worth the price because of the lobster chunks.¬† The soup is enough for two people to share. The grilled tiger prawns are jumbo size, they are fresh, but as a main course, 5 prawns are a bit less for normal people, we make a good decision to treat it as appetizer.¬† For the main, we had the seared jumbo scallop with niro risotto and American Barrel cut filet 8oz.¬† The scallop risotto is definitely the best in town.¬† The scallop is so large in size and so fresh.¬† All the seafood we had tonight are delicious and definitely has a WOW factor.¬† For the steak, it is by far one of the best filet I had.¬† We finished up with the raspberry cheesecake.¬† At $22 price point, the cheesecake is well enough for 4 people.¬† We were shocked about the size of the dessert.¬† Finally, I believe Blueblood has taken another step up on the food quality.¬† It is better than before pandemic.¬† I would definitely come back for Xmas dinner!",3
Really classy place! My boyfriend and I enjoyed our 2 year anniversary dinner here!,4
"While the food and service where okay (I feel The Keg is on par or better), it's nothing exceptional, and certainly does not warrant the pricing in my opinion. A status experience, in my opinion. I should mention that we dined indoors, and perhaps the outdoor setting is nicer - but would still be the same food, service and prices.",2
"Great food, the waiters were amazing. Definitely go back",4
Beautiful building and decor. It was much louder than we thought it would be with large parties of people. The waiter was nice but he was busy. My husband was very happy with his steak and sides. My scallops were very rare. Overall happy that we experienced it but won‚Äôt be going back.,3
Friends bday,4
Amazing service and food was good.  Would def recommend.,4
Amazing experience as usual! Very special place üåü,4
"Excellent service, view and food was amazing.
Food was amazing, but Scallop Risotto was delicious.",4
A nice place to celebrate.  The service was excellent.  And the ambiance was spectacular.,4
"Incredible food at a big premium. Our server, Stewart, was friendly and professional. Food came in a timely manner, except for cappuccinos that were removed from the bill. Overall excellent experience and a lovely night. Will definitely come again.",4
"Every was just perfect. Ambiance, food, service, decor, etc. Definitely coming back.",4
Delicious food! Paloma cocktail was delicious! Great service!,4
What an amazing night! Donaldo was our server and he was exceptional! He made some great menu suggestions and they were all delicious. We will definitely be back!,4
"Beautiful restaurant, great experience and friendly service! Went last night and already persuaded a friend this morning to book a reservation for tomorrow night!",4
"Birthday dinner 
Server Donaldo was amazing as well
As the food.",4
"Way over priced for the quality. Steak was good but I‚Äôve had better. Caesar salad good. Seafood old and dry. Sides were too oily. Service was horrible for this level of restaurant. Painfully slow, not very attentive and then waiter spilled a glass of red wine on the table. Didn‚Äôt comp it or the side of asparagus that got drenched. I had to ask it to be comped. Not cool. Sister‚Äôs blouse got splashed with the wine. Manager was nice and tried to make up for it by giving us a $100 gift cert but overall left a bad taste in our mouth. Won‚Äôt be back",0
Value for money no. Ambiance is good. Nice setting for out of towners.,1
"An amazing experience!! Beautiful place, imprecable service and amazing food!",4
"Everything was excellent except the Alaska crab fritters.
Very dry with too much breading and little crab",3
"This place is beautiful. From the scenery to the presentation of the food. Service was amazing, everyone there is extremely nice and respectful. Overall great experience. 5/5.",4
"Wait staff very good‚Ä¶.
You need someone at the entrance and parking‚Ä¶.
You should have a better answering service.
Our children wanted to order champagne and nobody returned their call‚Ä¶.",3
BEst Steakhouse ever,4
The person who first took our order kind of forgot about us and it seemed everyone around was being catered to while we were looking around for someone to take our order after the appetizers/remove dirty dishes‚Ä¶my boyfriend had to wave or say something to someone else for help and from then on we were well taken care of by that person. The service after the first hour was excellent otherwise. I would definitely return but I can‚Äôt stress this enough I only left a tip because of the other people who took care of us instead of the first guy who forgot about us. The guy who made the crepes table side was also really great. Will be returning thanks for the experience,4
"Service was slow, the waiter barely check our table to see if we wanted anything, clear cups and plates or fill our water. The steak should have been exceptional but was burnt/ over cooked. It is a beautiful restaurant but the service and food isn‚Äôt good enough to be worth the price tag.",2
"We loved Blueblood for our 1st wedding anniversary! Everything was amazing, and our server was great (he was from Ecuador) we can't remember his name. More than likely the best steaks we've ever had! Great job Casaloma, you outdid yourselves with this steakhouse!",4
"We were placed in the library and not the main diner. Was a bit disappointed about this as the table size was very small for 4 people. I wished the booking would have explained this as I chose the venue for the ambiance. I enjoyed the walk through the patio. Luca, our server was attentive, explained menu well, and made our dinner experience very enjoyable",3
"We loved our experience at BlueBlood. Donaldo, our server, was so attentive & amazing, and the rest of the staff that took care of us were great.
The food was delicious, although a bit too expensive. Regardless, my group had the best evening dinner.",4
Had a great experience staff were very welcoming and food was great,4
I had my anniversary dinner here and it is by far my favourite place to dine. Every time I go the service and food never disappoint. I have and will continue to recommend this experience to my friends and family.,4
"This was our second time at the beautiful magical Casa Loma. We reserved to dine at the Blueblooded restaurant. I was so impressed with the service. The atmosphere was comfortable and exceptional. The servers were content with a proper attitude, full-dressed uniforms, clean appearance, and well mannered. This restaurant is not the typcial fmaily type restaruant. It's classy! We loved the experience. The servers served our food and they did not reach over my food or glass not once. This is something I look for, and if it does happen I end up not eating my food and walking out. It was a special occasion our anniversary. They did not rush us at all, or make us feel we had to leave in a certain amount of time. The experience was elegant, unique, and the food and champagne were exquisite. This was our first time experiencing a 5 star classy restaurant and it was so worth it. It was not cheap but the experience and memory will stay with us forever. I had tears in my eyes looking out the window of the beautiful view while I sipped on the champagne. We have decided to make it a tradition to go back on our anniversary each year. Thank you so much for the dining experiencing and see you next year!",4
"We enjoy the ambience and views on the large outdoor seating area.  They also cater to our vegan lifestyle and are not made to feel unwelcome for it!  Beautiful evening, Thank you!",4
"Ombience and decor was executional, service was outstanding, the meal was very good but not great.... Very expensive (possibly over priced)",3
Anniversary,4
Everything was amazing,4
"Best steak I've ever had, service was friendly and prompt",4
Our servers were outstanding. The food and the ambiance were exceptional. Would highly recommend and come back.,4
"The service, ambiance, courtesy, food and cocktails were excellent! Everything was delicious and lovely, which made for a very memorable evening with great friends.",4
"Fantastic, amazing service and quality!",4
"Has dinner with girlfriends.  Beautiful atmosphere, excellent service. Quality of food fantastic and very large portions.  Never disappoints!",4
"Food is mediocre. For a Lobster and stake and tips cost me 300 bucks not even worth for the price. 
Service was good but no effort too much.",2
"First time at Blueblood and wanted to have a nice treat for my girlfriend. Food and service was great and they made her feel special which is all I could ask for. The staff who served us (Stephen, Issac, Jacque) we‚Äôre super friendly and made us feel welcome.",3
Insane view amazing service and fair pricing. Had a better experience here than harbour 60. You can‚Äôt beat the castle and the skyline view. Came for a birthday and was gifted a wine cork and a little card. The servers were so caring and the food was great. After spending more than double at harbour 60 I can say this experience was far superior and am looking forward to going again,4
very good! the food is great and the ambient is perfect for any occasion.,4
"Let's start with the good. Dinning at a castle üè∞ is amazing! That ambiance is really what your paying for. 
The service is honestly one of the best we have had in Toronto. I think this is solely on the server and  hosts we had.
Now the food. 
The apps were ok. 
We had crab fritters and soup.  
Steak was slightly over cooked and tasted ok at best. (NOT STEAK HOUSE WORTHY)
The sides were actually my favorite part! The crembrule was a perfect way to end the night.

Drinks:
i had the once upon a time (a take on a old fasion).
I would go back just for that.

$15 for parking. (Thats some bs)",2
You all are amazing! Thank you for an amazing experience!,4
"Amazing food, superior service, one of the best fine dining experience in Toronto.",4
Birthday dinner was fantastic,4
"Beautiful ambience, top class service. Everything was elegant and well put together.",3
"Our second time here, it‚Äôs ok.  My husband‚Äôs $110. Steak was burnt, the table bread we didn‚Äôt like & for a table of 5 we didn‚Äôt have enough of the salts for our steaks, they forgot the spoons for the oyster‚Äôs sauce. For such a prestigious place I would have expected a little bit more.  We didn‚Äôt like how the senior staff,  were treating the junior staff, in front of customers.  Not sure we will return.",2
Incredible food and service. Generous portions and great wine,4
Great good and service! Would go back and try the T-bone.,4
Very beautiful location. Felt very safe and the service was excellent.,4
"To my opinion a little over priced!!!
everything else excellent.",2
Trevor - the,4
It was my birthday and we had a request to give us a booth and had to seat in the gym looking section of restaurant which was for emergencies. our steak came totally black on outside and we ordered medium rare !!,1
Best steak I have ever had in my life! Waiter was so nice and wasn‚Äôt lingering around and gave us our space to eat rather than being bothered every second which is what i liked. Overall is wasn‚Äôt amazing service and the food was just as amazing,4
Worth the hype! Food was beyond delicious. Service was amazing and a beautiful ambience as well. Made for an incredible anniversary dinner. Will definitely be back!,4
"Outstanding food and service but the washrooms are not kept clean throughout the evening.
Floors are unreasonably slippery",3
The Ribeye steak was amazing.  Service was great.,4
"Service was absolutely great, and the ambiance/decor is top notch. Unfortunately, the food wasn't the best. We had the short rib wellington (the short rib was dry), crab fritters (exterior wasn't crunchy, and was a bit doughy), as well as the oysters (the mignonettes were very good).",3
The food was good. Steak was a bit salty. Service was slow. However the place is absolutely breathtaking.,3
My Wife & I had an absolutely fantastic time at Blue Blood. The service was wonderful and the food exceptional.,4
"This place was nothing but exquisite. If you like good food and you don‚Äôt mind spending a bit more than usual, then this is the place for you. Service was also great and they actually look at the reasoning for the dinner and in my case it was my gf‚Äôs birthday. They brought out a little souvenir and birthday card extending their well wishes which was a first in the many restaurants I‚Äôve been to. I would definitely come again and give it another try!",4
"Fantastic atmosphere and unbeatable view. The food was subpar (minus the baked Alaska ‚Ä¶ that was incredible) and disappointing for the price, but if you want a cool experience this is a great choice!",2
"I was expecting the food to be excellent given the price we are paying for it. Didn‚Äôt found anything ‚Äúwow‚Äù about the steak and it was quite dry.  despite asking it be medium rare it was more on a well done side. I liked the service, the place but the food was a very disappointing factor.",3
"This was my first time eating on the patio at Blueblood. It was a beautiful setting and they accommodated my uncles 82nd birthday with an amazing table overlooking the garden, where a beautiful wedding was taking place. The service was outstanding as it has always been. I highly recommend BlueBlood for your special occasions. Yes, it is pricy if you want to splurge and go all out, but, for a really good high end steakhouse, you can have a reasonable dinner for two for cost of a concert.",4
My wife and I went  to celebrate our 10 year anniversary dressing our best..  Service and food was excellent BUT we wouldn‚Äôt consider this restaurant UPSCALE enough to celebrate anything when they allowed other customers in short and sandals. Runners and tank-top to dine in. When spending $653 on a 3 course meal for 2..,2
Best restaurant ever! Amazing food and amazing ambiannce! Recommend 100%,4
"I was so excited to dine at Blue Bloods and expected an upscale experience. My husband got the wrong steak and the waiter couldn‚Äôt tell the difference between a Waygu A5 steak ( he ordered waygu) and an American rib eye. We complained about the steak, the cold potatoes and the veggies on my plate that weren‚Äôt cooked and shared that we expected a dining experience like you‚Äôd get at the cities top restos. The waiter said that it certainly wasn‚Äôt fine dining at Blue Bloods and he wasn‚Äôt sure where we got that impression. Hmmmm maybe the prices?",0
"Wonderful ambience. A little expensive, so it is only good to visit for very special occasions.",2
"The tuna entree was delicious, the most delicious I‚Äôve ever had.  The French fries were amazing and the oysters as well.  Everything was very tasty. Well done!",3
Only criticism is that we were seated at a table for two in the hallway which did put a damper on this experience. Food was delicious and service was great.  Will go back but will definitely request seating elsewhere.,3
Mediocre food. Way over priced,1
Annivesarry,4
"Slow service, mediocre steak, great location. For this level of restaurant, no where near meeting expectations. Excellent Caesar salad but steak dry and overcooked. Waited for drinks each time, humid night, no coasters/napkins until requested.  Waiter seemed to disappear for extended periods. Sort of what you would expect for a $100 meal not $500 meal. (2 persons) I would not return.",1
"Fantastic steakhouse.   Maybe best we have ever been to, server was fantastic and the view from outside incredible.   Bring your money, can‚Äôt justify spending that much in my head but glad I did.",4
"Blue Blood made our dining experience extremely memorable! The service was unbelievable and the we had the Wagu filet it was amazing, probably the best I‚Äôve ever had!",4
Amazing as always ‚ù§Ô∏è,4
Outstanding steak house and dining experience.  Great setting for a dinner with valued business clients.  I will definitely be back!,4
Donalda was our server and was,4
"Having not seen my mom since before the pandemic, I decided to surprise her with dinner at Blueblood on the one night I had to spend with her in Toronto. We were really looking forward to this. Sadly, her lobster bisque was tepid. We don‚Äôt feel comfortable sending food back but cold soup just isn‚Äôt palatable. The soup was promptly replaced but it was also cold even tho it was served in a piping hot bowl. The lobster was extremely tough, chewy and over-cooked. Here‚Äôs the thing: It is extremely uncomfortable to send food back twice in a row so she ate some and our server took it away. My caprese salad was delicious btw probably the best fresh mozzarella I‚Äôve ever had. We ordered a local rib steak with mash and mushrooms which all arrived cold. The only hot item was the tasty morel sauce. We were quite hungry at that point so we did eat most of the steak and some of the sides. Once my mom went to the washroom, I did bring up the temperature issue to our server as not to embarrass her and he was very apologetic. I understand it‚Äôs taboo to complain after you‚Äôve eaten but again, it‚Äôs not easy for some people to be fussy given the current climate. The manager took care of the soup and they gave us complimentary creme br√ªl√©e but I really don‚Äôt see the value in our experience tonight. Maybe it was an off-night but I have no issue paying $$$ for prime steak in a beautiful steak house but we couldn‚Äôt help but leave feeling so disappointed and that I paid over $300 for a meal that was below standards. On a good note, our server (Stuart/Stewart) was extremely professional and very kind. My non-al cocktail was tasty too!",2
"I booked this place for my wife‚Äôs birthday dinner and was pleasantly surprised! Everything was spot on from the hospitality by our servers, the gifts that they gave her, baked alaska dessert to the steak ofcourse!",4
"The steak was the best we ever had! We skipped the appetizers and chose cocktails instead. They were amazing! For mains we had the Canadian filet and rib eye - they were cooked perfectly and the cognac peppercorn sauce complimented them well. The duck fat fries and broccolini were delicious too. We finished off sharing a slice of the cheesecake, which was to die for. Overall, we had a fantastic time, the staff were amazing and so tentative. We would definitely come back!",4
"Excellent service , food and ambience , I highly recommend BlueBlood steakhouse.",4
Service and attention to detail was outstanding. Gorgeous rooms and surroundings. Steaks are the best in the city!,4
It‚Äôs was awesome like always. I love blueblood,4
"Was wonderful, best food and a wonderful atmosphere",4
"It was an amazing experience from start to finish. Great food, great beverages, great service!",4
"Blueblood is truly one of my favourite restaurants in the Gta. Great drinks, food and service every time!",4
"Everything here is perfect, from the food, to the service and setting. Definitely coming back in 2 weeks.",4
"Food was not tasy,  everything salty. Steak and Crab fritters were very salty",0
Service was amazing.  The food was amazing. The atmosphere is absolutely  stunning. I would recommend eating here any given day,4
"I love this restaurant this was my 3rd time going and I can‚Äôt get enough . The food is amazing, the atmosphere is perfect and not mention the service . Thanks to Connor our server he was excellent .",4
"First of all, the service was impeccable. The server was very knowledgeable, made great recommendations and was very polite. The food was DELICIOUS! Everything was presented with class and with care. The room at Blueblood was gorgeous. Well it is Casaloma, so it‚Äôs going to be beautiful. Highly recommended!",4
"Outstanding venue, food and service.  Will be back 100%",4
"We went to celebrate out anniversary and I wanted to make sure it was special. The ambience and decor is everything I expected. The experience was wonderful and the service provided second to none. Donaldo was the gentleman who was taking care of us and he provided honest feedback about our orders; he even helped us choose something that he figured we would enjoy. 

We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the restaurant. I highly recommend them for a night out or any other special occasions.",4
Amazing experience. Service and food exceeded expectations. Fantastic place for a celebration!!!!,4
Food was not tasty at all. For the money you spend the food should be much better.,0
"The service was lacking, and our food was just ok. For the price, I expected more. I'll save my money and go to shore club or barbarians next time.",2
"Disappointing meal. Never had such a chewy steak. And knives are so dull I have my arm hurting from trying to cut through my meal. The service was horrendous. We had to keep on flagging down our server for drinks and basic follow up requests. To top it off, we asked for food to go which was forgotten. All in all, quite the disappointment and embarrassment infront of our guests. And I used to be quite the fan‚Ä¶ I will reconsider going here again‚Ä¶",1
"DO NOT eat here. I had never been to Casa Loma so I was very excited to dine at their restaurant. 
1. When we were brought to our patio table, we were seated at plastic tiny tables that had NO leg room. I‚Äôm only 5.5‚Äù‚Ä¶..
2. It took about 10 minutes for water to arrive at our table, and another 10 minutes for our server to come and take our order. Our drinks were served maybe 10 minutes later, at which point our waiter asked if we wanted bread, so my husband who was starving at this point said yes. They brought us the most disgusting cheese ‚Äúbuns‚Äù. We couldn‚Äôt eat them. And I love cheese.  Thank god 2 minutes later our starters arrived. I could recommend the starters - we had the rib ravioli and the octopus (which apart from looking like a horse‚Äôs d**k, tasted decent). 
3. I ordered the miso crusted Chilean sea bass. What I got was a piece of fish, about 6 inches high, with not a morsel of miso anywhere. It smelt fishy and tasted fishy. It was $69!!!!! My husband ordered a steak which he liked. $100. Lol. We also ordered some sides and thank god we did because we were starving. 
4. Throughout the meal our server came only ONCE to our table to ask if everything was ok, and we reluctantly said ‚Äúyes‚Äù, because he had fear in his eyes‚Ä¶. Which Perhaps was due to the cut he had on his hand, the same hand he was using to serve us, which was bleeding through the band aid. 

The bill came to $450 not including tip. The credit card machine prompts you to press a 20% tip button, and there is no way to bypass it or out in any other amount. 

At least, I thought, we can walk through the main level of the castle on our way out and maybe then the experience would be positive. Unfortunately, the main level was sparse, they have removed everything from the main hallway, except for maybe three paintings, and we had to jump out of the way every 5 seconds so as to not collide with a server. Where those servers were hiding while we were eating, I have no idea. 
DO NOT GO THERE.",0
"Amazing food, service, views and ambiance! What more could you ask for?",4
"Food was amazing, the service at the beginning wasn‚Äôt the best. We were at our table by our self‚Äôs for more than 15 min with no even offered a glass of water. It took around 15-20 min to have the waiter to come to the table. He (David) was the best with his recommendations and service! At the end the experience was amazing, the food also!!",3
Enjoyed the outdoor patio with downtown view of skyscrapers,3
"We had an amazing experience, with excellent food and the best service from a wonderful waiter. 
A tour of the wine cellar completed our night.",4
Connor was the most amazing server--so attentive and kind. Wonderful evening with great food. You know you're there for the experience so it will ofc break your wallet in a bit. Lovely dinner!,4
It was great,4
It was the best birthday I‚Äôve ever had. Magical!,4
10/10 steak cooked to perfection. Outstanding service as well. Our waiter Alex gave my partner a free Casa Loma wine stopper because it was his birthday. We didn't order dessert because we were so full but our waiter went out of his way to put a candle on some fruits and chocolate. We will definitely be returning again :),4
It is a great experience especially for out of town guests. It would be nice to be able to see the house considering the bill $250 pp,4
I really enjoyed my self my girl friend told me she had a wonderful dinner I was happy everything I ordered was amazing and my waitress was amazing I would be looking to come back any time!!,4
"Fabulous on all levels! Everything was amazing ~ food, service, ambiance!",4
Amazing food amazing service definitely will go back,4
Incredible.,4
Had a great experience dining in such an amazing place!,4
"VERY nice, ambience, good food, romantic place.thank you üòã",3
"outstanding food and incredible service, thanks dax!!",4
"The experience was outstanding in every respect- beautiful surroundings, great view of the city, excellent food and service.",4
"Our waiter James was amazing and very informative. 
The servings were quite generous and food was excellent. 
I would definitely return.",4
Had a wonderful first experience at Blueblood! Loved the ambiance and service. The food was delicious and special thanks to Isaac for the too knotch service and friendly vibe he offered. Isaac definitely made a huge difference in our dinning experience and was charismatic and super attentive. Thank you for helping me make my wife‚Äôs birthday special! Thank you Blueblood restaurant as well for the lovely card and gift as part of my wife‚Äôs gift!,4
A lot of items on the menus have been taken out. They need more than just steaks and turfs. I wish they had more comprehensive meals,4
Incredible experience and great food! The service could have been a lot better.,4
"Service is good, a little bit pricey, the steak is not too good. Not worth it",0
"Amazing food, presentation and service.",4
great location.. food quality was great.  outdoor patio was nice,4
Horrible food . Horrible experience. I repeat horrible food,0
Pricey but was a good experience. Valet  parking average price. All main dishes have no sides included.,4
"It was a great night, the food was delicious and our server (Donaldo) is AMAZING! We truly enjoyed our time at BlurBlood and we will definitely go back there again. Thank you!",4
"Terrific dinning experience, the service was nothing short of spectacular and the food was delicious. The sommelier was excellent, and recommend a wine and ended up upgrading our wine due to not having the one recommended in stock, to something that was impeccable and unique, heightening our overall dinning experience.",4
"It was alright, but expensive for what you got‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.",2
Lovely! Great service and good food!,4
Celebrated my hubby's bday. Our server Lucas was very attentive. Our Lobster Bisque was cold and Lucas relayed it to the Chef and he came back and replaced our bisque right away and ensured every dish came at the right temperature. We enjoyed our dinner and good experience.,2
"Took my husband here for his birthday and he is still in awe. It was both of us first time at this restaurant and it was worth every penny. If you‚Äôre looking for a special place for a special occasion, this is the place. From the ambiance to the food to the customer service, it was A-1. We ordered the table side Caesar salad, rack of lamb, salmon, and the scallop dish along with 4 sides. The sides are big enough to share for either 2 or 3 people, so you only need to order 1 of each. The salmon was the biggest piece of salmon I‚Äôve ever ordered and seen from any restaurant. The rack of lamb was tender, juicy and perfectly seasoned, the scallops were just right and the lobster mac and cheese plus the other sides were great. I read reviews before I went to this restaurant, some were good and some bad, but please try this restaurant before you knock it, I can‚Äôt see how going to this restaurant would give you a negative vibe and when you walk in you feel like a king and queen of the castle. Don‚Äôt judge before you try it. I‚Äôm giving this restaurant thumbs up big time and will be going back ‚Äî soon.",4
"Went for our 30th Anniversary,  no recognition.   Ambiance was nice and service was good.  Brocollini wasn't cooked well at all, hard to eat and had it taken off our bill.  Husband was incredibly ill in the evening, we believe it was from the octopus appetizer.  Crepes were over cooked and not worth $30.",2
"Ambiance isn‚Äôt there.  With covid there are plastic partitions between tables.  Barely hear any music.  So dull and boring.  Food mediocre at best.  I‚Äôve dined there twice before the pandemic and food was exceptional as was the service.  

Octopus was hard, crab cakes a ball of undercooked dough, lamb ok, Caesar lacking flavour.  Now, unfortunately I wouldn‚Äôt go back.  Best part is walking around the outside of the castle.",2
The service here is impeccable! Highly recommended for date night.,4
"We have heard so many amazing things about Blueblood but we had the worst experience due to our server. We got married at Casa Loma last year and thought we would get the same or similar service‚Ä¶ it was the opposite, our server was rude, cut us off when we were talking, rushed us to make decisions on the menu and then has the audacity to talk about his tip‚Ä¶ horrible horrible service.",0
"1. The outdoor dining was not very comfortable. Although the view was fantastic.. there were bugs, wasps all over the place making it hard to enjoy the ambience and food.
2. The food was extremely expensive hence poor value for money.... We ordered the bone-in rib eye for over $120 but the portion was extremely small to share.. yet we still had to pay for side dishes and vegetables.. poor pricing.. 
3. Our server was quite horrible..after taking our order, he never returned not even to deliver the food.. it was brought on by another server..everytime we needed something extra, we had to call on multiple different waiters.. poor service
4. The baguette provided while we were waiting for our order was stale,  cold and horrible.. we were even willing to pay for something else but were told that‚Äôs all we get.. 
overall we came to celebrate a birthday and I was very disappointed to say the least.. I definitely will not be returning here or recommending it..",0
"Me and my girlfriend went to BlueBlood for the 1st time for her 30th birthday. From the moment we got there we were immediately greeted and brought to our table. Service was amazing, Costa was our server with Issac helping out and they were nothing short of excellent. We started with Wagyu beef carpaccio and the table side Caesar salad both were amazing. For mains we got the Wagyu A5 filet & the Australian MB9+ filet, both steaks melted in our mouths and we didn‚Äôt want it to end. We ended our meal with the vanilla bean creme br√ªl√©e, it was very tasty. Overall experience was amazing, would highly recommend for any type of date night or special occasion. Will be back sooner rather then later.",4
"Love Blueblood. Always a great experience! The food, service snd ambiance is top notch! Spectacular evening!! So special!",4
Amazing birthday as always. Looking forward to the menu expanding to have a plant based menu! So that vegans can enjoy dinner with their meat eating friends! Awesome service as always,4
"Food was great. 
Server gave little to no attention to us. He was more focused on the table behind us, and seemed like it was an ex colleague. As every staff was greeting them. Not even once was water refilled for us. 

Expected better service for a premium restaurant",3
"Gorgeous View of the City. Prefect place to relax and talk with someone you love. Service is great, view is unlike any other, food is good...not great, but good enough with the view.",4
Staff was very attentive & made my birthday celebration amazing! I will be back,4
"One of the best steakhouses in Toronto.
Patio was great, the view overlooking the city.
The food was amazing all cooked to perfection.",4
"I came here last year to celebrate my mom‚Äôs birthday, and the service and food was absolutely amazing, but last night, I was honestly very disappointed by the entire dining experience. It was a very important birthday I was celebrating with my best friend, and it was a total let down. 

We were walked to a table that did not look wiped and had one chair. We sat there for a good 8 minutes before our server came to offer water. The sommelier was quite unwelcoming and unpleasant, and acted as if opening our bottle of wine was a bother, followed by rolling her eyes when she left our table.

The server barely explained anything, (the different salts that are presented with the steak) which I wouldn‚Äôt have known if had I not come here before. 

I greatly appreciated the happy birthday plate that was presented to my friend at the end of our dinner, but that was probably the only highlight of the evening. I was going to bring my mom back for her birthday coming up, but I‚Äôm not sure I will be dining here anytime soon.",1
Date night,4
Stewart is great! Didn‚Äôt like where they sat us though. I had asked for a different section.,4
"Pros - Cocktails were very yummy!

Cons - Food was nothing special at all... Everything we got was very average or below average. Absolutely ridiculous what you get for the price it is. Not much taste, especially the octopus dish (they take off the skin so it just looks like you're eating something that looks VERY unappetizing) 

- pour view of anything (skyline, castle, fountain)

- Best part in the whole experience was honestly the bread. 

Sad to say I had very high hopes for Blue Bloods because of its reputation but we we're left feeling very unsatisfied for such a special night for us.
We wont be coming here again and warning friends they should only go if someone else is paying... NOT WORTH IT.",2
Worst service I‚Äôve ever had. Arrived on time for my reservation and wasn‚Äôt seen for half an hour. Water arrived 45 mins after being seated. Repeatedly asked to speak with the manager to get our orders in and they never came. Food and drinks were good however had to wait over an hour before getting the first dish.,1
"Great atmosphere , fabulous experience.  Our server Gio went above and beyond to make our dinner wonderful!",4
Amazing. Celebrated my parents 30th anniversary,4
"Thinking back, I unfortunately cannot recall his name, but our server was great! He was very attentive and easy-going.

I did not really like my first drink after all and he went out of his way to correct it by recommending me another drink. The second one was delicious!

BlueBlood Steakhouse had been a first for my boyfriend and I (took him for his birthday). Our food was heavenly and the portions were excellent. Compliments to the chef who prepared our food!

10/10 Would recommend and will return in the future!",4
"The service was terrible the waitress forgot our salads and drinks, the cheese buns weren‚Äôt good, the oysters were bad and caprese salad was very basic with no flavour ! The seafood tower was very bland and underwhelming! 2 people $430 Bill totally not worth it!",1
Our server made this a wonderful experience! My third time coming here and I hope to have him serve us every time!,4
You must try BlueBlood Steakhouse! Melt in your mouth steaks from ONTARIO!!,4
Went to BlueBlood to celebrate a friends 60th birthday.  Our outdoor table was exceptional and the ambiance second to none.  The menu was like reading a book of all your favorite things and difficult to make a choice.  I decided on the Foie Gras and it was stunning!  Tuna Tartare and Lobster Bisque was chosen by the other members of our party.  We had the rack of lamb and the Chilean Sea Bass as our entre.  Everyone of us was loved our meal.  Cooked to perfection and served to impress the eyes.  Dessert was a recommendation from our waiter with the Apple Pie and we also had the Bananas Foster made to order at our table.  Incredible evening with 5 star in all categories.   Would highly recommend if you want to feel like you have been airlifted to Europe and are indulging at a mystical castle!,4
First table offered was NOT 2 meters apart. Barely 1 foot and the other table was raised over our table. Asked to be moved. Ordered 3 appetizers and only 2 arrived together because 3rd was wrong and I had to wait several minutes for it. Drinks took a long time to arrive also. I won't be back!!!!,2
Only complaint was we asked for a table facing the CN tower to celebrate our anniversary but we were seated at a corner table at the end of the restaurant with a side / minimal view - was disappointed as we specified this in our open table booking.,3
Very nice place to celebrate special events. Ambiance is lovely.,4
"Lots of nice touches like the birthday card we received. Friendly service, good cocktails. Wasn‚Äôt keen on the noir risotto I had but everything else was good. Was a bit awkward to notice masks seemed to be optional in the kitchen from where we sat.",3
"Bluebloods is one of the finest dining establishments in Toronto. The ambiance of Casa Loma cannot be matched, the service is prompt and friendly, and the food is amazing. It's not for everyday dining, but for a special occasion or to impress a date, this is the best choice.",4
"A nice experience.  Food was good but very expensive.  If you want a special night out, this is the place.  It would not be my ‚Äúgo to‚Äù place.",2
One of the best meals we‚Äôve ever had - great food and service.,4
"Beautiful patio dining views, and ambiance. Food was delicious, and the service was excellent. Would definitely recommend.",4
Booked this place for my parents. My dads a picky eater and he loveeed the steak my mom had the salmon and hated it. I said who goes to a steak house for fish. I‚Äôve always had great experiences here and love their steaks,4
Great experience!! Great view!! Great service!!! Definitely worth it.,4
"The food was great, the service was good but the room was stiflingly hot and it ruined the whole meal.  Nobody wants to spend hundreds of dollars on a meal for two only to be horribly uncomfortable, and for the life of me, I can't understand how such a beautiful show piece where millions have been spent on attention to detail would leave temperature control out of the equation.  What was supposed to be a celebratory meal became a rush to get the hell out of there.  It was actually nicer outside, and outside was beyond swampy.",2
My birthday!,3
Overpriced for the quality of food. More expensive than Jacobs or Alo but not comparable quality.,2
"Sommelier Marie Claire and our server Lucas were absolutely phenomenal in terms of taking care of our party of 2 which grew into a party of 4 as the night went on. Great staff, great food, and great views sitting outdoors!",4
Anniversary,4
Food was very good. Server was very helpful. Beautiful setting.,3
"The best waiter ever !! Super sweet and caring !
Not too much but super available:) never disappointed",3
"Birthday 

Dinner was great, portions are huge.",4
"A really special evening and superb teamwork. We felt welcomed and celebrated (our 20th anni) from start to finish. Special shout-out to Geo, our server, who was gracious and good-humoured. What was especially nice was that other servers (e.g., Stewart/Stuart) assisting Geo understood how they were important too -- we appreciated that each person we had contact with knew, and mentioned, that it was our anniversary. The bubbles and the desserts were decadent and delicious. The young women hostess crew were also exceptional (you'd be surprised how many hostesses don't smile in this town -- with or without masks). The anniversary card was special and delightful. We floated home -- thank you. p.s. Your The valets were fun too.",4
"The Food was great.  However it was extremely hot inside.  It seems like the air conditioning wasn't working.  It made it extremely hard to enjoy our food as it was uncomfortable.  When spending $400, you'd think you would seat customers in the air conditioned section.",3
Truly phenomenal ambiance and atmosphere. Eye popping and picture worthy setting great food and outstanding service from valet to hostess to waiters. The salad at your table is a must and the premium you pay for eating there is worth it.,4
"For a steakhouse, the steak at Blueblood was amazing. It was well prepared and tender. However, the apps were a bit underwhelming. The grilled octopus was very under seasoned, and the chorizo was not that tasty in my opinion. I wished the waiter would've informed of us of the added steak sauces. He just casually mentioned there were steak sauces available but we didn't know they were $6. We ordered 2 of them thinking it was complimentary for each steak. The steak sauce weren't that great either. The steak tasted well on it's own or with the various selection of salts given. Overall, great ambiance and steak. Everything else was just ok.",2
"Ian provided excellent service.  Lovely evening in a beautiful
setting.",3
"Second time eating here and was  VERY disappointed this time. We ordered the US ribeye and it was terrible! Very chewy, a number of bites inedible and had to be discreetly spit out.  Service was extremely slow.  Cocktails took 30-45 minutes to arrive. It was 5:30 and only a handful of tables.  We had a bottle of Pinot. It was being stored at an incorrect temperature so had to be iced. They kept it on ice not next to our table but across the restaurant so we were unable to pour more when our glass became empty. i have never had that experience before Beautiful setting but when dropping $1000 bucks you really should have better quality food and impeccable service. You are 100% paying for the setting.",2
"Wouldn‚Äôt recommend. We were seated at a table near the building. Plastic chairs and plastic tables. Seating area covered by plastic tents which limited all air flow and last might was hot‚Ä¶no breeze due to the tent and no view. Server set the table after we were seated. Candles placed haphazardly on tables halfway through service. Water glass was chipped. I ordered sparking water and it was placed far away in a shared ice bucket with other tables‚Äô bottles. I couldn‚Äôt fill my own glass and the server came around to fill it, but not frequently enough. Table water provided was warm. Gougeres were delicious. Table side Caesar salad was decent. Crab cakes were gummy and tough. I ate one of three. My husbands strip loin was decent but not amazing. Sweet potato shoestring fries were inconsistently cooked, some under and many charred. Construction all over Casa Loma so we couldn‚Äôt walk around the gardens before or after dinner. Patrons were underdressed, wearing jeans and golf shirts for the most part‚Ä¶.I guess it fits with the plastic chairs, tables and tents setting.",1
"Always a fantastic experience, food is on point, servers knowledge was great! We will definitely be back!",4
"Amazing experience, they did such a fantastic job, everything was perfect highly recommend this place",4
Love this place every year we come!,4
A great place to dine in. Outdoor dinning with beautiful scenery and quality food as well as pleasant service is amazing,4
Very yummy food. Inside does not have much air conditioning. Had to switch to patio. Very expensive meal,4
This is truly an experience. The food and service was incredible. Casa Loma is one of the best sites in all of Toronto. There really is nothing negative I could say about this experience.,4
"Very disappointing  service, the food is ok. The place is beautiful, though.",2
"The steak and  burger were great but the caesar salad and the side of frites and potato gratin were ok .

Wine was great!",3
"It was so hot the air conditioner was not working we couldn‚Äôt enjoy our food to the point where we left half plate. 
Our server was disinterested. 

While making my reservations I had told it was a birthday dinner there was no effort.",1
Everything was wonderful except the fact that it was super hot dining indoor.  They had doors open so didn't feel the AC at all.  We were literally swearing. If I knew ahead I would have booked the patio instead.,2
"Great service, always accommodative. Portions were generous, but still a bit pricey.",3
"As a fine dining restaurant, I don‚Äôt know why there were food flys flying around the food and table. That was very disgusting. The lobster soup I don‚Äôt recommend, the lobster seemed not fresh",0
"All Good, The food is fresh and well presented, the parking is expensive!
I was expecting more for our 20th anniversary, like a free or discounted dessert.
Thank you.",3
"This place is all about atmosphere!  Beautiful and romantic,  definitely something to try!
The servers were great and accommodating giving it a great experince 
I was disappointed in the portion size and taste of the food for the price.  Not a place I would suggest for food unfortunately.  The potential to be better is there.",2
Worst experience ever and I've been here many times,0
Our waiter Gio was amazing and super sweet!! The food was so good and I would definitely be back again!,4
"Exceptional experience!
Everything was incredible server was amazing
Highly recommend",4
"We were looking forward for the fine dining experience to celebrate several occasions with my partner. We waited for our reservation for few weeks and were excited to finally get there through all the traffic during hot day. 
After being seated at our table I went to washroom and unfortunately got locked up as the lock was broken. My partner called for the help which was not helpful as they could not open the door. After 30 minutes spent in the washroom without AC during the hottest day they told me that I have to climb through the window and return to the restaurant through the construction area of the castle and kitchen. Imagine here I am in small black cocktail dress and high heels climbing through the window and getting back to the restaurant. 
It would have been fine if it was part of escape room experience but definitely not the fine dining:))  
Upon return to our table no one approached us to apologise for the incident. I called for the manager to let them know about what happened  on what his response was  ‚Äú well now you can enjoy your dinner‚Äù . 
Overall the service was not great, oysters were hard loosening which never happens in other restaurants. 
I was not ready to pay 18% for the service given the incident and instead we paid 10% on the total bill of approx. $600. 
What amazed me most is when waiter came back to our table placing the receipt next to me stating that we did not paid enough gratitude‚Ä¶ absolutely not acceptable for this type of the restaurant‚Ä¶ would hesitate to recommend it due to poor service and attitude to their guests",0
"The service was amazing. Our server Justina was the nicest lady. When I received the lobster bisque soup, I unfortunately didn‚Äôt like it. Justina walks up and asks me if I like it, and of course I didn‚Äôt want to be rude so I said it‚Äôs good. She was able to recognize that I wasn‚Äôt satisfied and insisted to take my plate away. The food is impeccable, the Japanese wagyu steak melts in your mouth. The wine collection is amazing. The ambience and environment gives you a classy vibe. Dining in this little castle was definitely worth it. Overall a great experience.",4
"It was hot, there was no air conditioning. Service was fine, with a minor hiccup with the wrong order.",2
Very hot in the restaurant. No ac.,0
Came for my sisters birthday and was unfortunately rather disappointed. Overrated food. The only thing that was good was the Japanese and Australian wagyu and I would hope so. The burgers were like biting into a dry flavourless meatball and one had bones in it. The mashed potatoes weren‚Äôt creamy and had chunks throughout and the prime rib eye was dry and flavourless. I thought our server was the buss boy because he never introduced himself and took about 15 min to greet us. No personality and overall a very dull experience that was collectively agreed upon by the 5 of us who dined. The best part of the evening was our strolls to the toilet to take a look at the old library and architecture in the castle.,1
Nice place with good service!,4
The restaurant is lovely and the service was excellent. We went for our anniversary and we will definitely visit again!,4
"Super fancy, great location, amazing dishes & wine list",4
Not only was the food exquisite but the staff and manager really did make our night (celebrating a birthday) a memorable one. Thank you!,4
"Everything was fantastic! the  food was outstanding, the service was great, ambiance awesome the only thing that actually threw off our whole evening was  the way they recognized our anniversary. when i made the reservation it was asked if coming for an occasion so I advised our anniversary because we could only get a 5pm reservation at the end of our meal we decided to go somewhere else for dessert since still early. The waiter asked if we wanted desert and we declined. he then brought over a single raspberry with a candle on it.  we did not want dessert it is more about the impression it left us after spending so much money on a lovely dinner your don't even send a slice of desert,  some chocolate truffles  or 2 glasses of prosecco really a raspberry I rather you did not send anything at all.  we were a family of 5 and even my younger adult children commented, sorry left a sour taste in my mouth!  when spending that much for dinner not a nice way to end our meal.",4
Everything was wonderful. Service & food was amazing. Will definitely be back.,4
I felt like more could have been done as it was my fiancee‚Äôs birthday and we were seated in possibly the worst area of the restaurant. We also spent over $450 and they didn‚Äôt give any dessert for his birthday!,0
Amazing experience. My husband and I went to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary. Our waiter was super kind. The workers were all nice and very welcoming. The food was great and I like that they had a separate menu for non-alcoholic drinks.,4
"A summer dinner, in the evening around sunset, is pretty fantastic. Their Caesar",4
"Good experience, but food was overpriced - speacially the steak options.",2
"The view is beautiful, but the meal is mediocre. For a luxury steak, I'd go somewhere else like Jacob's or Allen's (during steak fest every February). However, the ambience is hard to beat.",2
As if dining at Cash Loma wasn‚Äôt scenic enough there was a beautiful wedding taking place in the garden. The staff was amazing I will even go as far to say the best service I‚Äôve had at any restaurant. Food was delicious and portion size was more than enough. Price was very reasonable and cheaper than I expected. Overall great experience! I will definitely visit again and again.,4
"Nous avons r√©serv√© en soir√©e.Tr√®s belle place et tr√®s bon service! Notre serveur Vito √©tait tr√®s patient , sympathique et hospitalier. Malgr√© notre anglais un peu maladroit üòÖ, il nous a mise √† l'aise. Lors de notre prochaine visite √† Toronto, nous y retournerons assur√©ment.

We booked in the evening. Very nice place and very good service! Our server Vito was very patient, friendly and hospitable. Despite our somewhat awkward English üòÖ, he put us at ease. On our next visit to Toronto, we will definitely be back.",4
On a hot day the main room was a bit stuffy so we asked to be moved to the bar dinning area. The staff was very friendly and accommodated us with no issues.,2
"Absolutely amazing experience, good service, ambiance and food is outstanding! Can never go wrong with Blueblood Steakhouse!!",4
Excellent experience. Food was hot and arrived in a time let manner. The waiter was both knowledgeable and personable. Overall great experience!,4
"Dinner was good maybe my expectations were to high. Ordered oysters expected freshly schucked oysters but were dry with no oyster liquor but they were tastey.
Steak was good could not order one of there more elite steaks, so it was cooked perfectly but a little nervey. Salmon was great cooked perfectly. Sides were also good. Service from the time we got there till we left was great. The place was in the garden of cash loma, what more can you say. Was very happy with our experience.
Wish I could say I would return but I don't think I will. Too costly for myself.",3
"We celebrated our anniversary at Blueblood steakhouse, the staff was very friendly and welcoming, our server was very kind and with knowledgeable recommendations regarding the food and beverage.",4
It was my sisters birthday and the food was delicious! I did a full review on my tik tok @foodie036,4
Didn't like deserts. Everything else was find. Need to improve variety and selection of deserts.,3
"Wedding anniversary. We got married at Casa Loma a few years back and always celebrate our wedding anniversary at Blue Bloods. The food, setting, etc. was wonderful as always. Our service was subpar for Blue Bloods and he was very slow and didn‚Äôt seem interested in our table, but was very friendly and engaging to every other table around us. We‚Äôve never experienced that at Casa Loma or Blue Bloods so it was odd.",2
"DISAPPOINTED specifically for the quality of food vs. the price. I reviewed the menu before we went, I understood the price and had high expectations of the the quality which was just was not delivered upon. When you're paying that much you want to walk away thinking ""that was the best meal, ever!"" I walked away with MAJOR REGRET that we didn't just go to The Keg. 

Casa Loma itself is beautiful, 10/10 location, just sad the rest of the experience didn't match. I would go back to the castle for a day visit but I will not recommend nor return to BlueBlood to eat again.",2
"Amazing food & amazing service 
Had an amazing time",4
Lovely birthday!!,4
"Fantastic service, incredible venue, delicious food, fair price for the package. Only comment would be turning up the AC when it's especially hot or humid..",4
"We had a bad seating area and the place was on renovation so very limited space. 

I got no view, more like jam to one corner. Parking wasn't that great. It wasn't a pleasant experience for my first time being there.  The food is too too small portion.",0
"I have been to BlueBlood many times, and it is one of my favourite restaurants in the city, however this past dining experience shows that it has changed, and not for the better. The patio is beautiful has been set up very well. Overall the food was great, but both mine and my date‚Äôs steak were a full notch undercooked. Mine was supposed to be Medium, and came out medium rare, his was supposed to be medium-rare and came out rare. They were corrected, but it puts a damper on a very expensive meal. The service was where things were really lacking though. Our server was basically non existent. Our wine and waters has to be filled up by us, or passing staff. He didn‚Äôt come to apologize for the steaks, and had us waiting for over 20 minutes after our food was done with no one coming by. We eventually asked who I assume was the floor manager to ask for our bill, which she then brought to us. She was lovely however, brought our re done steaks out, had checked on us a couple of times, and apologized at the end of the meal. On a $500 meal, the service needs to be excellent, and it has been every time I‚Äôve been there in the past, but unfortunately it seems that BlueBlood isn‚Äôt holding itself to the same high standards it used to have.",1
"Amazing service, delicious food, cocktails and wine , amazing view of gardens, CN tower &  the city enjoyed on a beautiful terrace in a castle‚Ä¶ Thanks BlueBlood & Liberty Entertainment for a wonderful dining experience.",4
"A beautiful restaurant, good service, and delicious food - made the special occasion even more special!",4
"Very good impression, the service is amazing and the food is very good !",4
"Great ambiance, delicious food and excellent service!",4
"Great food, excellent service (thank you David so much) and incredible ambiance!",4
"Our waiter Isaac was amazing, very helpful and informative when it came to recommendations and the menu. We will definitely be returning!",4
Connor our server was amazing! Food came out quickly and was delicious!,4
"I don‚Äôt want the servers to feel bad - they are pleasant and doing their best - but this restaurant isn‚Äôt even as good as the Keg. It seems to be popular simply because it‚Äôs so expensive people can relish the snob appeal of it ‚ÄúI can afford it and you can‚Äôt‚Äù. The ambience is meh. The service is pleasant but nowhere near the caliber of other top tier steak places in the city. The food is over priced and not great - my premium wagyu steak was over salted to the point of being inedible AND they brought me MORE fancy salts because I might want to my meat to taste of road salt while I die of a hypertensive crisis and sodium toxicity. The table side Caesar was excellent but that‚Äôs hardly enough to justify the enormous prices here. Dress code was ‚Äújacket preferred‚Äù but the clientele was largely dressed in trashy, overpriced t-shirts and jeans. For a special atmosphere pick someplace else where both the clientele and staff agree upon creating a formal, treasured experience rather than just bragging rights to having taken selfies of mediocre Veblen food.",1
Lobster in the Mac n cheese was chewy/rubbery and brioche bun was very tough to bite into. The view was gorgeous waiter provided excellent service.,3
everything was so delicious and quite the experience!! :),4
"Absolutely delicious,  well worth the money.  Service is amazing, location is beautiful and the food is top notch. Make sure to dress up, this is no space to dress casual. Will visit again!",4
Service was great and we were there on our anniversary and they gave us a little gift which was very nice.  Steak was amazing. appetizers we also good and generous size.  Will be back againüëçüèΩüëçüèΩ,4
"Food was beyond amazing and had large quantities, we ordered a lot of different things thinking ‚Äúfancy restaurant with high prices it will be small portions‚Äù but honestly the asparagus had to been about 2 bunches, the portions are huge and well worth the price. What we ordered could of fed four people. And everything was cooked to perfection. 
The setting was gorgeous, view was amazing, and the server, Gio i believe, was beyond friendly and attentive. 
I loved the whole experience, we will be going back for sure, and we have already recommended this place to more than a couple people and its only been a day.",4
We were there for my husband's birthday. Great service and food was amazing.,4
very pleasant waitress and helpers. food excellent,4
Another great experience! Our server Stephen was so nice and helpful! Definitely recommend blue blood!,4
"Had a wonderful evening. The ambiance was great, the food was delicious and most of all the service was outstanding. This was topped up by the wonderful gift we were offered for our 46th wedding anniversary. 
Thank you.",4
"It was our anniversary and we came by for the first time. Food was great, however I did not like where we were seated. There was no view of anything as we were placed by the corner of the building and it was too quiet for my liking.",2
Thank you so much everything was great,4
The food was very mediocre. The lobster bisque was not hot enough and it was a little bland. All the food wasn‚Äôt hot enough except for the apple pie at the end.  The service and ambiance was great though!,2
My husband and I went here for the first time. It was his birthday and I must say we will definitely come back. I have to admit I was concerned as I had read some really bad reviews. Our server Steven was amazing! The food was exactly what I expected meaning it was spectacular. The steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare. We had such an amazing time and did not feel rushed.  All staff were friendly and they all looked like they were having as much fun as all the customers. The best customer experience I have ever had. I had mentioned that they had the oldest wine cellar and it was found while they were doing renovations. So they took us downstairs for a tour. My husband and I have not been out to a restaurant because of the pandemic so this was our first outing and it was way past our expectations. Thank you to the wonderful team at BlueBlood Steakhouse for such a wonderful time!!,4
Excellent service and ambiance! We were able to walk around the premises and castle. Even a walk through the underground tunnel for free as an experience after dinner. The food is a bit pricey but very delicious!,4
"Amazing date location. All the tables around us got a heater and I got told "" I'll see if I can get a hold of a blanket for you"" . I 100% felt the waiter treated us different because we were younger. At first we were seated in a dark corner by where the staff comes out and asked to move, other than that everything was amazing",3
"Food being served  on the patio did not come out hot. $200+ Kobe A5 steaks should be at optimal temperature. Sides were too greasy.
Total for the meal for 2 minus dessert, including tax and tip was $700+. 
Steak had a test cut from the kitchen to check if it was was cooked medium rare, something a home cook would do.
Service was just ok, not good at accommodating or suggesting anything for egg allergy.",1
"Food was just okay - nothing spectacular.  Exterior of the building is great!  Service was decent, about on par with what you would expect.  

Absolutely terrible with managing communication with guests - no one answers the phone or returns calls and we literally had to visit on-site to get a question answered about whether the patio was covered in the event of rain - which it is.

Unless you want to check out the building, not worth bothering, much better spots in the city for premium steak, / dinning, etc.",2
Birthday for my wife,4
"Sat out on the patio.  Felt good to be out.  This is a lovely spot.  The service was really spotty in part because there was a big table right beside us demanding a lot of ‚Äòour‚Äô server‚Äôs time.  The steaks are good, but not amazing.  When the prices are this steep, the end product should be better.",1
"Very expensive, not enough variety/choices for kids/teens",1
"Celebrated parents 50th Wedding Anniversary. The meal was incredibly delicious, the service was fantastic, and the ambiance was perfect. This will always be a highly memorable experience for everyone. Highly recommend dining here for any occasion. The proof is in the quality of food.",4
"View and drinks were nice, but food was horrible.",1
"Actually we are not very satisfied overall. The server was great, but there is miscommunication for the order. We were confirmed the price before they proceed. It was my husband birthday and was my parents treats. It was so shocked when we saw the bill. Since we already confirmed we order 1 seafood for the appetizer but it came out for price for 4! It was so embrass when we pay for the bill. I would like to speak to the managers for this issue. We don‚Äôt mind to pay for that but the fact that we already confirmed are we going to have only one order once we saw the menu. It‚Äôs no point to argue in the restaurant but is a very bad experience since we already ask couple times before we confirmed the order!",1
"I ordered the Short Rib Wellington and found the meat very dry. I stopped half way through. The AAA Alberta Sirloin requested medium rare came as requested but did not cut easily. We even exchanged knives hoping it was the knife but wasn't.  I was waiting for our server to ask how we enjoyed our dinner but that never happened.  Our table side Ceasar Salad was delicious. Other than the ambiance,  we would not be too anxious to return anytime soon.",1
Food came late and steak cooked totally wrong. Had to leave without eating dinner because of how slow food was and had an engagement. This was to celebrate our 5th year wedding anniversary and we got married at Casa Loma.  Terrible experience,0
Fabulous from start to finish.,4
Wonderful experience Highly recommend we will be back,4
This is a place for a delicious dinner with someone special. The view of Toronto is amazing at night.,3
For the first time customers we are very happy we went it was phenomenal Experience the food was delicious portions were amazing service was five star excellent the restaurant was gorgeous beautiful atmosphere overall fun and lovely experience will Definitely come back and recommend,4
Our server Connor was amazing! We took him up on the recommendations for short rib ravioli as an appetizer and lobster mac and cheese and broccolini for sides and he couldn‚Äôt have been more spot on. Each dish was so delicious. The steaks were also cooked perfectly. We will be back for indoor dining in the fall!,4
"A great view of the city from the Casa Loma patio.  If you want to treat someone special to a memorable night out, this restaurant is an excellent choice. Appetizers are worth every penny.  The steak is served alone, on a cast iron tray/pan. We ordered veggies and starches and shared them. Caesar salad is made right next to your table. It is quite a treat. Portions are very reasonable. Servers at the restaurant are incredible. Justina was the server who made our dining experience enjoyable. We will definitely return.",4
"Great ambience, servers were helpful and kind! Great way to celebrate my birthday.",3
"Was great service and atmosphere! Octopus was great but bisque and steak were not fantastic ‚Ä¶very good, but not great which was expected considering the price tag. 
The cocktails were great.  
Was a nice night out, but I‚Äôd get an entree next time instead of steak",4
"Unfortunately we had a very bad experience in such a nice settings.
The salad was prepared ahead of time and was not fresh,seafood tower was just ok. 
The worst part was that our waiter did not pay attention to us , did not serve  us with wine or water. We have to reach out few times to the side table and serve ourselves. The waiter came by our table 3 times: at the time of the order, when he served the food and when we paid our bill . $350 for appetizers with no service is not worth it! 
We will never come back! We are lucky that our city has many other good places to get excellent service and amazing food.",0
"Beautiful setting, wonderful food and staff ( Trevor) that went out of their way to make our experience something really special. Thank you!",4
"Amazing experience! It is pricey but well worth it for the service, good and location!",3
Amazing! By far the best steakhouse in the city. The experience is worth talking about even days after!,4
"everything was awesome but if you are going to sit on the patio, make sure you pick your spot...i have no idea why but there were some way better tables open and they tried to sit us on the side of the castle facing the parking lot !!!! 

The service staff was awesome, the food was awesome but the hostesses and phone staff could improve.

will definitely go back",4
Food was amazing,4
"We went there mostly for the beautiful view of the castle. The food was so-so to taste and the portions are very small. The only dish I truly enjoyed was the appetizer (octopus). That was delicious.  Overall, I've had better food experience at Harbour 60. 
Our server was good, but the floor manager or I'm not sure who he was,  was a bit snooty. 
I would not recommend that place, unless someone really wants the castle experience.",2
"Exquisite food, from appetizer to dessert everything was delicious, perfectly presented and carefuly prepared. The service was perfect, our waitress was so kind, really courteous and knowledgeable. We had a very pleasant evening.",4
Came for my girlfriends birthday. Food was served cold. Waiter paid no attention to our table. Had to ask other servers to place orders. For the price the service should be top tier but this is easily the worst restaurant I‚Äôve ever been too.,0
Lovely as always great food and friendly staff we sat outdoors so the ambiance was exceptional more so we had the view of the city,4
"We thoroughly enjoyed this visit!  Food was tasty and presented well.  Service deserves a five star!  Kudo's to Justina, our server, Tatziana & Mosa (our ceasar salad presenter they all had beautiful personalities.

The only mention we have is that we expected the octopus to be grilled although it was very tender.",4
The server named Donaldo gave my date and I a great experience while dining! I would highly recommend coming here for a special occasion!,4
"The atmosphere was beautiful, food was tasty! Luca took very good care of us. Would definitely recommend for a date night!",4
"First time here, I was very impressed with the impeccable service and the food was everything we expected and more.  Steak cooked to perfection as well the Wagu Burger which I would highly recommend.  Would love to have had better seating for the view but we know this was limited to reservation.  There was a specially nice touch with small gift from the restaurant as we were celebrating a birthday........would definitely recommend and hope to return to BlueBlood Steakhouse sometime soon.",4
"Wonderful place, fair prices, excellent service. The food and wine were fantastic.",4
"Service was great, staff is amazing.  Highly recommend",4
Always a great experience at BlueBlood! Dinner was amazing and the steaks were cooked to perfection.,4
"Steaks and sides were a big disappointment.  The steaks were not cooked to preferred doneness, even after being sent back to the kitchen, they returned to the table way undercooked.  The quality of the food was lacking for the price.  When you go to a steakhouse of this caliber and spend $250+ on the steaks alone you expect perfection.  The handcut duck fat kennebec fries tasted of burned/old oil, and the mushroom side was plain field mushrooms with one chanterelle. The tuna tartare was SPECTACULAR. The waiter and sommelier provided exceptional service. A personalized Birthday card and gift were a nice touch, although not enough to be returning here anytime soon.",2
"Very good service. Food was okay,  but not at the price point.",2
Some guest making to much noise but overall good place,4
We had an amazing experience!  It was a beautiful setting and the food was absolutely delicious.  Our service was outstanding- thank you!  I will be back for sure!,4
"Seemingly a disconnect with timing of wait staff.
Bread came before water or cocktails, water spilled on my lap as waited reached over. 
No wine recommended for steak pairing‚Ä¶bottom line not gray service for the price.",0
Service and food is always top notch. Took a client and his wife our for dinner with my wife. Client even had some special request for off menu items. The chef came through with flying colours. Highly recommend,4
Great steak and excellent amenities. Better to create a ‚Äúfly-free‚Äùatmosphere for indoor dining. The service was not consistent either.,3
"The service could improve a little bit more.  The first impression the family had was that the service thought that we would no be worthy and the bill would be small.  The family was celebrating an important milestone and when we aren‚Äôt regular customers, we had the opportunity to enjoy and expend on this luxury place.

Things got better by the end of the dinner but the night started with a bitter sweet sense.  This could be a perception only where the service we had in other places have been outstanding,  it might be that the style is different.",3
"Wonderful experience at Blue Blood. Gorgeous scenery, attentive service and mouth watering meal! Highly recommend the caesar salad & the rib eye. Parking needs to be addressed, as there simply isn't enough for both restaurants, but overall a lovely evening.",4
"Brilliant. Incredible service from the moment we first walked in, to the closing anniversary gift. Blueblood has it figured out. We came for the steaks and they did not disappoint. Cooked perfectly, accompanied by great sides and some wonderful wine, it was a perfect dinner. But even more, I commend the incredible service, be it from our server or from the plethora of staff making sure that the night ahead was perfect in every way for us. Would highly recommend.",4
I love this restaurant it is a bit pricey but it‚Äôs worth it . This was my second time visiting and I will definitely go again. Great food and service,4
"I really enjoyed my experience here. The location is superb and the service was top notch. I started with the kale salad and the octopus - both cooked perfectly. For my main, I chose the dry aged striploin. Cooked medium rare I found it a bit too dry - the steak was not juicy and basically well done at the ends... I would get a filet the next time. The coconut pie was to die for - maybe the best in Toronto. As a top end steakhouse... I needed the steak to be perfect, so 4/5.",3
Was disappointed that we had to wait half an hour for a table that I had a reservation for. The host was going to sit us at a huge table that was off to the side (only 2 ppl) away from a fantastic view while there were other tables on the terrace that were available with a better view. The tables looked super unkept (you can tell there was a rush and they were falling behind) Service was EXTREMELY SLOW and we hardly got checked on. (We got sat at 930pm and I did not pay my bill until 12am) I got a GLASS of Chardonnay and the waiter charged me $115 (for a bottle). Overall was super disappointed with the experience considering BlueBlood is held to such a high regard. Would not recommend this place and left super unsatisfied.,1
Excelent food and service I recommend for especial ocassion,4
My only comment is the steak we asked for as medium rare but it was every so slightly over done. Everything else was lovely.,4
"This was the first nice place my husband and I went to in a year.  We sat out on the patio, we had a gorgeous view of the skyline.  The service was outstanding!  We felt like royalty.  
It was worth every penny.",4
Our server was amazing and most courteous! Helping us with recommendations and was on point with everything!,4
"Great ambiance and food!
Our server was amazing!
Highly recommended",3
Always an excellent experience whenever we dine here and last night was another prime example of excellent food and service,4
"Everything was amazing but the crab cakes ( heavy and dense dough, dry with almost no crab meat in it)",4
Service and food were incredible! All the staff knew if you were dining for a special occasion and even sent us home with a nice congratulations card.,4
10/10 would suck d*ck for this steak. Vibes were immaculate,3
Amazing service and food,4
Very nice place and great service. Prices high but I guess the castle is worth the experience.,3
"First time dining on their patio. The views are incredible, food was amazing too. We were celebrating my husband‚Äôs birthday and our server, Stephen made our experience really nice.",4
Very good experience!! I would recommend to a friend.,3
"Food was terrific, seats were decent, prices were very reasonable. Only thing that stuck out negatively for me was that our waiter seemed reluctant to take our order when we said we wanted a coke. His face turned upside down the moment we asked for it. It could have been our imagination which is why we‚Äôre not making a big deal out of this. The bill still came out to be about $300 with a 20% tip to make it $370 so I‚Äôm not sure why he seemed upset (if he actually was). Anyways it was still a pretty good experience for us so expect to see us again.",4
"Amazing!!! First indoor seating of summer 2021! 
Can‚Äôt wait to go back‚Ä¶.",4
"Its not a bad restaurant, the location is great and feels amazing to eat at a castle. Service is fine, very millennial not a classy steakhouse service, but feels more like an upscale Bar/Restaurant in the the city. Food was meh. Tuna tartar tasted off, crab cakes tasted more like cornmeal with peppers. Their Wagyu A5 stake was nice, it really felt like someone slapped it on a grill, flipped it over and served it. So great ambience, ok service, bad food. 

When I told people I was going there, they told me it was a tourist trap. Unfortunately they were right. 

I could see taking someone here for a business lunch or whatever, where the food is not as important.",1
"Celebrated my birthday here and had a horrible experience. Requested the hostess over the phone to seat us outside on the patio, which she said they would accommodate. When we got there we were told all the patio tables were full and we would have to sit indoors (understandable).
The table we were given was the size of two shoeboxes to the point where our plates didn‚Äôt fit. My partner let the waiter know we were celebrating my birthday and at the end they brought us 2 raspberries with a 3-inch sliver of chocolate that said ‚Äúhappy birthday‚Äù. After our dinner we looked over to the table of teenagers next to us and saw the waiter bring out a complimentary dessert (ice cream and pastry) for one of the girls who was celebrating her birthday. Not sure why we received 2 raspberries while they got a full complimentary dessert.
The inside of the restaurant is also extremely hot and stuffy on a warm day. My partner and I normally love expensive steakhouses, but this place was not worth it at all. The food and drinks were both mediocre. I almost prefer the food at lower end steakhouses like the keg..",0
"Beautiful Ambience, awful food! Quality and taste was very disappointing to say the least. The saying you get what what you pay for does not apply to this steakhouse! We asked for medium steak that came out almost charred and burnt. Alaskan crab frites were more like bathed in batter and could be called falafels instead!",2
"Love coming here, will come back. Worth the price",4
"Blue Blood is always one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. Impeccable venue, excellent service, spectacular ambiance. Cocktails are top notch. They are not inexpensive but totally not over priced with the generous portion and good quality of food. I was impressed by the stunningly beautiful patio setting. I definitely had an enjoyable evening there.",4
"Just a great experience. Everything was delicious down to the last bite. Table was cleaned between courses, staff were attentive. Area was set up for rain or shine. The only sad part was we couldn‚Äôt access the garden.",4
"Great meal! Our server David was excellent, view was spectacular. Well done",4
Great location but patio could be nicer with more flowers.  Food is excellent.  Caesar salad was amazing.  Profiteroles were special.   Nice friendly service.  Washrooms need more routine attention.  Overall a nice place to dine with friends.,4
"We came to celebrate our friends birthday. From the service we received from Kosta to the food and atmosphere, we couldn‚Äôt ask for a more perfect evening. We are looking forward to returning in the next few weeks to enjoy again.",4
Delicious food and wonderful service. Beautiful and quiet ambiance.,4
"Was very excited to experience BlueBlood for a celebratory meal, but a little disappointing. The hostess tried to sit the 3 of us at 6 person table, which had been soaking wet from the rain. We all ordered 12oz strip loins to be cooked to medium, they came to our table  absolutely raw. Our waiter was the sweetest man, but had so many tables to tend to that we barely saw him. Overall the Caesar salad and the raspberry sorbet were the highlights of the meal.",2
"The food is overpriced. Our steak while we asked for it to be medium rare it was blue and despite the waiter taking it back for it to be cooked again it was quite rare 


But the ambiance and view is spectacular",4
"The food at Blue Blood is consistently excellent.  The menu offers a large selection of delicious food.
I think that they did an excellent job building the individual see through tents to accomodate requirements for the pandemic.  The tents also offer good protection from the weather as well as a private ambiance.
My compliments, to the waiters and servers who did an excellent job last night during a big rain and wind storm.  They all did their very best and all of it with a smile.
In addition to the excellent food, the patio offers great view and the indoor restaurant is tastefully decorated.
All in all, it is a place we keep going back when we want to enjoy a great evening out.",4
This is our second time at blue blood their food and drinks are good. They should allow us to taste the wine before choosing one.,3
"The location is beautiful - the perfect place to be on a summer evening.  The service is excellent. The food, however, is average at best. Such a shame. It is too expensive for average food. Also, be prepared to pay for parking at the restaurant.",2
"Our experience was amazing! From the service to the food, we had a great time. Highly recommend!",4
Masks should be better enforced for guests when they are inside using restrooms or moving throughout the dining space.,3
"It was wonderful, waygu melted right in your mouth!",4
"Amazing service and great food ! Our server, Ian, was exceptional ! Would definitely go back.",4
"Loved the salmon tartare, and ahi tuna

Steak is amazing too. Smoked salmon was super fresh.",4
"Ridiculously overpriced for what you get. I‚Äôve had better tasting bbq‚Äôed grass fed beef on my backyard patio for a fraction of the price. Lovely view of the Toronto skyline and facade of Casa Loma but you did not get the feeling you were dining at a top restaurant. Plastic tables and chairs. No table linen. In comparing this outdoor experience to European outdoor dining experiences of similar price point we‚Äôve had in the past, BlueBlood‚Äôs patio dining has a long way to go.",2
An amazing experience! Ambiance was fabulous and the service was impeccable. The food was extremely delicious and there is a good variety! I would recommend you check it out!,4
"Great atmosphere and amazing food!
Enjoyed the music.",4
"It was my girls 40th, everything was perfect. 
The food was cooked to perfection and the wine suggestion was spot on. 
Thank you",4
Everything was perfect. Our server Alex was wonderful. Had a great time.,4
"Fantastic views. Beautiful fountain. Spent over $1500 for 4 people and was left disappointed. Seafood tower @$70 per person was very limited although the seafood that was there was very fresh and tasty.  The table side caesar salad was great. Fois gras was my favourite dish of the night. Cocktails were 70% ice (literally). The worst part was the steak. We ordered a medium rare tomahawk and the wagyu tasting. Tomahawk was dry and burnt on the outside and so raw on the inside that we had to send pieces back to be cooked. Wagyu was horrible. Looked like they microwaved it. I have no idea what they are doing in the kitchen. The lobster mac and cheese was great. The creme brulee was delicious. The banana flambe was ruined with all the oranges they added. No banana flavour. All in all, nice experience but I won't be returning.",1
"Overrated restaurant , you can get better food anywhere else , nothing special ! 
The host at the door was very unprofessional for being such an ‚Äúupscale‚Äù restaurant . We got sited right by a door so a lot of food traffic all the time . 
The food was not as we asked , it also had no taste ! 
The best part was our waiter he was great and very pleasant",1
"Gorgeous walking up to the castle but a disappointment being sat along the side of the building rather than the back. So no view which is what you‚Äôre expecting. Much better to eat at their other restaurant where all the tables are in the garden so that‚Äôll be our preference. Kids liked it much better. Service by hostesses was friendly but we had a waiter who was inattentive. For ambience, garden restaurant much better and for steakhouse, we much rather other places in the city.",2
"One of the most expensive restaurant I've visited. With four of us, and with not everyone ordering steaks, and the final bill before tips was $600+.",4
The most beautiful spot in the city.  Food and service was a 5 star experience.  Amazing!!!,4
"Wonderful service , food and view !! Thank",4
"It wasn‚Äôt anything near my expectations. Way too expensive. We got charged for parking and $10 for flat water!!! 
Too noisy and we could barely hear the music.
We asked to change tables 3 times not to be behind the wall.
Overall, it was not a good experience for spending $300!!!! Would not ever recommend.",1
"We asked for different table, hostess did not come back for 10 mins. 
Dry aged steak was very nice. Triple A steak was ok.
Their caesar salad is must! 
The $10 sauce for the steak did not go with the steak. 
 They should work on the steak sauce little bit more.
For the steak house, I would not recommend. Other than beautiful view of Casa Roma... I would say 2/5",1
Food was average at best. Overpriced for what you actually get.,1
"We over our time at Blu blood. The ambiance is like none other. Especially coming out of pandemic. It was very special to be in such a unique place. The staff was polite and conscientious. 
We have dined all over the world and I just feel that for the $$$$ the caliber of the meal was just not there. That‚Äôs not to say We didn‚Äôt enjoy our food but it wasn‚Äôt memorable.",3
"Beautiful view from the table, excellent service but too highly priced for the greasy not overly delicious food.",3
Quality of food was disappointing.,2
Anniversary,4
"nice service was good. People,  were very friendly",3
Loved it like always lol,4
"Beautiful setting, food was good, service was very slow.",1
"I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a coincidence or not, but we were put on a table which directly faced to the CN tower and the night scene was beautiful. Our server was so friendly and kind. I recommend choose the lobster mac&cheese for the side, it was awesome!!",4
"Very good experience, highly recommended for everyone",4
"Excellent, excellent service. Best restaurant service I‚Äôve seen in years. Professional. Relaxed. Sommelier is also excellent. Food is excellent. Venue excellent. Highly recommend. Expensive.",4
First outing since Covid so thoroughly enjoyed it!,4
Our server Isaac was very professional and provided excellent service with outstanding good character. We had an amazing time at BlueBlood and will be sure to return for the table side baked Alaska again another time!,4
The service was incredible! The server we had and the sommelier were delightful and made great recommendations. We were able to sit and enjoy and not feel rushed. The patio overlooking the city is absolutely stunning! Would recommend for a special occasion or an amazing night out.,4
There should be a way to book a table with the cn tower view vs walkway tables,3
Amazing food! Staff was friendly & helpful! Food & drinks came on time! Definitely recommend & will be back!,4
"Great atmosphere, food is amazing and the service is top notch, a bit pricey but that is kinda expected.",3
Highly recommend! Private covered seating per group. Staff are highly knowledgeable and very pleasant. All items we ordered ranged from very good to excellent.,4
Wagyu tasting menu and foie gras were delicious. Very knowledgeable sommelier,4
Great evening however we found the wagyu over seared.,4
"Our first time going, very nice experience. Would definitely recommend this to everyone. üòäüôåüèæüôåüèæüëçüèΩü•Çüè∞",4
Love outdoor dining for a lovely Summer night! Beautiful view and excellent service! Definitely GO AGAIN!!!A little bit pricy but worth the money for occasion.,4
An amazing meal in a really lovely setting.  We thoroughly enjoyed it.,4
"Amazing food, large outdoor patio...will visit again",4
Disaster service. Steaks have a plastic texture. Fish are frozen and not fresh. The only great thing about this restaurant is the VIEW.,0
"We come here a few times a year to celebrate birthdays or anniversaries, and we love it. The food and service is great! The patio ambiance gets better every year too. The indoors (when indoor dining is allowed), is so gorgeous and we were worried that the patio wouldn‚Äôt provide the special ambience, but it does! We will continue to come here annually,  and are grateful to live so close to this gem.",4
"Staff was amazing, food was great. We did not wait log to be seated either",4
"Our first experience, and it was amazing! We truly enjoyed everything we ordered! From the cocktails, to the bottle of wine, to the apps to our entrees. Highly recommend BlueBlood! It just felt so magical. We had the water fountain and the city view as our background. Our waiter Sergio was outstanding! So helpful with the menu in any questions we had. Before our entrees even arrived I already made another reservation to go back! Looking forward to our next reservation in august for my fianc√©‚Äôs birthday.",4
"The food was fantastic as usual, the steaks were flavourful and juicy and cooked to melt in your mouth perfection. The sides were plentiful and the table side ceasar salad was impressive.
The atmosphere could have been better, the patio felt a little bare and haphazard, maybe some decor or flowers would help. There were young children wandering around and trying to climb over the rails, which spoiled the ambiance a little.
The server was unable to split the bill between us and another couple, he did not notify us in advance that we'd have to keep separate tabs or if it's only one bill per table.
We've been to the indoor dining room several times and for this price point I was a little underwhelmed by the patio experience.",3
"My food was over salted , starter and main also. But the service was impeccable so when I mentioned it to the waiter that my main dish has way too much salt on it, it's was changed immediately. we also got the dessert compliment from the chief and I got a small gift because it was my birthday month ( not a day but a month) which was very nice of them and it's was a delightful surprise.  My girlfriends enjoyed their meal though very much. Overall I enjoyed this place and would come back again. Hopefully less salt next time lol)",4
Great service & the food is to die for. I love this place.,4
"Akhbar was an amazing server 
He made all the difference",4
"Great date night. Amazing view.
Tried the tuna tartare- my favorite and the prima rose drink - delicious.
Great atmosphere.
Would recommend for date night!",4
Second time visiting this restaurant. Service was amazing . Connor was so knowledgeable and attentive with our table. Food was great and so was the ambience.,3
"Dinner and service was great, we would definitely recommend.",4
"You would think dining in a castle the service would be stuffy and pretentious, but it‚Äôs the exact opposite. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, you will receive excellent, attentive service, but you‚Äôll get it with friendliness and a smile. My husband and I love this place. The atmosphere is gorgeous, the service is awesome and the food is amazing. You‚Äôre going to spend a lot, but really, it‚Äôll be worth it. Always a memorable night guaranteed.",4
I took my husband for his birthday. Our waiter Connor was fantastic! We can‚Äôt wait to come back.,4
"Definitely our favourite place!

Best in the city!",4
"The overall experience was okay. We ordered the lobster bisque, it should have been heavier and cream based but this was very very watery. We then ordered the crab fritters. They were amazing till I took my last bite. The last bite had bones in it! They did take the meal back and took both the bisque and fritters off our bill. I ordered the short rib Wellington as my entree and it was delicious. It was just very very meaty. It can also feed 2 people.",3
Beautiful experience!,4
"This is a place where you are served like a royal and the food is excellent! I only wish we were able to sit on the patio overlooking a much nicer view of the gardens and the CN Tower :(.  We sat in one of the tents... not bad, but not much of a view!",4
"Yes, the meal is expensive - but everything from the food, service to the ambience is lux.

Oysters were such a treat- fresh and the garnishes were perfect. For me, the crab cakes outshined the ravioli but still really enjoyed it. 

We shared a wagyu steak, with the mushroom and duck fat fries sides. I am forever spoiled by the wagyu and although I‚Äôm obsessed with bernaise sauce the 3 salts were enough to enjoy. 

Cocktails are well balanced, tried the pineapple rum cocktail, Paloma and Mai Tai. 

Ended the meal on the decadent molten lava cake that was too good not to finish, that meringue was a welcomed addition! 

Luca took such great care of us, it was such a personal experience even with his mask on we had great recommendations, convo and laughs.",4
"Fantastic food, ambiance and service, best steak in Toronto!",4
"Not my first time at BlueBlood Steakhouse, in fact I‚Äôm a regular. the first time was A very nice experience but I must say this time was not that bad but also not the best. I‚Äôm very disappointed in the fact that they had cancelled my reservation the Easter Sunday and had promised me a gift card for my next reservation through voicemail and speaking with reservationist. I had called to speak with the manager regarding my gift card for my next visit which was July 1 and I was told it was a miscommunication on their end which I find is not fair. Furthermore, I had told the server That I was a pescatarian meaning I don‚Äôt eat any red meat items. That being said I absolutely love their octopus but after telling the server I don‚Äôt eat meat and my other allergies my octopus still came out with pork sausages which I was very bothered by. I ordered the Seabass and it was undercooked so I had subbed it for a salmon which was amazing. Drinks took a while to come out where as the server even asked us ‚Äúoh you never got it yet‚Äù.? You can tell the servers are burnt out. Although she was very apologetic and sweet. I was just hoping for that same overall experience I had the first time.",2
"Amazing experience, would recommend to anyone! This really is an amazing restaurant .The setting ,food and service all perfect .The service is attentive without being overbearing. We would return in a heartbeat.",4
"Konstantinos the waiter was absolutely awesome!
Everything was WONDERFUL!!!!
Happy to return manu times!",4
It was an amazing experience and I plan on coming back again! I will definitely recommend this place as both the food and ambience was amazing.,4
Was perfect,4
"This is our spot, we love the ambience, the view, the service and the vegan food!  Yes, vegan food!!  The servers are always very accommodating and the kitchen staff does a great job!  The sides for us are a perfect meal, the vegetable selections are perfect.  Our treat is the thick cut french fries and double order of mushrooms!  Even though a steak/seafood house it would be great for the restaurant to offer a vegan menu.  Especially for those who do not know how to pick out what can be made vegan.  The atmosphere alone is well worth dining here and no one should miss out!!  And still worth the effort for the establishment (our bill was over $450 - no complaints at all).  Thank you for another beautiful night!!",4
Incredible food and service. Both are next level.,4
"Always stunned by how gorgeous Casa Loma is - attention to detail is flawless. Drinks, dinner, everything was delicious without a doubt‚Ä¶ but the staff are everything! They make a nice dinner into whole experience. Everyone we met gave great recommendations, so attentive to allergies, answered all my dumb questions, simply really nice people who are fun and comfortable to met.",4
We enjoyed celebrating our 37th anniversary along with your awesome staff! Thank you!,4
The view was very nice!!!!,4
We ordered the seafood tour and found it extremely dry.  The grilled octopus was dry and tough. It did take a long time for our server to arrive.  Overall i probably would choose another restaurant next time,1
The waiters are very helpful and know everything about everything on the menu. I recommend the Oysters and the Canadian AAA steaks! The steaks we're done perfectly,4
"The service was outstanding, the food was phenomenal, and the ambience felt like it was a European dining experience. I so recommend this place for a special occasion.",4
We went for our anniversary dinner! The food the service and the patio were outstanding! Made our day so special,4
An investment of outdoor freestanding ice mists are needed for the diners and the wait staff to keep ppl cool.,2
"The good didn‚Äôt taste good,
Octopus and chillian seabass tasted like boiled product. Crab cake was all breadcrumbs, maybe 5% crab. Salads nothing special too.
Foye gra was delicious and well prepared",1
"Wonderful venue!
Inventive food which is always presented as we love and expect 
Rare do you find Chateau D‚Äôquem on  the wine menu 
This ncredibly rare Sauternes  is exquisite and what a pleasant surprise to see it added the the wine menu
We go at least 3 times a year and have never been disappointed 

Marie & Chris",4
Excellent food and amazing service. I enjoyed my dinner very much. Thank you!!,4
"We had a lovely evening for a party of 5. Our server Connor was great. We ordered striploin steaks which tasted delicious along with broccolini, asparagus and mashed garlic potato. The non alcoholic beverages we tried were Berry splash & apple/mint which were a great choice of sweet/fruity type drinks. I highly recommend the profiterole and the apple pie for dessert! Definitely will visit again.",4
just perfect.. everything was wonderful and service was  perfect. will be visiting again soon,4
I went on my birthday. The location was so beautiful and i got lovely pictures. The food was nice and I was even gifted a fancy wine bottle cork as my birthday gift.,4
Good experience,4
"This place is not worth the hype. My steak didn‚Äôt taste good. The sides were okay. I wondered to myself if this was a steak house or a side house. My friend drink spilled and they didn‚Äôt care to replace they said they would charge. 

Just a weird dark atmosphere. Our server was nice but that‚Äôs pretty much it.",1
Great experience!,4
Keep up the great work!,4
"Flavorful food, professional service, will visit again and recommend to others! My sister and I had a good time!!",4
Great overall experience. Our server Conor was great. Food was exceptional.,4
"Place is magical, dining in a castle. Service was great, servers were so attentive and knowledgeable with the menu. In terms of food, i am not in awe cz we ordered steak medium but both came out wrong, one is raw and the other is super well done. We told the server bout it, so they change the other steak with a new one, but the one which is raw they took and cooked it again. The hype is just all about the ambience  which is the castle but in terms of food, this is not really the best place for steak.",3
"I came here with my boyfriend for our 1 year anniversary and we both were not disappointed. We loved everything about this restaurant! Although it was rainy, we had a great experience. We waited about 15 mins because they were backed up due to the weather (which is understandable). We really enjoyed the ambience of the place, especially at night. You can also see the view of the city!

The service was amazing! The server asked whether we wanted tap or sparkling water. He always refilled our waters without asking and refilled our wine glasses. He was very attentive to see if we were finished with our food. They noticed our table was a bit wobbly and fixed it right away. It‚Äôs the little details that go a long way.

We ordered the big eye tuna tartare, wagyu filet mignon and the bone-in centre cut striploin. It was pricey but of course you pay for the experience. We loved it and would highly recommend to come on a special occasion to celebrate!",4
"Everything about this outdoor dining experience was incredible: beautiful surroundings, amazing views, wonderful service, great wine.. the food however needs more attention.. we had to send back an appetizer and a main course. We were told by the staff that the restaurant is still in start up mode after the long closure (covid lockdowns).. but therefore they perhaps should shorten the menu as the place was packed with diners and the quality of the food was hit and miss for the high prices being charged. It is worth however paying more than an average fine dining experience for that incredible outdoor setting and view.",2
Amazing dinner with my son. They pulled out all the stops and even hand wrote a card for his graduation! Thanks to Akbar and the service team.,4
This place is a must food is incredible!! Service is perfection worth every dollar!!,4
"Great experience and great food served at blue blood. I just wished they wouldn‚Äôt acknowledged my husbands birthday after mentioning it in my rsvp, and to several staff members there.",4
"Great experience! Loved the food, service and overall atmosphere!",4
Trevor was an amazing server ! Ambiance gorgeous. Food lovely!,4
"It was my birthday. My bf and I are allergic to fish and shells
Fish. We told the waiter and he said he would make note of it the ceaser salad came with anchovies that we both cannot eat. He ignored us majority of the night. It took over 15mins to get a ketchup we asked for from another server because ours didn‚Äôt come by. The food is also over priced. The burger was extremely dry. The bread was really good. Would not recommend",0
Food is average and over priced,1
Everything was perfect from the food to the service to the atmosphere.,4
Ambience was gorgeous! Food was lovely as well as the server.,4
Went for my friends birthday and they were extremely accommodating and the vibe and food was great,4
"Came here for my birthday, food was great, service was not the best.",1
"Wonderful dinner.  Amazing service, beautiful views and the food was outstanding",4
"I want to send a huge THANK YOU to the staff for the amazing service & food my finance and I experienced yesterday evening. Thank you for making our anniversary celebration so wonderful and memorable!
Our waiter Donaldo was phenomenal!",4
Drop a knife and it was my wedding day. Waiter didnt care to ask if i need another one.,1
it was wonderful!,4
"Wildly over-priced but I would gladly pay the exhorbitant prices for a memorable meal, which this wasn't.  The service is woefully inadequate; I had to chase my server down three times despite it being a relatively quiet Monday night. Also should mention the  inappropriate music early in the evening which was clearly being played for the kitchen, not the customers.",1
"We celebrated Fathers Day here, the servers are amazing. The food is great. The only thing i didnt like is we paid for parking for $15 and we cant go to the fountain area, since we are dined upstairs. They locked the mini gates in the stairs and one of the servers told me we cant go there. But still, it was a very nice experience. Loved it!",3
"Gorgeous patio - view of the Toronto skyline from some tables, patio heaters etc so warm at night. The service was hit and miss, mostly miss. The waiter was cordial but the service received was second-rate, as other than the first course (of three), utensils arrived after the food was delivered and was sitting in front of us for some time. The steaks were both over-cooked to medium, not medium rare and we were told twice, both by the waiter and subsequently by the restaurant manager, that it was the lighting outside. When I picked up my filet and showed the waiter, he admitted it was definitely medium and this was before the manager came over. Communication is clearly lacking, which is also what the waiter said when the dessert arrived and was melting while we waited for utensils,  again.  I will say the tuna tartare and lobster bisque were both very good. I would skip the fries (too thick and no flavour) and order the truffle potato gratin as a side instead - it was wonderful and a generous portion as well. For just under $600 for two, including a $160 bottle of wine and tip, I would have expected not only a better meal, but better service. In addition, self-parking is now $15, not $10 - basically ridiculous.",2
"Amazing ! From start to finish ! Wait staff was amazingly attentive, and very courteous! The food was impeccable !",4
"Beautiful place, delicious food, accommodating staff",3
Father‚Äôs Day,3
Outstanding experience!! Staff was great,4
"Yesterday was my birthday and Father's Day, so my husband & I planned to attend for dinner. We arrived earlier than we had intended but were welcomed in immediately. We completed their covid-19 sign in on an online app, then downloaded the menu. As steak lovers that was what we had come for. The outdoor dining patio was immaculate and as more diners arrived we were all a proper distance apart. Our waiter, ""Sergio"" was fantastic, he helped us by offering specialty drinks (that I had asked about) and explained the questions we had about the menu. We felt like royalty & continually throughout our meal voiced to each other that we were coming back. When I booked the reservation online I had entered birthday in the occasion field but did not say anything else, yet when we ordered dessert it came with a chocolate Happy Birthday message and a candle. Our waiter also brought out a card and a complimentary Castle Loma/Bluebloods silver wine stopper. He had no idea how touched I was to receive that. The meal was perfect, cooked to order, tasted scrumptious and was perfectly proportioned.  I have 5,000 friends on Facebook so I plastered recommendations before we even left. We also work part-time for Corenews.ca and plan to put a recommendation on our ""Out and About"" page. Thank goodness we had our camera and our phones to take lots of pics. We will be back, and we are already sure many of our family and friends will also come to check it out. Thank you for an enjoyable birthday dinner. I have even already recommended to my boss that he should try it.",4
"Food is excellent and service is very professional, would definitely recommend.",4
"First time eating here and it was totally worth it, the experience & food made my birthday extra special we will be back forsure!",4
"Staff was friendly and open spirited, food was perfect, full of taste, I‚Äôll definitely be keeping my business meal there again.",4
Phenomenal dinner. Fantastic staff and incredible Atmosphere.,4
Connor our server was absolutely outstanding!!! The girl who made our Caesar salsa was wonderful too!! Fabulous experience and great evening!!,4
"The service was excellent, the food very good. However, the carbs should have been included in meal plan

We were hoping to 2 tables side by side. The tables are very small, not much room for four people at a table for four. 
Overall, good experience and the waiters do not hover around but are available when needed.",3
Amazing food and service!,4
"The experience was absolutely incredible. From being provided with an unbelievable table. Our server was simply the best server I have ever had at any restaurant in my entire life. Knowledgable engaging funny polite. After one small incident where I took a bite of something I should not have the manager Paul quickly insured that everything was OK, which it was, along with our server. I have eaten at  1 million restaurants ‚Ä¶from a remote unicorn find on a dirt road in Costa Rica To the most comically pretentious and expensive restaurants in Beverly Hills. Blue Blood steakhouse, along with my server, the experts explanation if our wine,  along with Paul made this within easily my top three dining experiences of my life life",4
Birthday for the girlfriend. Seating location was very good. We‚Äôll taken care of and food is very good. Worth it.,4
"Good and drinks no complaints‚Ä¶ pricey and delicious! The staff are friendly but don‚Äôt deliver at same level as other steak houses. The seating and table turnover is odd. 4/5 tables sat requested to be moved including myself. I booked and called in advance for a preferred table and year after year they get it wrong. The unisex washrooms don‚Äôt have a counter to put your bag on with a mirror. Mirrors are floor length in the common area.

It‚Äôs beautiful and tasty with so much potential but there‚Äôs something about the ambience that‚Äôs a miss. It‚Äôs a pricey night out and should be something special.",2
"This restaurant is overrated. Food was not impressive, we had salmon, tenderloin and lamb. Tenderloins nothing out of this world for the price and the lamb was not good at all. Staff were very polite, I general the service is very very good. Cutlery needs to be paid more attention as we have to change it several times as it was not fully clean. The overall experience was nice because of the venue.",2
"Amazing food,, service and overall experience. I would definitely recommend.",4
"We went for dinner this evening celebrating our babymoon. Isaac was our server and he made the whole evening. From the moment we sat down, his service went above and beyond what our expectations were. We never had to ask for anything. He was 3 steps ahead of us. What made him really so amazing, was that as professional as he was at his job, he made conversation and the time at the table completely comfortable, never any awkwardness. On top of the top notch service, the food was nothing short of delectable. Everything came out cooked to perfection and tasted heavenly. Would 100% dine here again, and would request to have Isaac as our server. Thank you for the great experience.",4
Had a lovely evening and waiter was terrific and helpful. Food was hot and delicious.,4
"The evening was a bit cool so the food got cold very quickly. The food was good but what over priced. I personally could have eaten better food for cheaper somewhere else. The ambiance was great, and did it for the experience.",2
An amazing place truly beautiful the service was outstanding our server Stephen what is his name I believe was very accommodating and extremely nice. We started off the night with oysters and the grilled octopus and they were both truly amazing and fresh one of the best oysters I‚Äôve ever had. for our main dinner we did get the Canadian AAA strip loin which unfortunately I can say was the worst steak I‚Äôve ever had it was extremely hard to cut into and had an awful smell. They were all very on top of the matter and made sure we got accommodated accordingly for the unfortunate matter. It was our first time dining here and unfortunately now even if we do go back for the seafood which was amazing we are cautious of trying any of the meats again which is very disappointing because I am a steak lover. But overall a very nice place. With a very nice staff.,3
"Our server Conner was amazing! Food, service, ambiance, drinks, outstanding. Oliver is such a great host as always. Highly recommend.",4
"We had 8pm reservation, arrived early at 7:50 and we were seated. Despite this there was l long delay in taking our order and the food did not arrive until 10. The vegetable salad etc were very goo but the steak had been sitting to long and was only warm. I was very disappointed since my two earlier visits had been excellent.we did not leave restaurant until after 11

"Incredible views on the patio, incredible marinated cherries in the whiskey sour",4
Exceptional service!! Server was wonderful and chef went above and beyond to accommodate a very serious allergy. Will definitely be back and will recommend without a doubt. Thank you for delicious food and an exceptional dining experience.,4
"The best part of our experience was the customer service. Our server was so attentive and friendly. I had the cocktail shrimp to start (the gin based cocktail sauce is delicious) and my boyfriend had the yellowfin tuna tartar. We both agreed it's the best tuna tartar we've had in the city. We each had the center-cut filet mignon steak and it was cooked to perfection. Last but not least, the view of the skyline was beautiful. We will definitely be back!",4
"Very good food with amazing view, highly recommended!",4
Great foods,4
It was amazing!! We had a great waiter named Donaldo who was very knowledgeable about steaks and we learned something new. Food was delicious and altogether a great experience,4
"This was our first time dining in public since February 2020 and it couldn‚Äôt have been better.  Our concerns about how closely we‚Äôd be seated to other people on the patio evaporated when we got to the restaurant.   There was so much room between us and the next table that we didn‚Äôt give it a thought for the rest of the night.   The wait staff were friendly and attentive.  And the food was delicious.  We had the crab fritters and tuna tartare, to start, and both were ‚Äòoh my god, this is so good‚Äô tasty.   My man had a steak (i forget what kind) that was tender and flavourful and I had the short rib Wellington which was ‚Ä¶ disappointingly dry.  It came with red wine jus but maybe there should have been more of it?  It felt like it was sticking to my teeth. But listen, it didn‚Äôt matter because everything else was terrific.  Tip:  Order the Old Fashioned; one of the best I‚Äôve ever tasted.",4
"As you can tell from the name, this is a high end steakhouse. Excellent food, service, great views - just a bit of sticker shock from the bill.",4
Amazing! A beautiful night. Celebrated my MCAT score and the team gave us a card. Very memorable,4
"Perfect. The food, the view, the service",4
Fantabulous!! From.start to end!!!,4
"Delicious food, excellent service, in a beautiful setting. Was the perfect night.",4
"Great service, good food. We booked the patio for our anniversary meal, but instead were put inside an enclosed structure with plastic windows, uncomfortable seating and no view. Sadly, the reason I booked BlueBlood at Casa Loma was for the experience, and I don't think we got to have that experience. The food was good, service was excellent, but I would encourage BlueBlood to remove any seating that's substandard - because people come to experience the patio and the view.",3
"We were celebrating my birthday and end of lockdown on a Saturday night. The setting was gorgeous, the service great and the ambiance was lovely but the steaks were awful. For the cost of $400 + tip for dinner for two, they should have been some of the best steaks we've ever had. They came out cold, over cooked, grey and chewy. I was only able to take 4 bites of it before pushing it aside. The leftovers were thrown away. The other items we ordered were good, but did not justify the cost of the bill. We were in a hurry to be somewhere else afterwards (dinner took 3+ hours) so we didn't say anything at the time, but I kindly let the restaurant know by email the next day and it was not acknowledged.",2
"Had a wonderful evening. The atmosphere was beautiful, service was phenomenal, and dinner was delicious. Will definitely return again and would recommend.",4
"Lovely setting and overall enjoyable experience, however the food quality  pricing left a lot to be desired. In that way it was quite overrated.
I‚Äôm not sure about recommending it based on that.
....but beautiful place to end a COVID lockdown!",2
"We had a lovely dinner last night. It was the first night that patios were open in a long time and it was like they had never closed! Great food, amazing service, spectacular views.. we will be back!",4
"Kosta our waitor and his busboy and waitress were absolutely outstanding, and we will be back just because of their service.",3
Very great food. A little bit pricey but definitely worth it. Highly recommend the wagyu!,4
The steak was over cooked and came out before the sides,1
"Came here to celebrate a birthday right before patios were closed and lockdown happened again. Upon arrival it was a bit confusing as we took an Uber here to avoid paying for parking and there was construction that they were doing at Casa Loma so we had to head in through this side door. We ordered Half a dozen oyster (3 from the west coast and 3 from the east coast) they were delicious and my partner who never tried them enjoyed it. We also tried there Alaska Crab Fritters, first few bites they were delicious but after a while I got sick of them you can totally skip it. I got the Canadian Prime steak which was a lot for me and my partner got a wagyu steak (dont remember the specific cuts as it was a while ago) He loved the wagyu and was impressed by how buttery it was. After our meal we got the Table-Side Baked Alaska for two (a bit much for two would definitely recommend for four) which was an amazing fire show as the server poured it over the dessert. They even gifted a cute Cast Loma Wine stopper and card that said happy birthday and a happy birthday chocolate piece for the dessert. When definitely come again once they open.",4
"My daughter took me to Blue Blood for Easter dinner. The food was amazing. The portions are a good size and we split the center cut steak and salmon. We did not have dessert( also good size portions) as we were full, however the server suggested fresh fruit which was perfect.
I am on an intolerance diet with many food restrictions and the server(Costa) and the restaurant were very accommodating.
The wait staff were constantly on the move filling your water, checking how your meal was, if you need anything else, etc.
The restaurant is in a large structured heated tent and was very comfortable with my winter coat off.
My daughter has been there 3 times now and every time she has had a great experience. I can honestly say I have never been to a restaurant with such great service.",4
"Amazing service, beautiful scenery, and outstanding food! Would recommend to all of my friends.",4
Our waiter was nothing short of amazing. The lobster bisque wasn‚Äôt as good as anticipated but everything else was truly amazing.,4
"Great meal in the middle of a once in a lifetime pandemic.  Despite the challenges of the pandemic, the team at blue blood did a fantastic job at preparing an impressive array of food reminding of the prepandemic meals I used to have inside.  The patio was spacious and warm, with patrons spaced apart. The Cesar salad was impressive and well made in front of us.  The steak was done as requested and the foisgras was amazing.   

Looking forward to post pandemic dining!",4
"Thanks for a lovely dinner, Bluebloods. The steak was phenomenal as was everything else. It‚Äôs sad to see the beautiful restaurant all dismantled, but that‚Äôs the virus‚Äô fault. They do a lovely luxury dinner even in current conditions, great special event meal.",4
"Everything was wonderful. Tables perfectly spaced and comfortable. Timing for drinks and food was quick but not rushed.  Our server Connor was excellent! He was very professional, well articulated and knowledgeable. Perfect first experience (covid has not affected the quality or standards but felt super safe and looked after). Will definitely be coming back",4
Everything was amazing with the waiter to the food!,4
Very nice experience very nice. The food and the drinks for a nice as well during that time was a little bit chilly so if they had more heaters to cover for their guest would be great Overall great experience that time,4
The $15 on site parking is a bit much given how much dinner costs,2
"Food and service was great!  Due to covid restrictions only outdoor patio available.  There are heaters but was not sitting next to it so it was cold for us.  If you are sitting on the patio, make sure to wear a sweater even if its 8c outside.  Views were great, food was delicious!  I would definitely go back for another celebration.",3
Blueblood is always our go to for any celebration. Love the food and the ambience,4
"THE best steakhouse in Toronto and the best patio! The heated tent is a God-send during our current situation. I highly recommend, really everything, but this time we had the seafood tower. Pairs well with Grand Cru. All cuts of meat are phenomenal. I recommend having a few apps, and splitting a cut to get the best possible. Also, the take away dirty martinis are amazing.",4
It was great first experience despite not being able to dine indoors,4
Can‚Äôt be to tough on them since it was just after the reopening of the patio.,2
"It was my first experience at Blueblood and at Casa Loma. Having just re-opened in 12 hours earlier from COVID lockdown, the experience and the food was excellent. The staff and service were welcoming from the moment we walked in, they were very friendly and professional. 

The ceaser salad was the best I've ever had and it was hand made in front you at your table for you and your guests to watch. I will definitely be coming again and this is one of my new favourite restaurants.",4
"Food and service was great, loved the original Cesar salad the best salad i ever had my husband and i enjoyed watching it made table side, our steaks were cooked to perfection no complaints here. We will be back soon!",4
Very helpful service. Waiter explained different dishes with clarity so that we made an informed decision when placing order. He was courteous and friendly. Excellent ambience.,4
"We celebrated my wife‚Äôs birthday there and it was SPECTACULAR! friend staff, nice music and the amazing food, specifically the fresh Caesar salad made our night one to be remembered!! We‚Äôll be back for sure!!",4
A very delicious anniversary dinner. We appreciated the service and the gift gesture. Thank you!,4
"I would highly recommend the restaurant reaching out to the customers about restaurant closing early because of weather issues. I called in advance to confirm but no one picked up the call. Once I reached there, I was told that the restaurant is being closed because of weather not being safe. Also, the restaurant hours are not clear, on the website it‚Äôs shows that the restaurant opens at 5:00pm, however my reservation was for 4:00pm and later 4:30pm.",0
"occasion wife's birthday
when you go to a restaurant like blue blood you know your going to pay extra for their food and service, and this is what you expect.
so why is it my waiter continued to watch me pour my own wine and water.
we had to ask three time if we were getting our bread.
the food came out cold.
it is not what i expected from this establishment.
it's to bad the chef who sat at another table with other parton's did no see fit to walk the room to see how everything was from other patrons(common in most high end restaurants) 
very disappointed you would think with these tough times (covid) they would want to go over and above to make sure customers return.",0
"My husband and I dined here for our 5th wedding anniversary and it was perfect.  The food, portion sizes, ambiance, service (our waiter Donaldo was so attentive, professional and was great at explaining the menu in detail) and the fact that the chef and Donaldo took my food restrictions so serious was very impressive.  We were very warm on the heated patio.  Plus, we were given a sweet keepsake and card for our anniversary at the end of dinner.  I would definitely recommend eating here.  It is well worth the money.",4
Service and food was excellent. Rib eye with bone in was perfect. Caesar salad was a delight. Was disappointed that you couldn‚Äôt order a bottle of wine for under 100 dollars.,3
"Best steak in town, hands down. My fiancee and I went to Blueblood for the first time last week and it definitely will not be our last. Great food, service and ambiance.",4
"we were going there for our anniversary looking for a quiet and romantic place to dine. At first our table was inside the huge outdoor dining area with almost all the other tables full and a very noisy environment which made us hardly hear each other talking. However, after requesting a quieter place, they moved our table to what we expected from the restaurant. 

The service is outstanding as well as the taste of every little item we were served. Cocktails are a bit overpriced but I still highly recommend them. We tried the Mojito and the berry smash with rum. The Atlantic salmon and 25 days striploin steak which were both amazing and fresh. 

In total, I fully recommend the place for any event.",4
"During Covid they really did a great job adjusting to the rules. 
I think overall it was a great experience.",3
David was amazing! Great experience. Great views all around,4
Superbe adresse,4
"We were very pleased with the whole experience. The patio was thoughtfully prepared, well spaced and ventilated, while still being warm. The food was excellent, and the portions were much larger than we expected. The Wagyu tasting menu was totally worth it. We will go again, for sure.",4
"To start off, BlueBlood Steakhouse is located inside of Casa Loma, making it a beautiful and romantic spot to have dinner. The service? Simply impeccable! Our server, Sergio, was truly fabulous! He helped us in choosing steaks, and was extremely knowledgeable, and hospitable! Instead of rushing us out, he insisted we stay to try our desert rather than ordering it to go. It was honestly a beautiful experience all thanks to Sergio! The food on the other hand was sub-par. We had to send the steaks back numerous times as we had ordered them medium-well, and upon eating them they were visibly medium, and quite red in the center. It wasn‚Äôt filled with flavour a slice I expected, and they just tasted very game-y, I wasn‚Äôt pleased... This however is more so an issue with the kitchen staff/cooks, not Sergio (our server. He really listened to our concerns and still (even with the food being not the best) made the experience beautiful for us! Sergio‚Äôs service+the castle vibes 6/5, food 2/5.",4
"This is my favourite place for celebrations and special occasions. The food is top quality, as is the service.",4
Fantastic meal and service.  Couldn't pick a better spot for a special night.,4
I have to say the best restaurant I have gone too but way overpriced like we just had the starters and we already had to pay 300 dollars. However it‚Äôs worth the money and it‚Äôs a very very very nice place,3
"Amazing food, and amazing staff. The staff were super attentive and very accommodating. From the moment that my date and I walked through the door, the hostess was energetic, and super nice, led us to our table. It was covered, and right by a heater, which was what we had requested when we made reservations. The wait staff were extremely attentive and accommodating as well; always changing the cutlery, double-checking  to see if our needs were met, etc. My date and I ordered the table side flambed crepes for dessert and the man doing it for our table was extremely kind and super engaging with conversation. The food itself was superb, we had ordered the octopus, a salad, the bone-in steak, and table side crepes. All of them were extremely tasty, especially the steak. Overall it was such a wonderful experience and the food was spectacular -- definitely worth a visit.",4
"Food and Service were outstanding.  A bit cold as we were outside and it was a chilly night, otherwise it was perfect.",4
"Incredible service, amazing food and beautifully done during Covid times. Would highly recommend, and definitely go again.",4
"Service was great, and the overall ambiance is perfect.",4
Dishes done very well with exceptional service. Outstanding variety as well.,4
"Despite it being outside on a relatively cold October evening, our group did not feel any shortage of dining experience (except maybe the view off of the terrace). Our waiter Donaldo was great, food was excellent and we were not rushed to leave!",4
"Outdoor patio was nice and warm. However, the food was good but had too much butter on it.",2
The food was a bit bland according to our tasting. The miso salmon lacked glazing and was not quite tasty as we had expected.,2
"Beyond disappointed. All of our sides came cold, no one came to ask if we wanted another round of drinks, my husband called in advance for them to prepare a birthday dessert for me and they didn‚Äôt do it. Then to add insult to injury we waited over 30 minutes for our bill. Not impressed at all.",0
Such an amazing experience. During a pandemic and not that‚Äôs it‚Äôs getting colder it‚Äôs so much harder to find a good restaurant that you can sit in and enjoy a delicious meal. The whole area is tented and is heated. The food was amazing and the service was amazing. I would definitely recommend coming here to celebrate a special occasion.,4
"Excellent experience! Attentive and personable service, outstanding food, great value! Patio is well setup and very comfortable, will go back again.",4
Food was really good and the service was amazing. Thank you Donaldo for the excellent service,4
"Everything was top notch.  From the freshly made Caesar Salad (that was made from scratch infront of your eyes) to the perfectly cooked AAA Sirloin Steak.  Blueblood was by far, the best overall restaurant I've eaten at",4
Overall good experience. Wife's steak was undercooked but did not want to send back for a small piece.  Mushroom side was a bit too salty.  Steak burger was delicious.,3
"Celebrated our wedding anniversary, the temperature outdoors was 9 degrees, however the outdoor patio was heated and cozy. Food and drinks were delicious, totally recommend the table side Caesar salad! Delicious!! Love the venue! 
Thank you for the little anniversary gift BlueBlood:)",4
Very romantic,4
I go to Blueblood fairly often for business dinners but on this occasion (during COVID) I was outside in a tent. The tent has no ambience and feels like we arrived at the end of a wedding...but the service and food was brilliant and my date loved it. It suddenly rained so I get it - tents work - but there is nothing like enjoying this incredible food indoors. The ambience inside is pure magic!,3
The staff were amazing. So polite and classy! It was my birthday and I didn‚Äôt even tell them they still brought out. Little casa loma wine topper gift and a card. It was overall an beautiful experience. They let us inside the first floor too to check out the castle and take some photos.,4
"Takes far too long to get a drink at this place. Each time I have gone here I‚Äôve had to wait at least 20 min for my first drink. This time we even had appys arrive before our first cocktail. This all being said, food is great, and I‚Äôll keep coming back.",4
"Donaldo was serving our table. He was very knowledge about his steaks and the rest of the menu. He explained the different cut of steaks that would satisfy our liking. We sat on the patio, it was a little cool but manageable. The staff tried everything to block off the draft, including placing the evergreens to do it! I appreciate it very much. Keep up the great work!",4
"Absolutely magical experience. Social distancing but with such a warm atmosphere, fabulous food, excellent service, and real care given.",4
"We went there for our first time, celebrating our anniversary. It was a great experience. Love the service. Great food and view outside.
Although we didnt dine inside (covid), outside was nice.
We want to come back and dine inside for sure.",4
Anniversary,4
They make the most of this historical location with exceptional food and service!,4
"Food was excellent 
Our service was beyond exceptional

Highly recommend for a special event",4
Very enjoyable evening in a majestic setting. Steaks were perfect. The food was excellent. Very attentive server. A great spot for a special occasion.,4
"Amazing food, amazing ambience great night",4
Amazing experience! One of my all around favourite restaurants!,4
"Amazing restaurant. Great food, service and atmosphere. I highly recommend it",4
"I was recommended to come here for a special meal by my CEO. We weren‚Äôt disappointed. The setting was beautiful, the interior was so old world and lovely. We had cocktails to start, oysters with fizz as a pre-starter and the sommelier really helped us choose a lovely Amarone for our meal. Even better she opened the wine early and let it breathe which was great as it got better as time went on. 

The octopus was amazing and the Wagyu carpaccio was melt in the mouth. We had delicious rib eye and striploin with fabulous garlic mash and asparagus. The peppercorn sauce was simply the best I‚Äôve ever tasted. 

Top that all off with banana crepes flamb√© at your table and as drambuie nightcap, we left very happy. 

We‚Äôve lived in Toronto for 20 months and were celebrating our final weekend before we fly home to Scotland. We‚Äôll certainly remember our meal here. Great food and fab people. Thank you.",4
"One of my favourite places in the city. Truly the top shelf for dining and experience. Bring the lady, go back in time, take it all in. Worth every penny.",4
"The food and the ambience was amazing.. Don made our night, he was very informative and helpful.",4
"This was my girst experience at Blueblood and it was exceptional! I greatly enjoyed my meal, best steak I have ever had.",4
"Very good food
Very nice ambiance
Welcoming and lovely staff",4
"I had a wonderful birthday meal tonight at Blueblood.
All of the staff looked after us so well.The manager Craig looked in on us from time to time to make sure everything was OK and he was fantastic.The food was amazing from the Caesar salad made at our table right up to the fabulous bone in ribeye we enjoyed.Our waiter really looked after us and was always seeing what we needed.All in all I had an incredible birthday and the baked Alaska birthday dessert literally topped the cake,
Can‚Äôt wait until our next meal at Blueblood.",4
Blue Blood was a good experience.  Our server Donaldo make it even better.  Service is top notch.,4
It was my boyfriend bday & the food was prepared for us that evening wasn‚Äôt to neither of our satisfactory. The salad was wilted for both of us and my steak was not enjoyable at all. I sent it back and that still didn‚Äôt do nothing. I took it to go & left it there cause I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to eat it again. Felt like I wasted my money. The mash potatoes was great but that was it. The service was just ok. I personally wouldn‚Äôt come back here again. (The keg in Brampton was better by far.),0
"From the time that we arrived we were greeted by a staff member walking us in, making sure we were shielding from the rain with his umbrella, opening the front doors for us to walking in...the front door attendants were able to accommodate us coming in 15 minutes early and have us seated instead of having to wait. The staff was very professional, attentive and cheerful. Our waitress did an amazing job with giving us detailed information about what we were ordering, making sure that everything was OK and that we were comfortable where we were seated and with our food. One of our favorite moments of the evening was when the waiter came out to make us our Caesar salad. We were so impressed by his wittiness and his charismatic nature. We will definitely be visiting again.",4
Always a good time at Bluebloods!,4
"The restaurant is literally in a castle, so the ambiance is amazing. The food and the service were wonderful.",4
"The service is amazing.. the setting (ambience) very beautiful.  The food is quite good.  There are very creative cocktail options and a decent wine list. 
Be prepared in that it will be an expensive bill.",4
"Such a sweet experience! Lovely staff and they even gave us a thoughtful gift for our anniversary! An Absolutely Magical experience! 

Thank you Blue Blood!",4
This place is worth every Dollar was impressed from the moment I stepped in from service food just overall experience was amazing.,4
We had Donaldo as our server and he was absolutely delightful! The service was outstanding and the food was fantastic!,4
"Ambiance was great. Their cleaning protocols were great and spacing between tables was good as well. Our server Sergio was great - courteous, helpful and always available when needed. Food quality was amazing. Would go back again.",4
"Speechless, 
Got the Alberta Porterhouse and it was the because steak I have ever had.",4
The meal was exceptional! And the staff was kind and accommodating!  We really enjoyed our time!  Definitely be back!,4
"Our experience was below expectations. I brought my best friend as a celebratory dinner but we did not enjoy ourselves as we thought we would. Our reservation was at 6pm and we didn't order until approx 7:15pm as we were forgotten about. We stopped a server and he said he'd get our server but no one came. When we finally ordered, I got an appetizer and entree, but both were brought out at the same time instead of my salad first as I was starving at this point. The food was not great, satisfactory if that which is unacceptable considering the prices. The ambiance was nice and the host that first greeted us when we walked in was amazing! Probably won't return though.",1
The seafood and steak were outstanding and ambiance very cozy and special...highly recommend,4
Loved the steak and oysters!,4
"We had Donaldo as our server , he was absolutely amazing! Full of energy and held a conversation great. who ever has the pleasure of having donaldo as there server is very lucky! 
Keep up the great work and don‚Äôt stop being awesome! Our experience was wonderful and one to remember! 
Well be back for sure‚ù§Ô∏è",4
"I don‚Äôt normally leave reviews unless A place really impresses me. Blue Bloods was recommended to me for a romantic steak restaurant. The ambiance was amazing and the staff were very courteous and helpful. The steak and appetizers were amazing and my girlfriend and I are already planning on going back again. I had the crab fritters for appetizers and the Rib Eye steak done Chicago style, medium well. It was amazing!!!!!! 

I would definitely recommend this place for so many reasons. Well worth a try if you‚Äôve ever been there!!",4
"Went for my daughters birthday dinner. Location is great, however, paid parking seems excessive, especially as it‚Äôs on their property. 
Service is A1. Everyone from the greeting at the gate to seating at our table, all servers were excellent. Friendly, fast and attentive. 

Food was delicious-but everything is a la carte, so it will add up quickly. 

In honesty, the location is beautiful, and the service is great, the food is good. But be prepared to spend.",3
Wedding anniversary,4
The food was extremely delicious. The ambiance is amazing. Service is good. It‚Äôs worth the price.,4
"The food, as always, was excellent! Lindsay was waiting on our table and she was fabulous and top notch service. Keep it up!",4
First visit and there will definitely be more visits to come.  We felt at home there with all your staff!  Connor was our server and he was FANTASTIC!!  See you soon!!,4
"Awful service and food, was not at all what we expected.  Very unhappy, sent an email to the restaurant.",1
service was friendly and informative however the overall time waiting for food was long.,4
"I LOVED IT..  WE WERE ON THE PATIO AND WE HAD THE PERFECT VIEW OF THE CITY.  FOOD WAS GREAT. SERVICE A BIT ROUGH IN THE BEGINNING BUT WAS FANATASTIC AT THE END. 

I RECCOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR A COOL VIBE AWAY FROM THE DOWNTOWN CORE",4
"Everything was incredible, from the food to the service! Wish I could remember the servers name but more than incredible all around service
Will return again for sure",4
"Wonderful night out! Very attentive and accommodating staff, fantastic food and beautiful ambiance! Highly recommend!",4
"The setting is superb. The food was fabulous. The Caesar salad was amazing and is prepared at your table. 
We chose to eat early as there would be less people. Which didn‚Äôt disappoint. 
We had the salmon with asparagus. Cooked perfectly.
The desserts where fabulous. 
Only down side was to be charged $8 for a bottle of flat water and the coffee needs a total upgrade to a decent roast. 
We received a lovely keepsake for our anniversary.
A lovely dinner with beautiful surroundings.",4
"Had a fantastic dinner at BlueBlood! The service was fantastic, the food was incredible, and the views were beautiful.",4
"the tasting menu of wagyu was so salty, I can‚Äôt even believe that I spend 250 dollars for this ridiculous salty beef on my 5th anniversary. Also we ate our dinner surrounded by a dreadful clamor kind of noise the whole time because we were told that the casa loma is testing their horror festival for the next day. I was so disappointed so I even skip my dessert because the only thing I want to do at that moment is to leave as soon as I can. The waiter only showed twice during the whole dinner to offer us the menu and gave us the bill. I asked several times for the water. I was just so disappointed that me and my husband drove 1 Hr and spend 500 dollars on our 5th anniversary for theses? I would not recommend this place to anyone. Way too expensive for  food or service or even the ambiance. This is the worst anniversary dinner I even had.",2
Wonderful dining experience from the time we stepped through the iron gates.  Attentive staff. Best Chilean sea bass and grilled octopus my husband has ever had. Special Thanks  to Kostas.   We will definitely return and would not hesitate in recommending BlueBlood Steakhouse.,4
Great experience. Love the setting as its in side a castle.,4
Loved our entire experience. It was a lovely place to celebrate a birthday. Steak was cooked to perfection and staff was incredible,4
We were seated much closer to other guests than we have been at other restaurants when seated indoors during COVID. The food was all competently prepared but nothing was spectacular.,3
"Oh wowwwww.....Where do i begin! Besides it's amazing picturesque landscape, this magnificent Historical landmark is truly a gem. The restaurant has the absolute best cuisine. The amazing team/staff here is a tremendous example of our city's people. So warm, courteous and absolutely professional. DAVID our top server was absolutely phenomenal!!!!! Wow what a star üåü and team member COSTA was right on top of thingsüëåüèΩüíé We felt so welcomed and taken care of‚ù§ We will definitely be back! Thanks team for making our Birthday dinner 1 to remember.",4
Beautiful patio. Amazing good. Great service. Oh yeah - it‚Äôs in a castle!,4
The food and service was amazing. We loved everything - the porterhouse was one of the best steaks I‚Äôve ever had. The drinks are also very good. The ambiance is perfect for a date night or for a group. Would recommend to anyone going to Toronto,4
They tried to serve our meal before we had salad.  Then again while we were still eating our salad.  When we finally got the meal (3rd time) the Scallops and risotto was cold and the risotto wasnt even cooked.  Crunchy like dry rice.,1
"The service was poor (more than 25 minutes for drinks; dirty table not wiped down between courses; no wine was offered for mains and the server was wearing his mask improperly and had his nose sticking out of the mask - I hope he doesn‚Äôt have COVID-19). 

The food was okay but not fantastic (tuna tartar was over mixed and overly dressed and salty; steaks came out not hot). You‚Äôd expect a restaurant to cook better than you do at home. But this isn‚Äôt the case for our Bluebloods meal. 

There was no music playing and we were seated close to an exhaust pipe which was noisy. 

For $500 for two people you expect better. Shameful experience. 1st and last time here.",1
Food was delicious. Great ambiance. Spectacular place and service.,4
"My family had a wonderful experience celebrating our son‚Äôs big day.  We had a lovely table on the patio with a stunning view of the castle grounds set to the background of the CN tower.  Our server, Trevor was on point for every component of service during the meal.  The sommelier James provided and wonderful recommendation for our wine (I had 3 glasses!) and went over and above to make my son a mock tail to celebrate his making the baseball team.
This was all before our meal hit the table at which point, my sons jaw hit the floor when our steak (44 Oz Tomahawk!) hit the table.  The presentation of all of the dishes is worthy of the Majestical setting.
I would come back and enjoy the level of decadence and fine dining anytime,

Thanks to Chef Scot and the whole staff.  My son is still smiling!",4
Our server Donaldo was terrific!,4
"This is my Second time to Blue Blood and it was as fantastic as the first.  This time I took my partner for dinner on our 5th year anniversary.  He absolutely loved it and the ambiance was just delightful.  
Ian was our server and we couldn't have been happier with him.  He was a great server as well as all the supporting staff including bussers, tableside caesar service along with the sommelier that helped us pick our bottle with our dinner.  
Would definitely come back and will spread the word.",4
"So to start off, you come to BlueBloods for the aesthetic of the castle, it is absolutely gorgeous and dreamy. I adored every decoration and the chandeliers made you feel like pure royalty. It however was just so ridiculously sad to see people show up in jeans...that was just trashy and no Chanel bag would make up for it. 

My only complaint in terms of service was there was a gentleman at the front where you would get dropped off who would direct you to the front door, he was extremely rude and just ignored almost everyone walking through. He watched a woman trip and did nothing to help her regain her bearings. 

The food was delicious albeit the steak was small and next time if I come and order steak I‚Äôm bringing a scale.",3
Went for my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday and had a great night. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the food was great. Overall had a fantastic experience and would definitely go again,4
"My family dined in last night for our anniversary and we are very pleased with the service( Luca, was our server he was detailed and helpful. Actually everyone was great at their job), the ambience was beautiful and the food was by far the excellent steak we had. 

Thank you so much for the wonderful experience. For sure we will be seeing you soon.",4
The steak was very fatty and chewy and I only had a few pieces that were adequate at best.,2
"absolutely amazing. service was incredibly attentive and kind, food was beyond expectations. will be returning :)",4
We celebrated my husband‚Äôs birthday at BlueBlood and we had a wonderful experience. Our server was amazing and since we arrived with a 3 month old baby.. they were very accommodating.,4
It was amazing. Like no other in the city.,4
"The steak was delicious, though it was the most expensive I've ever had. The proximity to neighbouring table was a bit surprisingly close.

At times our server would be so busy he would forget about us for very long stretches.

But overall, a very cool space.",3
"Honestly,  the best food and view I‚Äôve had in the country.",4
"It was my first time there and by far my favourite restaurant in Toronto. I would definetely love to go again. We had the best table close to the edge of the balcony looking at the Toronto skyline. The food, the lights, the service was absolutely perfect. The castle looks beautiful both during the day and at night. I would recommend it to anyone that is visiting Toronto.",4
"foie gras and Caesar Salad the best I have ever eaten!
The mains  - seabass and osso bucco good. I suspect because their beef is the main event that that would probably be excellent. We didn't feel in the mood to pay so much for it though.",3
The best steak that I ever had! Great service! Amazing ambiance!,4
"The overall experience was not great.
Food was ok.  Asked for Medium rare and the steak came out Medium.
Waitress lack knowledge on Food.  Cannot properly explain ""Wet Aged"" vs ""Dry Aged"". Totally over-priced for the quality of the food.
In addition, the room was not packed but we were put in a corner with really uncomfortable chairs (chairs different from other tables).  They did a great job making us feel like we do not belong there.  We were not pleased at all.",1
This is our second time at BlueBlood and once again it did not disappoint! The food is outstanding highly recommend the table side Cesar salad you‚Äôll be dreaming about  it for days and our server was AMAZING! He even took  us around out back and showed us the best spot to see the city!,4
Engagement,3
Was great food and service !!,4
"The service was impeccable. Paul and Luca went above and beyond to accommodate us. The food is great, and the ambience is wonderful. Would highly recommend for a special night out.",4
"First time going to Casa Loma and definitely will not be my last.

I was running late for my reservation and with no issue at all they pushed the time for me. 

Ian was my server and he was perfect. Genuine and sweet souled.

The food was to absolute die for. Got a rib eye steak, bone in... sooo flavorful

Would highly recommend for a ""feel extra good"" night out.. very classy and posh!",4
Too chilly.,4
"The service was very good. Very pricy, but the food was very good. Had veal and my partner had ribs Wellington. Large portions, not disappointed. 

Deffinatly not a regular thing if your on a budget. Maybe once a year for a special occasions.",4
Fantastic. Beautiful place. The food was simply delicious. Worth every dime.,4
Excellent dining experience,4
What a fantastic backdrop for dinner!  Really outstanding scenery in an iconic location.  The food was amazing!  The Sommelier was fantastic - one of the best that I have ever met (and they were spot-on with their recommendation).  The Service was OK.  The pace of the courses and the delivery of auxiliary items (e.g. drinks and wine) was off but I'm giving them a pass due to COVID.  I'm sure it is very difficult to run a restaurant with all of the current restrictions in place.  I would highly recommend and I will definitely give them a 2nd chance!  It's really an outstanding place to go for an unforgettable meal!!,3
"Although our servers were very friendly , the service was very poor. Us constantly asking to place an order, for more drinks, for our bill etc. The food was quite a disappointment as well. We had asked in advance for a baked Alaska as it was a birthday celebration, we waited and waited not wanting to ruin the surprise. Finally the birthday guest asked for the bill and the staff didn‚Äôt bother to bring it or apologize for the delay. Very disappointing, we will not be back.",0
Service wasn‚Äôt great our waitress had is on a pay no mind list.,2
"Food was pretty good, my wife did not like what she ordered though. Personally we both felt service was slow (even to get our bill). 

Environment was amazing",3
"Really nicely decorated place with a beautiful park outside and good service, but the food wasn‚Äôt worth the money. We ordered the seafood tower. Nothing special in taste as well as the portions are waaaayy too small, it wasn‚Äôt anything close to the tower at all. I am a person who can‚Äôt eat much in general and get full really fast, but I left this place being very much hungry!",1
Ronaldo was our server and he was absolutely incredible. Went above and beyond to explain the menu perfectly and suggest us proper items and portions. Just honestly made the night with his awesome personality.,3
"Super fine dining, the Alaska crab fritters were delicious. Capresse salad was unique but good. I got the scallops and I was not a fan. Boyfriend got the lobster Mac and cheese and it was moderate.. the noodles were too hard and not saucy enough, quite dry.",2
DONALDO WAS THE MOST AMAZING SERVER IVE EVER HAD AND THE FOOD WAS INCREDIBLE. 10/10 CANT WAIT TO GO BACK.,4
The waiter was amazing!!!!!!!,4
"BlueBlood has a Beautiful dining room and Impeccable service.  Our waiter ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù Conner was charming, polite and well spoken.  The food was fantastic.  Beautiful place, i would recommend it most definitely!!",4
Food was better than expected and the baked Alaska was a fun show.  Service wasn't what I would expect for a high end steak restaurant.  Would recommend if you want a crowd.  The grounds are beautiful and views are great.,2
Server was great. We sat in the bar area on the bench along the window. Food was yummy. Server was very knowledgeable about the menu and helped us make the right choice for what we were looking for. Great experience and felt safe the whole time.,4
"Overall we had an amazing experience.

I had the bone-in 18 oz steak from Wichita Kansas. This steak is USDA graded and one of the best things I have ever eaten. For $100, its genuinely a fantastic price for such a high-quality piece of meat. Tones of fatty flavour and it was seared to perfefction. Amazing steak.

My girlfriend on the other hand got the Barrel Cut Filet from Wheeler county Nebraska, 8 oz. We both ordered our steaks medium rare, mine was perfect, hers on the other hand was on the rare side. Still tons of great flavour though. 

The sides were good, the steak obviously stole the show though. Sizes of the sides are to share which is nice. 

For dessert we got the profiterole; AMAZING. Simply put. 

Most importantly, our waiter Donaldo, made the evening truly special. Big thanks to him. He was a genuinely caring and professional person. 

Would come back, highly recommend for something different in Toronto; the patio was beautiful!!!!",4
Great experience! You'll have lasting memories!!!!,4
"Proposed to my girlfriend, now my fianc√© in the romantic dining room. With physical distancing in place it was especially private with a nice ambiance. Food was spectacular with unique presentations. The tenderloin was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the Gorgonzola gnocchi was my fav. Will be coming back again for sure.",4
"Excelente Food, good service, but we can‚Äôt select our table",4
"We sat on the terrace. Beautiful view. We were out there by ourselves so it was weird but nice. We were celebrating 26 years of marriage. NOTHING special was done for us. A ridiculous card? A waiter telling us you‚Äôre outta signature corks but we can have TWO of them next time we come back? A waiter who asks is everything ok and when you tell him that you really enjoy the oil that came with the bread, he tells you for 5 minutes that he dislikes it and avocado and grape seed oils are his preferences? You order onion rings and he tells you that you didn‚Äôt? 

Let‚Äôs just say, the gratuity was still too much for this evening and perhaps when we were sitting outside wrapped in sweaters and scarves, someone would offer us a table inside? 

Lucas..take a course on how to make your customers enjoy themselves. Laugh...I did notice the other couple celebrating their anniversary having a GREAT time with their server!",0
"We have been wanting to come to BlueBlood for a long time as we have only ever heard good things so I booked for my partners birthday. From the moment we arrived we received such a friendly welcome from all the staff. We sat outside on the patio and had gorgeous views of the city. Our waiter Donaldo was so lovely and really attentive. The food was amazing, completely met and exceeded our expectations. The portions were generous, we ended up taking leftovers home. The truffle potato gratin is a must, I could have had that as my main course it was so yummy. Will definitely be back.",4
Great service and staff. Food was on point the scallop risotto and lobster bisque/mac&cheese were perfectly made and tasted amazing. Location and views are amazing. Staff were professional and very accommodating and made the night just perfect. Look forward to try their other new restaurant next week!,4
"the medium rare rib eye from kansas was excellent. but i didn‚Äôt quite enjoy the taste of kennebec fries. asparagus was great and so was grilled octopus. the red wine i got was great as well. 

i liked the service but hoped it was a little fast because i missed my massage session that night.",3
"The evening was lovely. Only downside was the speed of the service and attention to detail of the server - but we put it down to this weird new world we are all adjusting to. The food and setting were outstanding.  I brought a warm wrap which was wise as we were not seated close to any of the few patio heaters. But the tables were well spaced, the view was breathtaking when the sun set and we loved the whole experience. It‚Äôs getting cool but it was without a doubt a great spot to celebrate a special occasion",3
The seating fell like it was just place there for extra seating,1
"I cannot say enough good things about BlueBlood Steakhouse. It was an absolutely fantastic meal and by far the best steak I have ever had in my life. Everything we ordered had immaculate presentation and tasted even better! 

We received outstanding service from everyone who engaged with us. We learned about wine from the Sommelier and she helped us select the best one to pair with our meal.

We dined for my boyfriends birthday and they gifted him with a BlueBlood cork. 

Overall an amazing experience and we will definitely be back. Thank you for the superb hospitality!",4
Great experience from beginning to end. Our server was absolutely amazing!,4
Overall- greast experience: food was OK and service could've been better. We were celebrating special occasions and would've hoped the restaurant would've acknowledged with a small gesture.,2
"We sat outdoors and that may have affected the food.  I found that the food was cool. The crab fritters were excellent as was the Caesar salad, Tomahawk steak and baked Alaska.  The field mushrooms were a bit salty.  Overall, a very pleasant experience.",2
All good! Food was great! Large portions;),3
Service bit slow but friendly. Lobster bisque was worst ever. steak made it to table barely warm. best part of meals were mashed potatoes and duck-fat fries. Better steak experience at the KEG for fraction of the price.  Place is a tourist trap. Nice place to visit but not to eat.  Not coming back. Food overrated and way overpriced.,1
"Nothing,steak was under cooked and bad, service was not professional and like 2 stars restaurant... over priced",0
We love donaldo!,4
It was the perfect night.  There isn't one thing I can say to improve on.  Thank you to the staff at BlueBlood.,4
"Love the experience! The view,  the ambiance was beautiful! The weather perfect for outdoor dining.  The only downfall was the table side Caesar salad, the dressing was delicious but the romaine lettuce was a little brown on the edges.  The salad should have been a bit more fresh. The rest of our meal was delicious. The steak was cooked to perfection. The garlic mashed delicious as well as the asparagus. The dessert was so yummy!",3
Service was amazing! Food was wonderful and cooked to perfection. Ambience and view was spectacular. Will definitely go again!,4
"Everything was great. Oysters,steak, drinks. Don‚Äôt get the osso buco.",4
"Absolutely beautiful! Perfect way to celebrate a birthday. Everyone is so friendly, food was delicious and you can‚Äôt beat the view.",4
"Food was terrible.
Service was non-existent.
Dining room was boiling hot so we were sweating through our meal.",0
"Ambiance was great but unfortunately it stopped there.  It was one disappointment after another.  When I called to reserve for my husband's birthday I asked for a table that overlooked the CN tower. The lady that took my reservation said that while she couldn't reserve a specific table, she would write down recommendations on my reservation. Unfortunately I didn't get what I wanred.  There was a table vacant that had the perfect view but when I asked to move, I was told that that table was reserved for a friend of the owners. Not nice! I was told it was first come first serve for a table.  We loved our waiter... He was very attentive although he did forget to put in our order for the tableside Caesar salad. We had to remind him and he was very apologetic. I will say the salad was delicious. Our steaks came but both of them were over cooked which was very disappointing.  More apologies again. They did offer to bring us another steak but by then it close to 10 oclock and we have had enough. The manager came over, was very nice and apologized once again. He offered us a free desert which we declined and gave us a small discount off of the bill. He also gave us a gift card for a future visit which we will never use.  There are many steakhouses in the city and this one was very disappointing. Take your money and go elsewhere.",2
Excellent as usual,4
Loved everything!,4
"We took our parents there for their anniversary and had a wonderful time. Our waiter, Donaldo, provided us with excellent service and the food came to us in a timely manner. The food was DELICIOUS! Some of us ordered steaks and some the lobster thermidor, and all were fantastic. The crab fritters were also excellent. The sommelier (I think his name might have been James) was also very helpful! All in all a great time was had and we look forward to returning again!",4
"We Celebrated our 25th Wedding Anniversary and the night was perfect! Our table, all of the staff, and our meal were exceptional. BlueBlood Steakhouse is an unforgettable dining experience. A classy, elegant, and memorable celebration! 
Thank you! 
April and Gordon Fraser",4
"I ordered Wagyu Rib Eye and I got pretty much pure fat. I know for a fact even though marbling makes Wagyu very fatty it doesn‚Äôt turn it into just fat.  Sides sweet potato fries and mash potatoes were perfectly average. Jumbo Prawn cocktail was good. It was my 1st wedding anniversary and I did not want to make a scene, but afterwards  when I thought about it 438 dollars for two people you‚Äôd think you‚Äôd get decent food. Ambiance of the restaurant was good. Our server was very professional and recommended great wine.",2
Had a lot of expectations from this fine dining steakhouse. Our bill came to $350 before tip and we felt like we get better value at the Keg. Both steaks were over cooked and when we asked the server she said that‚Äôs the way they cook it. So I responded by saying if I wanted a medium rare steak I should order rare? She said yes. I find that to be deceiving. Not to mention steak was extremely salty. Will not be returning.,1
Nice staff,4
"It was an amazing experience. The service it was excellent I felt very comfortable to order my individual place and appetizer as my husband and I we did and at the same time we have the freedom to order to share our plates. The service was excellent and it really made me impressed. Price well it is what you get dinning at Casa Loma. We order the Beef Tartare it for my taste will need some more spicy but delicious anyway. The Wagyu capaccio really impressed us I would order 5 more lol. Our main course was the beef wellington what was amazing but I will have the dough a little more toasted/God. 

I would recommend to other friends and go back to try something different.",4
Food was fantastic. The property is gorgeous. The service was very good and gave great recommendation.,3
"I'll never get tired of going there: outstanding food, outstanding service, outstanding EVERYTHING.",4
"Such an amazing experience. Perfect way to celebrate a milestone birthday. Everyone was extremely friendly, helpful and accommodating.
Food was delicious!",4
Had a private tour of the Castle from Oliver....awesome end to the evening!,4
"Despite the fact that we were the only visibly minorities that were there, and was seated at the back, the venue is beautiful and the food was superb.",2
"My boyfriend an I LOVED dining here, not only was the food delicious but the view and atmosphere made it a night to remember. We will definitely be coming back in the future!",4
Excellent ambiance and service ...food speaks for itself !!,4
"We went here for my moms birthday and we had a really great time. Food was amazing, ur server was funny and polite. Overall our experience was amazing.",4
Steak was not the best.  Steak was not hot when it first came out.,2
Went for anniversary dinner.  It patio is very pretty with amazing views.  The food and service were top notch.  Overall great experience!,4
"Casa Loma is beautifully restored, and a perfect setting for a quiet and romantic dinner. The service here is exceptional. The Somm is young but knowledgeable, and was spot on with every wine and cocktail recommendation. Every dish was prepared well and the quality is second to none. Highly recommended for foodies and wine snobs!",4
"Disappointing. After hearing rave reviews from several friends, Blue Blood delivered good (not great) entrees with very poor service.   I‚Äôve had better service at a diner. 

We skipped the apps because we ordered a lot of food - 44oz Tomahawk + 2X lobster tails + jumbo shrimp + scallops + mashed potatoes, broccolini and sweet potato fries for four of us. 

90 minutes after ordering, our dinner finally arrived. 

Our Waiter did not have the courtesy to inform us about any delays in the kitchen with our order but after about 70 minutes I finally enquired.   The Waiter sent someone to tell us that the Tomahawk takes a long time to cook.  Really!?!? I‚Äôd rather they were just honest with us. 

The Waiter removed my glass of beer from the table before I finished drinking it. Rookie mistake.  

Maybe we just hit a bad night with a Waiter that failed to check on our order with the kitchen and he certainly failed to communicate with us on the status of our dinner.  

The venue, ambience and menu are exceptional.  Too bad the service ruined it for me and my family. 

We won‚Äôt be going back and will share our unfortunate experience with anyone thinking of going out to dinner in Toronto.",2
"we visited for our first anniversary and sat outside with the perfect view of the CN tower! Our server was super friendly and even gifted us with a card and wine stopper to help
celebrate our big day! The short rib wellington was AH-MAZING",4
Anniversary,4
"Food was top notch, even left overs were impressively good. Signature cocktails were a great start to the night",4
"Beautiful terrace, amazing service and exceptional food!",4
"We have been to this restaurant a few times. However, this time service was not good. They had a humid interior as all doors were open. I understand it could be for pandemic time but there are other restaurants that are open and they have a perfect air conditioning and I don‚Äôt think it is because of city mandate as it should apply to all places across the city.
Server was slow and some of them were not knowledgeable about food ingredients. When asked a question it took sometime for him to come back and also lots of time our drinks were empty and not filled in a reasonable time. When you pay over $300 per person in a restaurant you expect much better service.",3
Great food! The staff was so kind and helpful. Definitely an experience for a special occasion.,4
"Best restaurant in Toronto hands down. 
Would highly recommend",4
"Service was very good overall, but the taste of food we ordered fell a bit short of expectation compared to other steakhouses. The sun was right towards to table we sat so it was too hot sometimes, wish they could consider the timing of the booking when doing table selection if possible. It was good dining experience overall.",2
"BlueBlood has done an amazing job on their patio, it is absolutely beautiful. Service was great, especially our sommelier Tess. It is really inspiring to see what they have created out of a challenging situation, and this patio set up should be a main stay, even past this pandemic. Wagyu steak was unreal.",4
Excellent. We will be back.,4
"Seafood tower + wagyu burger for the wiiiiiin 
Service is great, view amazing",4
100$ steak over cooked and underwhelming,1
"It was good experience over all, lucky we got a nice patio table",4
"We had such a great experience at Blu Bloods. From the table side caesar to the table side baked alaska, everything was so amazing.",4
"Our recent experience was nothing less than amazing! Our seat was private, service was impeccable and of course the steak and sides were delicious. We‚Äôll definitely be back!",4
"Great food, great experience. Will be back!",4
"Service was excellent, accommodating and professional.",4
Had a great experience. Unfortunately cannot remember our servers name but she was wonderful and very helpful. All the food with the exception of the fries was 10/10. Will absolutely be coming back.,4
"Celebrating my daughters 18th birthday with 2 of her closest friends.     They Enjoyed the experience  immensely.   Cesar  salad was made fresh at the table with chosen fresh ingredients.  BlueBlood Salad was amazing.   

Staff were spectacular, keeping patrons both safe through continued cleaning and good serving practices along with continued great service. 

Would have been nice to be able to walk through the castle and/or view the patio and grounds but due to CIVID restrictions were in place.",4
The food and service was excellent! Our server Donaldo was exceptional!,4
Excellent food and personalized service - Well done! Will be back ...,4
"We were celebrating our anniversary there, my fianc√© proposed to me a year ago at Casa Lomas Blueblood Steakhouse and we were happy to be back. Weve been multiple times but It was our first time sitting on the Terrace and it was beautiful. The food is amazing as always, and the ambience is perfect. Our server was so friendly and always making sure we were doing well with food and drinks. We are 100% coming back every year!",4
Too many bees and flies flying on my food when dining outside. I had 3 bees swarming my table often at the same time. The environment outside was nice with the clear tents to view the castle and CN tower.,1
"Service was great üëç.  The food wasn't as expected
 Considering the price for the food I expected better
 The next day I had the worst heart burn.
Beautiful property but the food wasn't as good as I thought it would be",2
Our waiter was exceptional and the food was amazing. Great night!!,4
"Amazing service and food! The waiters really take care of their guests, we didn‚Äôt even have to call our waiter over once, he was always one step ahead.",4
"We were at BlueBlood Steakhouse to celebrate our two-year wedding anniversary. From the moment we stepped in, the host and staff were welcoming, friendly, and accommodating (we were half an hour early for our reservation). We were seated at a table on the terrace under the tent with great views of the city. The service was wonderful from every single person that came to our table, and the food was to die for. We were very well taken care of! At the end of our meal, our server presented us with a sweet handwritten card, and keepsake wine stopper (featuring Casa Loma) as a celebratory gift for our wedding anniversary. Truly an unbelievably amazing experience!",4
"Amazing food, amazing atmosphere amazing service. Highly recommended!",4
"Great for special occasions, patio dining a must in summer",3
Very mediocre,2
"The ambience, the food  and service was excellent. A wonderful finale to receive a BlueBlood souvenir when celebrating an occasion.",4
"Worst table on the patio.
Service was slow.
One steak arrived cold.

Staff made an effort to rectify the situation but the experience was already poor.

For the cost of a dinner at the restaurant, the experience should be top tier from start to finish.",1
Amazing views!,4
If you love steak you cannot go wrong with the Wagyu sampler.  smokey old fashions were really exceptional.  oysters were a great value!  Table side baked Alaska is the standout desert here!  don't miss out,4
Never trust David's recommendation and go with your own choice.,2
Really great food and a fantastic view for an occasion,4
You wait too much time to get a simple glass of wine or bottle of soft drink. More than 15 minutes. It‚Äôs embarrassing.,1
Great new outdoor seating section. Very high end food and service,4
"Dinner was amazing! I asked for a beautiful table and they sat us at a table to which you could get a great picture background for both of us. The waiter was kind and attentive, helped me chose the perfect filet, recommended drinks and we had a wonderful table side baked Alaska! Highly recommend to anyone wishing to pamper themselves for a night!",4
"It was so lovely to celebrate my birthday with my family on Toronto‚Äôs most beautiful outdoor patio. We went on a Wednesday evening and the service was excellent. I have been on busier evenings and the service can be much slower especially with larger groups. We shared the seafood tower, blue cheese salad and a fabulous ribeye. The coconut cream pie is fantastic - we shared 1 piece for the 4 of us and it was the perfect amount. They have a good selection of wines, but be prepared to pay a premium. Highly recommend for a special occasion!",4
Absolutely AMAZING ! The food is exceptional..The best steak I‚Äôve ever had. Everything we tried was phenomenal. Absolutely beautiful ambience and surroundings. Service was wonderful (thank you Connor). Can‚Äôt wait to go back. Wish I could give more than 5 stars. Absolutely worth every penny.,4
"Delicious food, great service! Would dine there again",4
Fantastic!!,4
"Decided to go to celebrate our 19th wedding anniversary and we couldn‚Äôt have been more happy. The food is amazing and worth every penny. The service - easy, friendly, professional and welcoming. 
The set up for social distancing doesn‚Äôt make you feel uncomfortable, it‚Äôs cozy and appropriate. 
I will say that with the amazing weather we are having, sitting inside was a bit hard because of a lack of good air flow - we will be back and try the patio very soon. 
Other than that, we can‚Äôt wait to go back. 
As a pescatarian, I found their Turf menu is better than some seafood establishments. 
The table side Cesar salad is the best in town. I am still dreaming about it.",4
We got there early and were seated immediately. Our waiter was excellent as well as the rest of the wait staff. He was attentive and even took us down to the garden to take some pictures for us. Our meals were excellent. We were not rushed and enjoyed the perfect weather.,4
Best restaurant ever !,4
Best view of the city and the wine list is on point.  Can not wait to return and have more Tarlant Rose Champagne!,4
"Everything was great. The food, wine collection and services were all great.thanks",4
Food average. Overpriced. Small portions. Don‚Äôt get your moneys worth for the overall taste and quality. Wouldn‚Äôt rush back.,2
"Weak service and mediocre food. Only thing memorable was the bill. 
Would highly suggest a pass, so many better options that provide much better value. 
Voiced all my concerns in person with manager who offered us a free drink which we declined. .......",1
Awesome!!!,4
"Great food and even better ambiance - nothing else really like it
Service was lacking; no where near level at Jacobs, which was disappointing.
However, the $15 parking fee was the most surprising element of the night
If you're there to roam the grounds and grab a drink, I see this being justified. But not waiving on the charge after spending $500 on a bit of meat and what would be a $40 bottle of wine at the LCBO, really surprising.

I will likely return, just not anytime soon.",3
The view was amazing but I felt extremely rushed because the waiters  were asking to remove our plates every minute even if we weren‚Äôt finished eating our food so that really took away from the experience. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt actually enjoy myself.,2
"We felt like they really took care of us. I marked down on here that it was our anniversary and they gave us a commemorative cork and a card. It made the night more special. 

I also have a few allergies and get nervous about discussing it with restaurants as sometimes, waiters freak out and it scares me and makes me more conscious about eating. However, the manager very calmly thanked me like it was no big deal and made sure I knew I had nothing to worry about. Her composure in dealing with my allergies made me feel more calm. 

Thank you for a wonderful evening! Obviously the food was amazing, but for me, what made this restaurant a new favorite was the great service! We will definitely be coming back.",4
Horrible experience. Please reach out if you want further explanation.,0
Incredible!,4
"Had a wonderful experience at Blueblood, our waiter was amazing and so good to us throughout the night. The service from all staff was exquisite  from the moment we walked into the door ! The food was good but not the best I‚Äôve ever had flavour wise. The steak was cooked perfectly and so was my salmon but flavour wise it was a little underwhelming for me. The dessert was amazing ! It‚Äôs a bit expensive but it‚Äôs expected given the location and quality of food",3
Great service and beautiful ambiance!!,4
"We visited the blueblood for our anniversary dinner.  All of the experience at the restaurant was like a dream; a fantastic place, great foods, professional services and a surprise gift!!!
Make sure to stay longer night to see a true beauty of the castle.",4
Amazing experience. So nice to have a high end restaurant in mid town.,4
Our waiter Trevor was amazing. The food was amazing . Everything was amazing . No complaints.,4
Great for special occasions.,4
Excellent place to go outside patio fantastic feels like Europe,4
"The place is beautiful, the hosts were very accommodating. Server was kind but overall we were neglected at times and service wasn‚Äôt consistent. Not sure if this was due to the amount of people present but it felt a bit rushed, or food didn‚Äôt even come out at the same time. The food was amazing with the exception of the cognac lobster bisque which was a 0/10. But the steak is amazing and very filling! Ambiance is 10/10.",2
"The overall vibe is very nice and romantic. The portions of the food was actually very good. The service was amazing, all the employees were all very friendly and welcoming. My only complaint was that my food took quite a while to come but other than that a great dining experience, would definitely go there again",3
The food was average. Not worth the penny.,2
We reserved the seat for 7:45pm but we got the seat at 9 the food is so so as well won‚Äôt come again,1
"This was meant to be a special occasion a 10 year anniversary in which we called to advise on the reservation. It started with horrible service and remained that way for the length of our reservations. We were 6 guests we waited 2 hours For our table side salad our steaks when they finally reached the table were cold and had to be sent back... each wine refill took well over 25 min to reach the table and the bill was a fiasco in itself. Given we were 6 people 3 couples prior to anyone arriving I had specifically asked the server to keep us all on separate bills he reconfirmed all the couples and wrote what looked like our orders separate in his book... when it came time to the bill no ones cheque was accurate when I tried to help he was rude and snapped the bill from My hand we told the manager about our experience and although he did try to help he wasn‚Äôt the most pleasant. My friend was so upset with the service we got and wrote an email detailing our experience and still a week later not a response 

Needless to say this was our third and last visit, consumer beware take your business elsewhere and where you will be treated and responded to timely and courteously.",1
"We went for our anniversary dinner and sat out in the garden. The whole space is beautiful and the ambiance is great for a special occasion. We started w table side Caesar for two that we wanted to like, but it was so severely overdressed that I felt sick immediately after. The entrees, (prawns and ahi tuna), were okay and the sides were overpriced, (polenta squares and five onion rings, for $16 each). We were expecting a big bill at a fancy restaurant, but really wish the food had been better. The staff was great, super polite and attentive, especially the friendly server who made the table side Caesar.",2
"Nice environment. But food, not too bad, a little bit expensive.",3
"Could not have had a better experience. Everyone was so friendly as soon as we walked in. We had the most amazing experience with our server Kosta, he was so friendly and knew everything about the menu. The caesar salad was such a fun experience. Francesco was so friendly and made the best caesar salad we've ever had. After our dinner we moved outside for another drink and the view of the CN Tower from the patio is beautiful! Our server outside was also extremely friendly. The BlueBlood staff were all so amazing and I would certainly say this is one of the best places to get steak in Toronto. The seafood was also amazing.",4
It was good. The steak was a bit overcooked and dry but the service was great. Bread was good.,3
"Everyone was very welcoming, very good service and food was amazing!",4
"The food was very well done, the environment was well managed, and the servers are wonderful - very polite and professional.",4
This was a wonderful experience. Many upscale steakhouses feel the need to emphasize their status--Bluebloods does not. I was comfortable throughout and I never felt out of place. And the food was delicious!,4
Service was excellent and food was superb. If you take the building for what it is and accept that it isn‚Äôt a modern facility you can move past the lack of air flow and appreciate its beauty. Would definitely come back again!,4
"I came here for dinner to celebrate my mom‚Äôs birthday. She absolutely loved it and I couldn‚Äôt agree more. I wish I got my waiter‚Äôs name because he deserves recognition for being so attentive. The day before I called to switch outdoor seating to indoor because the weather called for rain and that was handled with no problems. 

We were asked to wear masks when walking through the restaurant to our seats which I expected but the staff had extra masks for those who didn‚Äôt. We ordered quite a bit of food but we shared most of it which was nice that the portions were generous. I‚Äôve been telling everyone that this was the best steak I‚Äôve ever had and I mean it!! The tenderloin was so tender and most, it has me reminiscing as I type. 

The waiter even put a candle on a cheesecake for my mom‚Äôs birthday which I truly appreciated. Yes the restaurant is pricey but for the service, quality of food and ambience you get what you pay for. It‚Äôs an amazing restaurant to go to for a special occasion or for a treat. I‚Äôd definitely recommend it to others and I‚Äôm sure to be back!",4
"My daughter and I loved the restaurant. The food, service and waiter was great. We were on the patio, which had a great view. A little pricey, but were celebrating my daughters ""25th Birthday"". We had a w!!",4
We had to Ask The server repeatedly for anything we wanted. The wagyu steak was quite fatty.  It was my daughter‚Äôs birthday and a friend called ahead to order us dessert on them. It was put on our bill. Not what you expect when spending $1000 to $2000 on an evening!,1
"Excellent place to have dinner, nice ambiance and excellent food!",4
"It was simply an amazing service. Our waiter there, Sergio, was absolutely incredible. We had reserved for 10:30 pm and I had call the restaurant before during the day to ask some questions and they mentioned to me that their kitchen closes at 10:45-10:50 pm, therefore in my head, we had to hurry and even decide what to eat before we get there (check the menu through their website), but Sergio was very nice and told us to not worry when the kitchen is closing and to let him worry about that and to not feeling rushed at all.

I had taken a mojito and at first it was flat, I asked to have it changed and they did it in a heartbeat and even gave me a little glass bottle of sprite on the side if it the drink did not have enough: absolutely lovely waiter and staff.

Don't even get me started with the food. The food is simply way too amazing. The steak is so juicy, so thick, so tender (medium-well), so damn good. I had taken a ribeye and it's definitely the best ribeye I've eaten with the cognac peppercorn sauce. Way too good.

The place itself is absolutely gorgeous. Very beautiful. I thought at the beginning it was a mansion, but in fact, it is a castle (thanks to Sergio for letting us know). The outside, their patio: simply amazingly beautiful. It was raining, we were supposed to eat outside, but this restaurant is so well equipped and professional that they had reserved us a spot inside in case of the weather.

I could give a 1000000 out of 10. I'm definitely going back when I come back in Toronto.",4
"Shout out to Tatiana, Jeff and Mike for always providing OVER THE TOP service. The food is ALWAYS amazing and never disappoints. If you never been here, you MUST go. The best spot in the 6.",4
Was nice and would come again,4
"Really liked the appetizers but did not care for the steak, it was chewy.",3
We order the sea tower for two and it was not fresh totally frozen seafood and overprice ! The steak in the other hand was perfectly cooked the second time the bring it to us the made a few mistakes with the order but they were really gracious and apologetic about it I think that overall the place is overrated !,3
"Fantastic experience celebrating bf‚Äôs bday! Everything was top notch. Definitely on a pricey side, but worth for a special occasion.",4
"We sat on the patio at a lovely table.  It was a special occasion to celebrate my Dad‚Äôs birthday.  The service was very attentive except (strangely) the mains came very quickly after our appetizers.  Otherwise, the timing was fine.  It is definitely pricey, but you pay for a wonderful space, and very good space.",3
"Food extremely amazing! Other than the roasted organic Cornish hen. Extremely dry. It looks fried. Nothing like the picture on Instagram which looked savoury. My sister did say she didn‚Äôt like it but waiter ignored us. 

Our waiter was ok, he seems to be selling than suggesting items on the menu. 
As soon as we paid he left and moved on. Didn‚Äôt take our group pic as he said he would. I had to ask another worker there who was more than happy to do it.",4
"Not cheap, but service and food were outstanding. Massive and varied wine list. Had the seafood tower, which was great, and fantastic burger with incredible fries. Baked Alaska for dessert. They made a special occasion extra special.",4
"Slow, inattentive service. Steak overcooked. Food mediocre. Not worth the high cost. Most other steakhouses in Toronto offer a better value. Too bad because it‚Äôs a nice patio",2
"It was absolutely delicious, great service, perfect table away from everyone else.  I had a fabulous birthday dinner with my family, thank you",4
One of the best outdoor dining venues in toronto.,4
Few items I didn‚Äôt like with my order the octopus and the short rib was really dry,4
The outdoors patio was beautiful. Service was impeccable as always. Food was perfect. Thank you !!,4
"If you are there just for the scenery, the garden restaurant is for you. If you are there for the food and service, there are many other options out there.",0
"What a wonderful dinner to celebrate my sons 25th birthday.  The food, service and ambience  was outstanding.",4
"An elegant venue, with courteous and professional staff. Delicious food and drink!  Love the gardens and terraces.  Love the mood, so romantic!!",3
"Made a reservation for my nieces 18th birthday and coming out of covid I was trying to find the appropriate restaurant. This was the first time dining inside since the pandemic started and I have to say I couldn‚Äôt have had a better experience. 
The food was just absolutely delicious and presented well, the service was just Top notch. Our server for that Evening was Trevor and he was very attentive with our group especially considering he was very busy. He‚Äôs the type of server that makes a good restaurant into a GREAT ONE and he definitely help make my nieces 18th birthday one she‚Äôll never forget. Thank you to all the staff and I look forward to dining with you again. GREAT JOB!",4
"Fantastic experience. Great service, great food! We went for a treat birthday meal and it did not disappoint!",4
For true steak lovers they will definitely enjoy the experience.,4
"Been here on many occasions in the past but this time around the food was underwhelming.

Service and opportunity to get out was nice but again the food was underwhelming.",3
The best experience ever,4
Food was amazing and the patio was beautiful at night. One of the best steakhouses in the city.,4
"customer service started off unpleasant but as the night continued the services improved. I appreciated that the host was attentive & friendly which made our experience quite enjoyable. The appetizer was delicious, the cocktail drinks were impressive & my main meal great. My overall experience was great.",4
"We really enjoyed the setting, sitting on patio . The service was attentive but not annoying and the food was ample. Quality was superb. Highly recommend",4
Great food,4
"Amazing!! Our server was also excellent as well, perfect for birthdays",4
"Dax and his ‚Äúassistant‚Äù Trevor gave us amazing recommendations. The food and service was absolutely spectacular. We had a magical night, we definitely will be coming back again!",4
My wife and I went Anniversary,3
Excellent choice for special occasions. Lovely and scenic patio.,4
"Our server was helpful with a sense of humour.  The wife's steak was outstanding, as was my wagyu burger - the brioche bun and the thick cut fries, amazing.  We also had the cabrese salad and the Alaska crab fritters - both exceeding expectations.  The patio was nicely set up and tables were appropriately social distanced from other diners.  The manager, Mike went out of his way to show us some of the grounds when we requested.  We will definitely be dining at Blueblood again.",4
"The food was great however, we decided to bring our leftovers home and found 2 strands of blonde hair in the potato gratin...",3
"We were seated to the side of the castle, near the parking lot. It‚Äôs still a pretty patio, but not the view I would have hoped for. Our particular waiter was an average wait staff, but not what I would have expected at this establishment. The young lady who made the table side Caesar salad was spectacular. Friendly, engaged in conversation-and the salad was great.
We ordered a steak-it was good (unsure if it was $60 good, but it was good), Cornish hen-was good, tuna steak-was good. The whipped potatoes were good & the baked potatoes were both dry. And the coconut cream pie was the best part of dinner. All in all it was a nice experience.",3
"Excellent place. Unfortunately they served our steaks mismatched. I received a medium rare and my dining companion receive a medium... when we had ordered the opposite. When you are ordering An expensive piece of meat ... this is a big miss.  
Otherwise this place rocks. I would even go as far to say - best place to go for a celebratory dinner in Toronto!",3
"This was my first time attending BB as a guest ( I usually host client events here) so it was nice to get to fully enjoy a meal here without running around myself.

We came here for an overdue anniversary dinner and were blown away by the set up and view on the patio outside. 

Service is not up to the same calibre as it was pre-covid but do not fault them on this; remember that your servers have doubled their steps they need to take to serve you, are thrown off by new layouts/table numbers, new staff have been brought in and the stress of the pandemic......they're doing fantastic all things considered.

We ordered a bottle of sparkling, steak, burger, foie and carpaccio -> 10/10 for all",4
Was a good restaurant,2
"Where do I begin? it was Spectacular ! It was our first time dining at Blue Blood and boy was it amazing. From food, to service to the ambiance it was extraordinary. My husband and I went on our Tuesday's Date Night and Blue Blood definitely left us with the most pleasant experience. We came in and were greeted at the front desk. We were asked to wait until our table was ready. The host directed us to our table and we met our waiter Connor. He was great. Very friendly , professional and knowledgeable about the menu. We wanted steak but could not decide which cut to take. I asked for the most delicate cut of meat, without hesitation Connor said ; the wagyu. Wagyu tasting it was. They brought 3 different cuts of steaks (American, Japanese, and Australian). Our favorite one was the Japanese Wagyu. It was melt-in-the mouth type of cut. We then finished the night with some cake. We got the Coconut pie and let me tell you coming from a baker such as myself ... you will NOT regret it. It was so delicious. I would come back just for the cake, it was that good! Overall experience, 5 out of 5. To top off the night, the manager went from table to table and asked for feedback. We were extremely pleased with this steak house. It would not be the same experience if the service wouldn't be up to par. Connor , special thanks to you for outstanding and professional service. Chefs, thank you for providing amazing menu , Casaloma - definitely coming back here. Occasion or no occasion, highly recommend.",4
Nice environment and a but the food doesn‚Äôt not worth its price.,2
Service was great from start to the end.,4
"All around very enjoyable evening: great ambience; table nicely spaced; attentive service from Kosta; top quality food: highly recommend caesar salad and Erin Farm bone in rib eye; Craig the General Manager very understanding and accommodating: responding well and professionally to my special request. Thanks Craig!

Will come back again soon. The patio was packed on a tuesday evening! 

Room for improvement: do without the $15 parking for restaurants patrons especially when it is not valet parking.",4
"My favourite restaurant and patio in the GTA . The view, the service, the food.... They have a fantastic champagne selection, and really, what better place to dine than a castle with a view?",4
"Amazing from start to finish.  Great wine, food and ambience.  We can‚Äôt wait to go back with some friends and try out more of the options!!",4
eating steak at a castle. the food was delicious and the service was top class. The steak and apps are well proportion and the ambience is best in the city.,4
Too expensive for no reason . Steak is not the greatest . The keg is better . It‚Äôs a rip off . Definitely don‚Äôt recommend it . Very disappointed and would never go again. But the servers are nice and very polite . That‚Äôs the only thing positive.,0
"Ambiance:
We booked for the patio based on the photos provided on the website.   When we arrived we were seated at a table on the patio that looked like your everyday patio table in a high traffic area.   No table cloth... tippy table.... for a 5 star very expensive steak house I expected a lot better.   There was no dress code enforced... there were a number of people on the patio in cut off shorts, T-shirt‚Äôs and spandex jogging shorts and joggers.   Again not what I would expect from a fine dining restaurant.   It was like we were at a pub at the cottage.   

Food and Drinks:
The pre dinner drinks were excellent.  The mixologists here are fantastic and make great cocktails.   The wine selection we chose for dinner was also excellent.  
The steaks (a USA Waygu Rib Steak and Tenderloin for my GF) were over cooked.   Ordered rare to no more then medium rare ... and got medium-well done.   We were on a time crunch for another engagement and didn‚Äôt have time to send them back.   Again I would expect a place selling waygu steaks to have the staff that knows how to cook them.  The sides:.. the so called duck fat fries (which are huge cut fries) were not cooked in duck fat.  I cook with duck fat and I know the difference.   They were not crispy and all in all a disappointment.   The home made ketchup is bland.   

We skipped dessert and left out of disappointment with this experience.   For a 500.00 bill this is outrageously low quality.  

The service:
The service staff (along with the bartenders) are the shining stars  to this establishment.  We tipped generously (20%) despite the low quality food and ambiance ala pub patio.   

This is my second time here and the first time was much much better (we sat inside before COVID).  

I am not usually this critical in my reviews as everyone has a bad day, but for the money spent, expectations were much higher then what we received.   

Alas, I do not anticipate eating here again.",2
"Food and service was excellent. Loved the patio area, beautiful scenery. Our waiter was great. Apprecitee the anniversary gift and card. Will definitely be back again soon.",4
"Excellent dinner and very nice view of the city skyline. A little pricey, but well worth it for a special occasion. Food was nicely presented, good temperature and tasty. The lobster cakes were amazing and there was a good selection of wine offered. I would recommend this Restaurant.",3
One of the most expensive restaurants I've ever been to.,3
Outstanding food and service!,4
Gorgeous outdoor patio with incredible view of the Toronto skyline. Delicious food and exceptional service!,4
"Food was horrible and mostly cold. There was 2 of us celebrating a birthday. We ordered the octopus and oysters which came to our table about 4-5 min after we ordered it. Octopus was cold, chewy, and didn‚Äôt have much flavour. Oysters were okay....
We also ordered the lobster Mac and cheese, truffle potatoes, shrimp cocktail, and the lobster tail - none of which had flavour or salt. Also ordered the waygu sirloin which was ok but not that hot. We had cream br√ªl√©e for dessert which seemed clearly pre made as the top sugar area was cold.

Expect a lot better for $500...",0
"We enjoyed our celebration dinner, our server was discrete, knowledgeable and helpful.
the special touches both at the beginning and the end were memorable and appreciated.",4
"This was my 40th bday celebration with my partner and his parents. It rained, but that actually made it a more unique and memorable experience. The Umbrella leaked a little but the weather was humid so we didn‚Äôt mind getting a little wet. Our server was really great, he had a very positive and happy energy. 
I really appreciated the gift, I thought it was very tasteful and appropriate. 
Overall, it was a great night and I thank Liberty for the effort and experience. 

Best,
Michelle",4
Birthday dinner.  The evening was exceptional.,4
"First time but won't be our last time was my bday and my wife told me about this place after googling it lol anyway no regret , parking for a good price for downtown, greeted nicely and shown to our table , everyone well spaced out due to covid servers all wore masks , we ordered the cdn porterhouse which was superb ,along with the tasty mashed potatoes ,and brocolini we started with the wagyu beef carpaccio and Alaska crab fritters both delicious . We loved the food and lookout and the great service they even gave me a small gift for my birthday lol all in all a must do in Toronto and for us a must eat again .",4
"Was a perfect time,the meal was great, the atmosphere was very inviting and the service the our waiter Donaldo gave was exceptional.
Parking was easy and on the grounds.

Will definitely be back.

Again thank you to  Donaldo.",4
This was one of the most memorable dining experiences of my life.  Will go again,4
"There were some hornets üêù fly around our table during the dinner. We asked the waiter to drive away the hornets, but there was no one to help. We were so upset that my wife got bitten on her right ring finger. The restaurant did nothing to apologize. We were disappointed.",0
"Lovely experience, sommelier Mary Claire was outstanding.",4
"Had an amazing birthday dinner at Blue Blood. 
Unfortunately I received an emergency phone call and had to quickly leave.  The staff was extremely professional and understanding.  Although we were only about 3 quarters of the way through our meal, they were extremely quick to pack up our leftovers for us to take and also bring our bill. 

Was very sad that the night was cut short on my end.  But the experience was absolutely incredible. 
Will definitely be going back ASAP",4
"At these prices, the steak should be the star of the meal.

Sadly, it is not.",1
"Amazing food, amazing service, gorgeous setting, beautiful view. My experience was incredible!",4
"Four of us came here for dinner to celebrate a milestone anniversary and birthday. BlueBlood'a had lovely patio areas set up, especially along the west side of the building. You might get a better view from the south side (back gardens) but that would be much more crowded. The service was excellent! Very attentive at all the right times. 
* We started off with the table side Caesar salad. It was much better than what we had expected. The portion was also much larger than we had anticipated. Had we known it would be as large as it was, we would not have ordered two of the other appetizers. Would definitely order that again.
* Alaskan crab fritters - we didn't care for this as it was a bit too doughy for our liking. Then again it is a fritter.
* Short rib ravioli - nice little appetizer with a decent amount of meat. 
* Caprese salad - delicious and fresh!
* Sesame crusted Ahi tuna - very nice & tasty. We all agreed that we would order it again.
* Veal Osso Bucco - very tender and delicious. Good size portion too. 
* Polenta Squares - crispy with a very slight hint of heat. I have a very sensitive palette so could taste the spiciness. However, no one else at the table could taste the heat.
* Cr√®me br√ªl√©e - the one person at the table who doesn't like desserts and who would usually only have one bite, ended up having the whole thing all by herself. We will definitely be ordering that again!
* Table-side banana crapes - OMG, I hadn't had this in a very long time. So glad we ordered it. Very delicious! Only problem was, we were already so full from the dinner that we couldn't truly enjoy this dessert.
* Black raspberry and white chocolate cheesecake - a big slice is cake! It had a really nice balance of flavours and it wasn't too sweet. 

We had a great experience and would good back for sure!",4
Trevor was excellent. We attended for a birthday and to celebrate our engagement. We couldn‚Äôt have ask for a better evening. Thank you BlueBlood Steakhouse.,4
Staff were very considerate and professional. Food was to perfection.,4
felt rushed from when we were seated and before our food was served it looked like it was about to rain and the servers were willing to serve the food in the rain without finding a soultion and made it feel like we still were on the hook even we ate the food or not.... the only person trying to make an effort was Sergio,1
"The food was not bad but the experience was not the best. The waiters had such a bad attitude, seems like they're very poorly trained.",2
4 year anniversary,4
Great experience. Highly recommend,3
We loved our dinner at Blueblood steak house. The service was excellent and the food was delicious. Amazing ambiance and patio scenery.,4
This restaurant was beyond our expectations. The staff were really friendly and attentive. The food was superb and the environment was so peaceful and calm. We would definitely recommend it to anyone and will be happy to come back again.,4
Fantastic meal! Loved the place! So nice to sit in and the service was excellent!,4
Patio seating has great views and is shaded due to the Castle. Waiter was great and very knowledgeable. Food came out in a very timely manner. Highly recommend!,4
"**So my girlfriend and I usually dine however she is super insecure whenever we go out due to her peanut/sesame allergies.**

To begin, two days prior to our reservation I received a call confirming our reservation as well was notified that the entire staff was given a heads up about my girlfriend allergies.. this has never happened before in any restaurant we‚Äôve ever been to in Toronto - fabulous and made my gf feel a lot better about going out for our anniversary.

Second, as soon as we got there at least 3-4 different staff members approached my partner confirming her allergies - again super professional and made her feel even better.. happy wife happy life.

Third, our waiter Dax could of been sent from heaven and I wouldn‚Äôt know the difference. He was kind, courteous, knowledgeable, professional, and most important great at his job. He made fantastic recommendations and called over the sommelier whenever needed. 

I will be back and two accounts: 

1) Dax

2) the awareness to peanut/sesame allergies

Well done Blue Blood.. you made my anniversary one to remember!",4
"The patio setting (which is all there is during covid) is on the most part very well laid out and can be outright outstanding but largely depends upon where you are seated.  

Service is extremely professional and cordial but not warm and personal and missing attention to details such as table clearing and cleaning between courses.

Food on the most part is acceptable and good but not exceptional.

Beer is served cool but not ice cold and turns warm quickly, so a bit unsatisfying unless you are German and like drinking beer warm.

Overall seems more of an occasional destination that everyone should experience with people they haven‚Äôt seen in a long time or with out of towners than a place to put on your list of regular places to dine; unless you are the type that is more easily impressed with surface (castle and elegant people) than with substance (food and drinks).

I would still recommend it to my friends as it is worth a visit to judge for yourself.",3
"My boyfriend and I have dined here a number of times, in particular, we come every year for our anniversary dinner. The menu has (finally) been updated and we are very pleased with more delicious options.

With dietary restrictions, our waiter and the BlueBlood staff ensured to meet our expectations!

Beautiful evening, great service, delicious food!",4
New terrace area is best place to be in Toronto during covid!,4
Food was mediocre and not worth the price. Was disappointed due to all the amazing reviews i‚Äôve read but it was still a good experience overall. Server was nice and it was a bit busy so I understand why the service was slower. They gave me a birthday gift and card so that was a very nice surprise!,2
"The food was delicious and the staff were extremely friendly. They didn't check in too frequently and gave us our space. There were a ton of social distancing precautions, the servers walked around multiple times with sanitize and had very minimal contact without taking away from good customer service. I would go back to celebrate any occasion in a heart beat.",4
"$15 for parking at the restaurant! Not a good start...
Main courses at 60-200 and over come with no Vegetable or starches companions. It is extra at app $20 each dish.
My medium-rare steak was medium at best. It was my husband's birthday and I didn‚Äôt want to make a fuss. We both knew at that stage that this is the first and last time we come here.
Being a patron in Covid days I was expecting more appreciation from the place.

Very very disappointing!!!!",0
Excellent !,4
Graduation dinner,3
A unique ambiance with one of a kind location in Toronto.,4
Excellent?,3
"Food was horrible. Dry steak, chef unaware of medium rare cooking temperature, overdone. Sent steak back and the second steak came out cooked equally as poor and flavourless. Octopus starter also overdone and rubbery. Flamb√© crepes station at dessert shut off midway and was still served the crepe - nothing special. The grounds were beautiful. Unfortunately the hostesses at the front had no idea of what was available or accessible on the grounds and were rude in addressing my questions. Waiter was inattentive and service declined throughout the duration of the meal. One would think that the staff would really try to get things right as restaurants are now accepting patrons post covid, but this dinner was definitely lacking on all fronts. Not impressed for the price tag.",0
"Our family had dinner at BlueBlood for a birthday.  The outdoor patio overlooking downtown Toronto and the green garden was memorable for a beautiful summer evening.     We asked to move table before seating to an empty table for a better view of the city and one of suited hosts was very quick to accommodate without hesitation. Very nice touch to make the evening more special. Food was very nice and the ambiance was memorable with Casa Loma, downtown city view and garden. Very memorable experience for a family birthday.",4
"I can‚Äôt rave enough about BlueBlood. Even during a pandemic, the service did not falter even a little bit. The food was excellent and memorable. Our server Sergio was kind, attentive and knowledgeable. He made our evening so lovely. Despite how busy the restaurant was, he did not rush us which is a rarity in a crowded city during a Friday night reservation. If you haven‚Äôt seen what they‚Äôve done with their patio, you have to see it for yourself. At night the whole castle lights up and you have a beautiful view of the city. I can‚Äôt wait to come back.",4
Great time.,3
"Amazing, like always.",4
This was a lovely experience. My parents and I went here for their anniversary and everything was perfect! From ambience to food to service... it was superb.,4
"It was our first time at this restaurant. Pretty expensive, however, it was worth it. With great and tasty food and exceptional service, I made the right choice for our engagement dinner. We will definitely come back for our next special occasion.",4
"My short rib Wellington was a bit dry inside. After asking for more jus it was much better
 Pastry was delicious. Atmosphere outside was wonderful",4
The tables are perfectly situation away from each other.,4
You will not regret the money spent here! Everything was perfection. From the sitting selection to the desert and everything in between. My partner booked more reservations while at dinner!  we loved it and truly felt like a queen and king!,4
"We had a great time celebrating our anniversary at the BlueBlood Steakhouse. It‚Äôs a beautiful place. The outdoor terrace was beautiful. We got a nice seat overlooking the city and backing the castle. It was Canada‚Äôs day and can watch fireworks from the patio. Great value for food and drinks. We ordered their Australian Wagyu and it was delicious. Overall, beautiful spot for a nice date and friends gathering. We will be back soon.",3
Wedding anniversary,4
"Fantastic view of the city from the terrace  and the steak is the BEST in the city (and I have been to pretty much every upscale steakhouse in TO), service was great also - it is pricy so be prepared to spend! Worth it though!",4
"The brioche bun of the foie gras was way too oily...
Lobster was good but steak too fatty as well",3
Excellent food and fantastic service by Sergio. A truly fabulous experience,4
Excellent experience! We were very happy with evetything.,4
Beautiful patio.  Excellent food.  Just don't order too many sides because each of them is good for about 3 or 4 people.  Service was excellent.,4
"Great time, delicious food and nice server. It's obviously an expensive restaurant, but we felt the service and food was worth the price.",4
Everyone was very pleasant,4
"The food was amazing! Our server, Dax, was even better. Overall experience 10/10",4
Absolutely amazing ! Service and food was impeccable üëåüèº,4
"Excellent service! Beautiful patio. Stunning evening, thank you!",4
"Food was good, but desert (proliferol) had too much sauce and became like a soup at the end.",4
Awesome start to finish! Food was great! Service was exceptional!,4
The hosts and servers were very kind and accommodating. The patio was nicely set up with a wonderful view!,4
Was an amazing experience. Our server Dax walks us through the whole menu and gave us the perfect advice to help us have an incredible meal. The service the food was amazing. Dax even brought us down for photos by the fountain. Amazing restaurant amazing food and amazing price. Will definitely come back.,4
The food was amazing. The view was also amazing. Everything about this restaurant was 10/10 would highly recommend this place.,4
Fantastic service - great food,4
The patio is gorgeous & the view looking over the city is stunning. I will be back again as soon as I am able.,4
The servers were very welcoming and obviously still working out some of the kinks of reopening. The food was very good and we had a great view overlooking downtown.,3
"Waiter was slow to return and take orders, refill drinks. Outstanding food.",3
This place by far is the best restaurant I have ever been to. From the food to the ambience and the private tour of Casa Loma after dinner. It all was just amazing.,4
It was a very amazing experience! Our server Dax was amazing and very attentive!,4
Enjoyable and fun evening,3
Had a great time celebrating colleagues retirement!,4
"It was my boyfriends 30th birthday. I was quite surprised there was nothing special done for him, or offered to me that I can make extra special for him. The service was otherwise amazing. Super helpful sommelier. Our waiter was extremely nice but didn‚Äôt really have a recommendation of something to try when we asked for one. The meal was good. Mushrooms were a bit salty. The steak we ordered was undercooked but still tasted decent. The food wasn‚Äôt anything that you need to go out of your way for. The ambience and environment was amazing. Presentation of all food and drinks was outstanding. 
Overall a decent dining experience.",3
"Loved the experience, I would recommend to a friend",4
Loved the atmosphere and creative approach to service and food presentation. Decent food.,3
Loved absolutely every single thing about this restaurant - such a fantastic dining experience. From food to the gorgeous dining room and spectacular service - every detail was simply perfect!,4
"Food was excellent as expected, great ambience, gorgeous venue, the only complaint is that it was a tad stuffy/not as well ventilated as it could be.",3
"Nice for a novel evening, certainly not the best steaks in Toronto, but Service and Ambiance can't be beat.",3
"Wonderful both myself and my girlfriend absolutely loved the experience
Dax or Nax is the best server and waiter",4
"Highly recommend for the food, ambience and service. Everything recommended by the server was top notch. If i was to choose one reason to go there again it would be the food. The baked alaska is an absolute must try. Super thumbs up to the chefs and the rest of the staff.",4
Incredible service and food. Beautiful dining room.,4
"The food was delicious. The service was EXCELLENT. Upon being seated, we wanted to be moved to A larger booth and our server quickly communicated this to the hostess and we were moved within minutes.

Our server was professional, knowledgeable and extremely pleasant which enhanced the ambiance.

The icing on the cake was a private tour of Casa Loma which we received from Craig - the General Manager, AFTER we had paid our bill and were on our way out. 

He noticed that my girlfriend was very interested in the venue so he took it upon himself make our night that much better. There was no reason for him to do this outside of a pure dedication to his profession and to the clients he serves.

Would 100% recommend to anyone looking for a lovely evening, with family, friends or loved ones. Beautiful venue, delicious food and IMPECCABLE customer experience! Thank you ALL.",3
Superb service and food. Highly recommend the seafood tower.,4
"Costa, is the consummate professional. He is a gift to the service industry and Blueblood is lucky to have him. Costa makes you feel at home, welcomed, as if you're the only customer in the restaurant. He remembered all my kids favourite dishes and customized the seafood platter for me based on a single portion. Best waiter in town. Special mention to Tatiana for taking care of us last minute! Love bluebloods!",4
"Our server (I believe his name was Ian) was one of the best servers I have ever had. Both myself, and my friend, have been in the restaurant industry for +13 years, and he was an absolute delight. 

Steaks were incredible, the dry aged was substantially less Tender, but the flavour was incredible. 

The restaurant is beautiful, management checking in on us over the night was a wonderful touch. My friend was also delighted to find his napkin folded upon his return from the restroom. No detail too small. 

Only minor gripe: the Kale was not what either of us expected, and was the only item that we overlooked as we went on to dominate the table of food. The wine suggestion from the Sommelier was a perfect choice for our budget, and hit the spot with every sip. 

The final mic drop? The Black Raspberry White Chocolate Cheesecake. That was a slice of heaven that hit me close to my home in BC. 

Hats off to all, you were remarkable! See you soon!",4
"I chose this place to celebrate a birthday. 
It had a great atmosphere, decor, comfortable seating and food presentation....but that is about it. 

As for food, mediocre at best, edible, but definitely not worth the cost. Our courses were mixed up, and my $200 steak was cold. The remainder of the appetizers and salads were either over or under seasoned.  

Service, was the worst part of the experience. Extraordinarily slow, it took us 2h to complete 2 appetizers, a salad, and a steak. We are not slow eaters. Lots of downtime in between.....

Coat check was another issue, our server stated he would alert the front desk to have our coats ready...and after several minutes of no one around to help, I had to ask around.....this is not a big deal....but one expects service at the very least and a decent meal when one has paid close to $500 for two people for the meal and 18% courtesy tip, which I regret giving.....

Overall, I would never ever dine here again....
If you want great food and atmosphere consider Alo Bar and Alo for fine dining that is worth every penny....",0
"Our food was delicious and we very much enjoyed our dinner and the bar.  Service at the bar was superb.  We were seated near the window in the restaurant, which was quite nice.  The wait staff were attentive when we first arrived, as it was an early seating, but then seemed a bit understaffed later on.  We tried unsuccessfully to order crab cakes.  The most uncomfortable experience was the seating.  Booths were WAY too close together, chairs touching so my chair was being bumped by the guest behind me.  I also did not have adequate legroom.  On the upside, the manager gave us a brief tour of the castle after dinner, which we really appreciated.  I would recommend this restaurant with a caveat regarding seating.",4
"Very nice setting, elegant surroundings and great food.",3
We celebrated my husbands birthday and we gave this place a 10/10. Service was amazing from start to finish.,4
This is a must have experience. The staff was at your beck and call the entire meal.wennever felt rushed and their suggestions were spot on. Food was excellent and the castle is amazing.,4
"This place blows me away. It is always very clean, hostess and servers are very nice and attentive. Incredible food. I have nothing but good things to say.",4
"Our server was incredible. To eat there was on my wife‚Äôs bucket list. Broken leg and all she made it there and the server and the cooks didn‚Äôt disappoint. 

And the guy who sits there and slips wine for taste. I am jealous 

Cheers.",4
Incredible space but food is not worth the price. It was decent but not what I would expect for a $250 steak.,0
Attention to the small details made this experience exceptional,4
"Simply amazing! Wouldn‚Äôt find anything like this place anywhere else in Toronto, only New York City has few surprises like this. Not just beautiful decor in three rooms to choose from & each with different flavour and atmosphere but the most wonderful service. Everything is simply the best! It was my birthday and the staff come up with few surprises which were exception and truly memorable. On my birthdays we go or fly to different places to celebrate and so far number one for us was Cafe Roval in Miami where we went last year and Le Chantecler in Nice a year before. Must say BlueBlood Steakhouse beats them all. Bravo to Nick Di Donato and Liberty Group for taking over this run down place from Kiwanis Club and turning it into real treasure!",4
Service was amazing! Food was delicious!,4
"Expensive but fantastic steaks
4 of us shared the wagu tasting And the tomahawk. But, we got what we paid for. Better than fantastic. 
Much better tomahawk than Harbour 60, thicker juicier with less fat in it. 
The best Caesar salad ever",4
"Had a marvelous anniversary dinner with my husband, will definitely be back. We were very well taken care of and enjoyed the food, service, and ambiance very much. Server was knowledgeable, and made excellent suggestions from the menu. Those Once Upon a Time cocktails were divine!",4
"Fabulous location and ambiance. 
The service was exceptional and the food was superb. An unforgettable experience.",4
It was our first time at the restaurant.  We truely enjoyed ourselves and will return again in the near future.,4
"Everything was wonderful from the service to the food. We would have liked a table a little more intimate instead of in the middle of a room but that was still ok. 
Look forward to returning",4
Great steak house with a unique ambiance. Service is attentive and prompt.,4
Blue blood is by far one of our favourite restaurants in the city. We have been several times now and it never disappoints. The food is incredible and everything is cooked perfectly. We have had subpar service on other visits but we have now been served twice by Vito and I can‚Äôt say enough about him. He is attentive and engaging. Extremely personable and always making sure you are happy. The management staff is also great and visited our table several times to make sure we were happy with everything. We will be back again soon.,4
Incredible Experience,4
"This was actually my second time coming here for Valentine's and was a little disappointed. Valet parking was only taking cash and they made me use the ATM machine in the basement of the castle which cost a fee + the fee my bank charges me.

Service was good and ambiance is always spot on. However, was not a huge fan of the Valentine's desert that the waiter assured me was 10x better than what I initially wanted to get. It tasted stale like something they made yesterday. For the kind of money I was spending that night was a little disappointed.",2
"My fianc√© and I were so impressed with the service at Blue Blood. Waiters and general managers were attentive throughout, ensuring that our enjoyment was #1. We felt well taken care of with respect to some dietary restrictions (and menu modifications) as well.  We went to celebrate our anniversary and were even gifted with a card and bottle stoppers at the end of our meal. The GM knew we were interested in the castle history, and even spent several minutes giving us a tour afterwards. We will definitely be back!",4
I took my wife and son to Bluebloods Steak house for Valentines Day dinner. We had a great time and they were very accommodating to my son who is 7. The food was great and the service was excellent. We weren't to fond of the baked Alaska dessert and they server was so kind as to have it removed from our bill. It was a great experience.,3
We celebrated the birthday of one of us at this excellent venue. The food was fantastic as usual.,4
"Wonderful service, wonderful food, beautiful spot.",4
"Good, but on the expensive end",3
"The Sommelier, Marie was terrific.  Food was great, atmosphere great.  Will definitely be back soon with more clients.",4
"Just went here last night to celebrate my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday. Absolutely outstanding! Best steak we‚Äôve ever had in our lives! The service is incredible, the food, the ambience... everything! It is quite upscale, (ended up paying almost $400 with gratuity)  so won‚Äôt be a regular outing for us, but as a special celebration? Absolutely treat yourself!!",4
2 birthdays lovely evenings we will return!,4
The reason to go to a steakhouse is the steak which was cooked as requested but was not tender as expected for the price paid.,3
Food is great but service is no good at all compared to similar caliber steakhouses,3
"I proposed to my fiancee on 02/08/2020 at this incredible restaurant. I made a special request upon booking of my proposal plans and our server was on board.  Unfortunately, given each server is a specialist in each portion of the menu, my cover was almost blown when asked our reasoning for visiting the restaurant. The message was definitely not passed along to the rest of the staff. I persevered nonetheless. Our evening was memorable with a wonderful 35 day dry aged ribeye (served complimentarily with Hawaiian volcanic salt, some other delicious fancy (couldn't hear the waiter) salt, and pink Himalayan salt. You do not need flavouring with their selection. Complimentary truffle bread, whipped truffle mashed potatoes, and wild mushrooms. Oh, and a jalape√±o scallop mango entree was amazing. I saw my moment and presented my heart to the love of my life. 

***Our wonderful waiter brought us each an incredible bottle of champagne following the proposal complimentary. I am without words. This place will always have a permanent memory in our lives.

Should you visit this restaurant? If you like steak then absolutely. 
Should you propose at this place? Well, It's a castle and the food/ambiance is next to nothing. She should say yes. 
Should you come here if a spot is open? Sure, it's justifiably pricy although you won't be disappointed. Please try the Wagyu for me.",4
The most amazing experience...best I've ever had for any restaurant in Toronto. The service was beyond impeccable and everyone there made me feel like royalty. The food was a delight to all the senses. It's like they are serving art on a plate. We loved it so much that we have already booked our table for our anniversary in April!,4
"Love this place . Excellent service & good food . 
My husband & me enjoy so much ! For sure will come visit again .",4
"We had a group of 5 and Andy took amazing care of us, as the rest of the staff! Great night!",4
AMAZING the food was so good and the service is amazing. The scenery is beautiful and all together it was the best.,4
The ambiance and cuisine are exquisite and is a highly recommended culinary experience.,4
"Fantastic!!! The venue is beautiful, the service and food is excellent!!!",4
"I ordered a seafood tower and the lobster that they put in the tower was empty . It was just the shell of the lobster , no meat , for $85 that wasn‚Äôt acceptable.  It said it was for two people and I got it alone and wasn‚Äôt enough . Very disappointing.",3
"Blue Blood was wonderful, dinner was great. Only thing that threw me off was at the end of our meal we weren‚Äôt offered a tour as many other tables around us were.",3
Great food. Friendly service. Very nice atmosphere,4
Service was late and and unattentive. Lights were to dimmed and loud environment not conducive of conversation nor enjoyment of the surroundings.,2
"Excellent overall experience, very accommodating and cool birthday gift!!",4
"Phenomenal service. Excellent food. It's what you expect from a restaurant of this caliber, and they delivered.",4
"They made our anniversary dinner so special. On top of the food and atmosphere being beyond incredible, they gave us an anniversary gift and private tour of the castle. We will forever cherish our anniversary dinner at BlueBlood Steakhouse and Casa Loma!",4
Great experience!,4
"Absolutely fantastic experience, was blown away by the quality of the food and service. Easily one of the best places in Toronto.",4
"The ambiance, staff and overall experience is fabulous. It's fine dining at it's best so and the price reflects as such. Nice place for an occasional visit. Average person cannot afford to go on a regular basis. Very expensive.",3
"We really enjoyed out evening and the service was great.
Cheers",4
It was a good night good food great service nice atmosphere,3
"The ambiance of the Oak Room is fantastic, the seating extremely cozy and comfortable.  The attentiveness of the staff is second to none with every question and need handled immediately.  The food was wonderful and made precisely as ordered.",4
"The Oak room atmosphere and booth seating were excellent.  Service was also very good from greeting to goodbye.  Unfortunately, the food was a BIG disappointment - the quality does not exceed or even meet the over-inflated price tag.  The Keg (at 1/3 the cost) would be a comparable meal and more satisfying.  The Caesar salad made at our table was mediocre at best and I was informed that the sides we ordered were all gluten-free, however there must've been flour in one dish as I did physically suffer.  The highlight of our evening was a guided tour of the castle's upstairs, we were extremely impressed and grateful for that.",1
"too darkÔºå can‚Äôt read the menu, the seat is beautiful, but the handle is kinda blocked me to use the knife, scallops were good, steak was ok, service was nice!",3
"Dinner in a castle!
Amazing cocktails, service and food. The location and ambiance cannot be surpassed anywhere.",4
Hi Steve here went to blue bloods for my anniversary heard a lot about it but still blew me out of the water amazing service and the best food I‚Äôve ever had would definitely go back many more times,4
"Came here for birthday. Food was good, the bone in ribeye was cooked exactly as ordered to med. rare.  The braised ribs were fork tender.  Service was excellent. The baked Alaskan is very Instagram worthy - although not to my taste (gf loved it).  Coincidentally went Tuesday and they had a live orchestra playing popular classical music .  Parking is $15 right next to the restaurant.  Highly Recommended for a special occasion.",4
Great vibe awesome staff,4
"Atmosphere 10 out of 10.  Ordered steak rare it came Cooked well done.  They took steak back to re make a new one, by the time it came back all the side dishes were cold. Then to make matters worse my girlfriend had not even started her salad when it was removed while she was not looking.",2
Amazing food but super expensive not for the faint of heart!! But amazing food. You get what you pay no doubt,3
I read all great reviews. And they lived up to the many praises.,4
Lovely . We had a wonderful time! Great service made it a special evening.,4
"The ambiance is spectacular. The food was delicious and the service was impeccable as the servers were knowledgeable, personable and very professional.",4
Beautiful interior design alongside the fancy  meals and things alongside it,4
"Absolutely fabulous dining experience. Certainly not the cheapest meal in the city. But it is more than made up for with quality of food, service, and setting. I would highly recommend this restaurant.",4
"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. Service is amazing. The attention to details as well from napkins to glasses with their logo just made our experience amazing. 
Food is excellent. A little pricy though.",3
"Beautiful restaurant - thoroughly enjoyed the dinner, service and atmosphere.",4
"I book the reservation for my sister‚Äôs 30th birthday and it was the best surprise. Great service, the steaks and side dishes were impeccable and the table side Alaska was the perfect conclusion for a special dinner. Many thanks for the whole staff!",4
Celebrating a 65th wedding anniversary.  It‚Äôs the only place to do it. The staff are so kind and considerate and to have it in a castle makes it special.  It was a special night magnified by the staff.  Thank you.,4
Amazing experience! Staff and food was incredible.,4
Great deco and the cesar salad as always incredible.,4
"A not to be missed Toronto experience. I was at first worried this place would fall into that tourist trap category of over priced and gimmicky. I was wrong! The atmosphere is absolutely incredible, luxurious and unique. Casa Loma is unlike any other location in Canada. The food is worth the price, absolutely one of the best meals of our lives. But the service! The service is incredible. The best we‚Äôve ever had in the city. They truly go out of their way to make you feel catered to and special, without being stuffy or pretentious in any way. We will absolutely go back and have been recommending it to all of our friends as a true dining experience.",4
"This place belongs on the Toronto Life top 100 restaurant list for it‚Äôs high quality of service, food and atmosphere. Been to many of the places on the list and no idea why they don‚Äôt pick this one.",4
Fantastic setting/ ambiance with food and cocktails to match,4
"This restaurant was spectacular. We loved every moment we were there. The room, food, and service was top notch. We will be recommending BlueBlood Steakhouse to family and friends in the future. 

What a wonderful evening! Thank you.",4
"My husband proposed to me at Casaloma so BlueBlood has an extra special place in my heart. That being said, the atmosphere and food is delicious. I‚Äôm an avid steak lover and they truly never disappoint. I LOVE the ambience in the bar lounge area and all the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Love this place",4
"Service was awesome, steak was done perfect but l had a side of lobster Mac, lobster meat over cooked ruined the dish, desert was awesome we had baked Alaska. All in all great place with good to great food.",3
It was a great experience and the waitress was very professional and polite .... Highly recommended,4
"It was our second time at this classy restaurant; we had family in from out of town, so we wanted them to experience eating in the restaurant and seeing this magnificen castle; the symphony was also scheduled to be playing on that date and time however it was cancelled without notifying us in advance; to compensate us, they gave us a complimentary private tour of the castle.  Still disappointing not to hear the orchestra but atleast the management tried to make it up to us in some manner.",3
Love the place.   Lots of atmosphere,4
A great place for a birthday or important client meal.,3
The service was excellent and the food was even better. Pure class and an elegant dining experience.,4
"The first time I dined here was back in 2018 and instantly fell in love with the restaurant. We were recommended to order the Tomahawk steak and since then has been a favourite of ours. This place will always hold a special place in my heart, considering that all the special moments in my life happened at the castle. Came here again over the weekend to celebrate my anniversary and the service and food seemed to be better each time. We noticed that the sweet potato ribbons were salty and without question, the manager took it back to the kitchen for a new batch. We were well taken care of and even left with a token from the restaurant. I truly appreciate that they read my reservation notes and it's such a thoughtful gesture because it means that they're attentive and they care about your dining experience. The whole thing was worth every penny.",4
Excellent service. Garth went above and beyond with our little girl age 5 who was dining with us. She is still talking about her declaration as Queen and can‚Äôt wait to see Garth in the future with his new coat of armour after she knighted him!!! Beautiful and memorable evening with great food and wonderful service!,4
Wonderful experience can‚Äôt wait to go back!!!  Thank you!,4
"Nice spot
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$",3
Excellent!!  Great atmosphere....service was great.  Friendly staff.,4
"The food was incredibly satisfying with lot's of options on the menu to suit all tastes. The servings were on point. The ambiance was appropriate for my party of two, with just the right amount of privacy. The added touches were surprising and the delivery of service was impeccable. This is what service should look like. We've been spoiled.",4
"Great historical place to visit with outstanding food and service. Best table side prepared Caesar salad we‚Äôve ever had, and the steaks were top grade and perfectly prepared. The ambience is a bit funky because you‚Äôre in a restaurant that‚Äôs inside a ‚Äúcastle‚Äù that used to be a private residence in the early 20th century, but the dining room and bar are lovely and make up for that. Do ask to sit in the main dining room. The bar was fine, but the main dining room is quite beautiful, cozy and elegant.",4
"Overall it was good. Although, it was a little bit overrated probably because of its location. I expected better service from our server.",3
"Excellent , the best stakehouse.",4
"From the moment we walked through the doors, the staff was warm and inviting. We sat down to a great meal and drinks in the beautiful dining room. Our server Costas also helped me arrange a proposal in the castle following our main courses. They truly made our experience the best it could possibly be. I will definitely be back!",4
Went here with my boyfriend for his birthday. Ordered a wagu and stripeloin steak and some veggies. We ordered a choco cake which was soso but the service was nice. Also You get to access casa loma for free as the resto is connected to the castle.,4
"Was great, excellent service and attention to detail.  Have always enjoyed ourselves here.

My only criticism is that it would be nice to have washrooms specific for the restaurant.  No issue with paying for premium dining experiences, which this is.  Having to wait in line with everyone that‚Äôs visiting Casa Loma that day isn‚Äôt as premium.",3
Food and service were exceptional...as usual.,4
My Favour place to eat,4
"We had a great evening, the service was fantastic. Having the Christmas music playing and all the Christmas decorations was beautiful. Just a great evening.",4
"Outstanding food, service and ambiance. Loved every minute even the birthday celebration. Will definitely be back! Thank you. Scott your doing an amazing job.  Cheers",4
Was a very good meal! Service was great! Nothing special was done for anniversary unfortunately and had to ask for our goodbye chocolate. We ended up switching waiters and got served by other people which got confusing. But food was great and ambiance was so nice.,4
"A beautiful setting, great service and food. Four of us shared 3 appetizers to start. Our son recommended that we shared a larger steak (cheaper than buying multiple steaks and they cut it for you - loved that option). We had everything like a sharing menu - eating family style. 

For sides we ordered the Gorgonzola gnocchis (delicious and very rich), steamed spinach (my favourite) and lobster Mac and cheese (The cheese sauce was Devine and large lobster chunks. The pasta had a bit of a crunchy pieces, but under the sauce seemed more tender). 

We shared the steak between three of us and one had the seared sushi grade tuna which was also delicious. 

Finished off with the amazing table side baked Alaska. Definitely worth it for the show and the taste. Save room for it, it‚Äôs a huge portion. 

Surprised to end with some chocolate truffles and a complimentary wine stopper for both myself and husband - as it was both of our birthdays. 

The wine took us over the top (2 bottles at $200 each) but the whole meal was $800 and tons of food. Not brain science, but if you skip the alcohol it‚Äôs a fairly well priced meal (plus you get to see the amazing Casa Loma main floor for free)",4
"It was a very special holiday dinner for myself and grandchildren.  My only complaint being that I didn't think to take any pictures since I was so in the moment.  Loved it and very glad that I took these young people to appreciate fine dining, a great atmosphere and each other.",4
"Food, service and entire experience was outstanding!  We will definitely be back and telling all our friends!  Thank you!!!",4
"The food was excellent, live music was lovely & the waiter made it that much more special with the food recommendations & great jokes!",4
"The short rib was very fatty, the broccoli was cold. The Caesar salad was not authentic. The ingredients where used to cut costs the .  A lot of show and flourish no real substance. A bit of joke. You can fool a lot of people. The food just isn‚Äôt that good..",2
Hands down the best restaurant in the 6,4
"A beautiful venue to spend a night together with friends and family. A great reason to check out an amazing building we so often pass right by. Very friendly welcome at the door as well as the whole staff! 
We will definitely come back.",3
First time going to the restaurant on a double celebration with my girlfriend.  Many special thanks to our server Sergio for making our dining experience a memorable one.  Great ambiance all around.  Highly recommend.,4
"Amazing time! Our server Trevor was amazing, the food was outstanding and with Christmas around the corner they made it feel whimsical. Didn‚Äôt feel rushed and they had amazing attention to detail, best anniversary dinner ever. Thanks to the staff and Trevor for the amazing night.",4
"We cannot stop raving about how exquisite our dinner tasted!  From the moment we arrived at the Restaurant to the moment we left, it was a wonderful experience!!",4
"Booked reservations to take my gf out for her birthday on Weds Dec 11th. We ordered the wagyu taster, garlic mashed, and asparagus which was all as amazing as the service we received from Dax. He was very knowledgeable and entertaining--you could really feel that he loves his job. His amazing service is actually the reason BlueBlood Steakhouse deserves a full 5* review. Thank you, Dax for making our night extra amazing!! Also, the oysters from the East cost with the sauces provided are a must try.",4
An awesome experience. The service was outstanding and the food was so good. The perfect place for special occasions.,4
"I was expecting a higher than average food quality. The steak was luke warm at best. The appetizer (crab cakes) tasted like it had been microwaved and was dry. The potato was dry and tasteless as were the side dish of asparagus tips !  Overall.... a disappointing food experience.

To add insult to injury, this was a birthday celebration and the ""house""  giveaway was a ""wine cork"" which would have been cute but my date who it was for, does not drink ! The birthday candle was served on the desert which was a molten chocolate cake which was dry. Something I have never experienced with this
desert. Overall I felt like I was eating ""day old"" food. These people have no clue what a ""high end"" meal should taste like. Its more of something that would be served to a  tour group !! who don't know any better !!!  IF anyone suggests this place...... run the other way.",0
"Second time my wife and I went for our Anniversary. We were married at Casa Loma and had our reception there, it‚Äôs great to go back every year and remember as well as the excitement of having a fabulous meal in such a great location. Stellar food and service with ambience that cannot be matched anywhere",3
Spectacular restaurant! Exceptional service! Sommelier is very educated! Will definitely be returning!,4
"First time dining at the restaurant and the food and service was top notch. Dax, Garth and Jonathan‚Äôs customer service was wonderful. 

We will return for dinner with the kids!",4
"Love the amazing food, service & total experience!!! Would definitely come back soon!!",4
"Great dining experience. The staff made an effort to make the birthday celebration special, from the card, candle, and present. The manager also gave a short tour of the main hall and gave a brief explanation of the Christmas holiday decorations. Wonderful dining experience, will definitely go back again.",4
This restaurant is Simply Amazing the service the staff the atmosphere the food everything was excellent,4
"This place is amazing. I had such a wonderful time here. The staff pays attention to details a lot and the customer service is out of this world. There is always someone checking up on our table to make sure if we need refills, if we liked our food, if we were okay. The food is very rich. I have never ever been to a restaurant where I felt like a queen. Blue blood steakhouse should be the examples of other restaurants .",4
We waited along to have our order taken and had to ask someone to get our waiter.  Caesar salad was delicious.  Steak had a lot of grissel on it for a 90. Rib eye steak.  And was hard to cut.  Nobody cane over after we received our mail course to see if steak was cooked properly as they do at other good steak houses.  The Resturant was very loud and noisy and hard to hear each other talk.,3
BlueBlood steak house was very good. The atmosphere was magical as it was decorated for Christmas. We enjoyed the food and the ambiance. The lighting was somewhat dark though and I would have appreciated more lighting. Also the menu could have been written in a larger font as it was difficult to read.,3
"Food and location was good. Server dropped butter, and spilled oil on wife's outfit. Then offer a fifty dollar gift certificate, on a $1000.00 dinner. Not something I would except from this location. Also offered dry cleaning. I work for Mercedes-Benz Canada, if a customer experienced something like this , there would be no charge for what ever the incident. And would offer more to make them happy and to retain them as a customer for life. I am the factory representative for Canada.",0
"The food is fabulous, but the staff are exemplary. The Liberty group must be congratulated on bringing this building to life. Five star dining at it‚Äôs best. Blue Blood and the castle itself are a jewel in the city‚Äôs crown.",4
"Excellent experience, never felt rushed with anything, and never waited long for anything when clearly ready for the next stage. Excellent food, well waited upon, very very enjoyable atmosphere.",4
"The food was good, but not over the top for the price. Service was superb, attentive but not in your face. Dessert was spectacular, we had the Baked Alaska fired up at the table, and a real joy to watch. The castle is beautifully decorated for Christmas, both inside & out. My only real criticism was the noise level. The tables are wide and one had to lean across to hear the company seated opposite to make oneself heard. Still worth trying out for the overall experience.",3
It was beautiful & the staff were awesome & so knowledgeable!,4
"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday, the food was amazing, they were also very attentive to us and always checked . He also received a nice gift from them for his birthday . Would definitely go back there !",4
"This is the second time visiting this restaurant and plan to enjoy it many more times in years to come.  It's quite pricey but the food, ambiance, service and portion size amply justify the amount.",4
"Visited Canada for honeymoon right after our wedding and we dined at BlueBlood to celebrate the whole occasion - it was the best decision made! No regrets for the steep pricing. The ambience, quality of food and service was remarkable. Would definitely return again for any special celebration. 

The picturesque place looks magnificent even at 7pm after the sun sets.",4
"Very well put together, the vibe was relaxing and had a nice humble setting. Service exceeded my expectations and was top of the line, felt very welcoming. 10/10 would recommend.",4
"The ambiance was just amazing. We loved it. The Service the presentation was spectacle. So nice of them to present the salad and dessert. They knew exactly what they were doing. The place is beautiful and the food was delicious.
We had a wonderful time.",4
Delicious food in a stunning space.  Perfect for a one-in-a-blue-moon special romantic fancy date night!,4
"Having dinner at Casa Loma is reason enough to go.  Unfortunately, my $65.00 medium rare steak came out completely raw... Other then that, everything else was good.  Would give you guys a second chance, just to go back to Casa Loma.",3
"Mediocre, overpriced with pretty poor steak. Wrote a constructive email to the restaurant but they couldn‚Äôt be bothered to respond. Avoid this place.",2
Had a very good meal and amazing atmosphere! We enjoyed the dry aged tomahawk steak and had about 5 different side dishes that were all very good. Service was attentive and helpful. Ceasar salad done table side was great! We toured the castle after dinner! Would definitely go back!,3
This was the second time I went. The food and service surpassed my first visit by far. I'm so excited to go back!,4
Service was amazing and food was astonishing! Everything was set perfectly and we were asked if everything was set to our expectations.,4
Service and venue were wonderful! Our server Conor did an amazing job ‚ù§Ô∏è thank you!!!! We will be back!,4
"Overall experience was very good . Staff was very polite , respectful. Meals were amazing . I recommend this restaurant .",4
AMAZING! Steak was perfect and the food was top notch ! Well worth the $,4
Food was not worth the cost.  Ruth Chris much better,2
Best waygu steak I‚Äôve ever eaten in my life but very expensive!!,4
"Booked this reservation well in advance and requested to be sat in the traditional side of the restaurant as we were celebrating a birthday and visiting from out of town. This was confirmed again when the host called a week prior.  When we got there, we were tucked in the corner next to the fire place in the middle seating area so did not get the traditional side or the newer bar lounge area.  It was still fine but given how early we booked the reservation it was disappointing.  Food was fine although there was an error made with one of the dishes (no cheese requested) which they ended up taking off the bull. It was cool being able to walk around casa loma afterwards.  Would recommend trying it once...likely wont be back.",2
"if you have a steak at any restaurant it all tastes the same and is better when you cook it yourswlf. lobster mac and cheese is very liquidy... table side cesar salad killed the whole night, the raw garlic that was used was horrible would not recommend it at all as both your stomach and anyone around you will feel the effect for a day",0
"Experience was wonderful, thank for hosting us
We loved the ambience",4
Too-notch. Unforgettable,4
"It was an excellent service. The Cad Rib Eye was amazing and the Baked Alaska preparation was like a magical show. Overall, a perfect setting for the occasion.",4
"Just a hint that you can share a salad, it was huge !",4
"Oak room amusing and pretty at the same time.  lSides not all that flavourfu (asparagus, not at all ""buttery"";  fries were too big, and a little too soft;  gorgonzola on the gnocchi needed to be toned down significantly -- all in all, not a deft touch on the vegetables), but meat was above average and well cooked, though not excellent.   Excellent choice of local suppliers of meat., however.   Ipad used for alcohol list, which is not very nice, actually.  It's quite jarring.  Staff pleasant, but service is somewhat disorganized, and staff had to leave to get answers to basic questions on more than one occasion, i.e., to answers like:  Is that meat finished with corn.  That's not their fault, its the fault of the owners.",3
"It‚Äôs my girlfriends birthday and I made a reservation with a note saying I prefer I table besides the window. Finally we are seated in two small sofa in a very tiny corner. The table is too small that our steaks are put into one plate. (We also order the seafood tower) We were ready to order but the waiter was pretty busy and I have to ask him 3 times finally he came to take out order. But he was busy with other customers, not even taking a look at us. Basically the response was slow. Other people are nice to us but feel like the waiter who covered our table doesn‚Äôt like us. Both of us feel the bias because we are not native English speaker or we are Asian.",0
"Yes! Totally, my wife and I are meat-lovers, so I decided to take her to this steakhouse for her birthday, and it didn't disappoint. It's a pretty luxurious experience and the food is on par with the scenery.

Would definitely recommend for special occasions, or if you want to impress someone.",4
Nice atmosphere and great services!!!,4
"Beautiful place with nice atmosphere. Food was ok, service was nice. Too expensive",3
"Omg. This place is phenomenal! Every single element was superb! Our waiter, Chris, was on top of every single detail and we wanted for absolutly nothing our entire experience. The ambiance of the Castle, the cuts of steak! Everything was perfect.",4
The service was good when we arrived (6:30-6:45) but it dragged at the end. We didn't get out until 10:00 pm. Other tables that came after us with 3 people were done way ahead of us. My daughter ordered the platter of sweets and one of the macarons had the shell (bottom - not visible on top) completely cracked off and it was extremely hard.  The duck fat fries were not great. I did not get the crunchy texture and taste that duck fat should give to a potato. Overall I really don't think the quality of the food was worth the price. Thank you.,2
"We had an amazing experience dining in Casa Loma at the BlueBlood Steakhouse!! From the moment we arrived, we knew that we were in for an astonishingly first class evening! Everything was...PERFECT! üíúüç∏",4
"wonderful ambiance, great wine and app list.
steaks where all perfect (not the biggest fan of the lamb chops) but everything else was aces!
the cheesecake is to die for!",4
Just as I expected it to be. Top notch Di Donato Quality,4
"My experience at BlueBlood Steakhouse was extraordinary.  The service was exceptional, the food was fantastic and the ambiance was perfect.  It was what I would expect while having dinner in a castle, I felt like royalty.   I had the filet steak from PEI and it was a perfect medium rare.  The asparagus had a wonderful cheese topping which enhanced the flavour of the aspargus very nicely.   We also had the caramelized onions with bacon and that dish was delicious, it was a great accompaniment to our steak.",4
"Very inexperienced server, brought out the wrong cut of steak, then proceeded to try and convince us that a ribeye was in fact a filet.",1
"Celebrated daughter‚Äôs 19th. Great bar ambiance to do so. ‚ÄúDavy‚Äù was a great bartender for our daughter‚Äôs first real legal drink!  Meal great, service excellent as one would hope at a restaurant of this caliber. Only negative comments - mashed potato dish ü§î bathroom trek a little extreme.  Not a ton of vegetarian options but knew this from the outset.",4
Nothing special for the food at that price. Absolutely beautiful restaurant and ambiance. Food was nothing to rave about.,2
Friends visiting from out of town celebrating their birthday. We got a gift and an amazing tour with a very knowledgeable manager. It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äòdinner‚Äô it was an ‚Äòexperience‚Äô,4
"I've eaten at the best steakhouses in Toronto, New York and Chicago. BlueBlood is a decent steakhouse but it is horribly overpriced for what it offers. When I asked for butter for the overcooked lobster they brought the type of butter you get on your popcorn at cineplex, AND they charged me for it.

Like I said, it is a nice place with a great atmosphere and attentive staff. But try not to spend much money as the food is quite bad and you'll likely regret it.",2
Amazing anniversary experience! Wish we could go back every year‚Äô,4
"Amazing Amazing Amazing 
First Class all the way 
One of the only restaurant to truly give me the WOW Factor in a very long time 
Excellent service and the presentation was outstanding 
The seafood tower was fresh and perfectly prepared (de-shelled), and the smoked scallops were remarkable, the portions are large so bring your appetite. 
The desert menu is equally terrific, so much so I ordered a extra dessert to go 
Absolutely can not wait to go back, this restaurant should be on everyone‚Äôs bucket list, it will not disappoint",4
"Exceptional atmosphere, food and service . Great place for any sort of event , or gathering. Drinks are amazing!",4
"Great food, great service from wait staff, hostess was a little judgey as we may not wear the part as well as some we like what we like not trying to pretend we‚Äôre something else. But amazing steaks and our waiter and other servers were fantastic",3
I love it there great service great food pricey but worth it,4
"Everything was great, food service and hospitality",4
We had an amazing experience at BlueBlood and the service was exceptional.,4
Great food and service. Ambience was also amazing.,4
Best place for a nice date. Food was perfect and Connor was really welcoming. 100% coming back!!,4
"Amazing service! 

Ask for Trevor the server.  The tall manager who was on duty was a great guy.",4
"I have been to BB twice before and I had experiences worth raving about. I was so excited to be having my convocation dinner there, but sadly this time was a far cry from the others. First, I called 3 weeks in advance to increase my reservation to 5 people (instead of 4) and was told the restaurant was booked full. Yet, when I arrived the table had been set for 5 (too late for that!). Then the service was extremely slow and the server kept suggesting I order a different quantity of food than what I asked for. The final straw was when the two porterhouse steaks arrived at the table, there was an immediate stench of meat on the verge of going bad, if not bad already. This visit was a huge disappointment and given the price point I don‚Äôt think I will be returning to BB.",1
"Superb! 
The only thing is that they did not accommodate was the room / table request. But they made up for it!",4
"The staff was extremely welcoming, they ambiance was outstanding. You cannot put the experience into words, the steak was cooked to perfection. Coming from a small town I was not sure how we would fit into the higher class vibe but we did not feel uncomfortable at all. Our waitress was phenomenal and I recommend that everyone eat here at least once as a bucket list item.",4
Good food absolutely Amazing  service .,4
This place was amazing. The perfect setting to take my boyfriend out for his 40th birthday. The food was unreal and the staff were so lovely. Highly recommend!,4
Amazing experience. A bit on the expensive side but its class all the way. Staff are inccredible and you are treated like royalty. Thank you for an incredible  anniversary.,4
Phenomenal food and great atmosphere!,4
"Amazing food, definitely worth it. Its located in beautiful Casa Loma, it doesn't get better than that.",4
Awesome as always,4
"Loved the service, probably the best I have ever had.

Ambiance was amazing.

Will definitely make this our spot for our future anniversaries.",4
"I am grateful for the amazing experience. We got a little tour after dinner from one of the managers. As well we got a complementary VIP entrance to the Halloween event via the tunnel. However, I must say the steak (wagyu rib eye) was cooked perfectly medium rare throughout. Every bite was soft and succulent. I'll definitely be visiting BlueBlood again sometime in the near future.",4
"Ample parking at Casa Loma - $15/self parking & $20/valet.
From the moment we walked into Blue Blood, we were welcomed by the several hostesses.  It was a warm welcome and that was carried throughout the night.
Our meals were perfect - we ordered the foie gras, seafood tower, french onion soup, dry aged porterhouse, and a barrel cut filet.  This was enough to feed our group of 6.  They also offered complimentary bread, which was a nice touch.
The sommelier was also very helpful with her wine suggestions, and took note of our preferences to complement our meal.  
Our server was attentive, and answered all our questions without hesitation.  
Since our meal was for a celebration, the restaurant was generous in giving us a small token and a hand written note to congratulate our special occasion.  This was very much appreciated.
Blue Blood exceeded our expectation with the level of service and their quality of food.  We will return again when we have another special occassion to celebrate.",4
Waiter Conner excellent,4
"One of my favourite restaurants for its service quality and it‚Äôs ambience. I adore how it‚Äôs decorated, and it‚Äôs service staff are top notch! Seated quickly, attentive the entire meal and very personable. The in-house sourdough bread lacked salt but is nicely presented. Started with the wedge salad and was very impressed with its amazing balance of flavours and textures. Highly recommend. Also had the beet cured salmon and couldn‚Äôt have been happier with its presentation, taste and textures. I usually always have the tomahawk steak and this time it wasn‚Äôt very evenly cooked, and had a large majority of gristle/fat to it which had me regretting choosing it over the porterhouse. It was disappointing. Paired it with the mashed potatoes, which I love because they are very simple and simply done very well. Also had a side of mushrooms (to die for!) and the cream spinach which is an interesting take on the traditional preparation of creamed spinach...I loved it, my hubby hated it. I always end with their fabulous espresso and this time had the apple pie-seriously one of the best I‚Äôve ever had!! They were aware it was our anniversary and it was very sweet when they presented us with a gift as they served our dessert! A wonderful night and great spot to celebrate!",3
Proposed to my wife to be! Krystal was are waitress and she was awesome! Everyone treated us special on our special occasions!,4
"Absolutely great place with outstanding service and excellent food and wines collection. The only thing we missed some floor space and a music to dance, and no... no rap or that sort of music... something like waltz or tango, or rumba... why not? 
Toronto is quite poor for offering of this type of entertainment.  At the end it is a castle with a lot of space to offer... :-)",4
Food was outstanding. Setting is beautiful. Definitely worth a try.,3
We came here for my husband‚Äôs birthday and it was the best choice we could have made. Everyone in the group loved the food and the ambiance. Presentation of the dessert we ordered (merengue) was spectacular too.,4
"So overpriced, old fashion food really below averadge",0
"The most fancy meal we will ever have.  So good amazing restaurant we will never forget that night. 

Thank you",4
"We celebrated our 40th anniversary Oct 12th.
Having been married at Casa Loma it was a treat to be back. The service was amazing , the food top notch At the end of our meal we where presented with a gift and a card from them. Thank you for a memorable evening.",4
"Took my mom out for a Birthday dinner and I must say , as per usual they don‚Äôt disappoint. The tuna tartar and oysters were great and the steaks are amazing ! Thanks for yet another memorable night.",4
"I‚Äôm a pretty big guy told the server then manager I would like to switch, they put us at the exact same table on the other side of the room.   Food was decent service was not good at all. I believe there are much better options in the city for a proper steakhouse.",2
"best caesar salad in the city (but you gotta like garlic and anchovies); seafood tower is great.
dining here is an experience from the moment you drive up to casa loma, the dining room is spectacular and the service is always on cue.  Will definately be going back to share our families special occasions.",4
We had a Great time ! Exceptional staff!,4
"The service was amazing!  The restaurant is spectacular!  I was warned on how hot the French Onion soup is, the bowl was steaming but the soup was cold, same with the filet. Every side we had was not prepared well. The service was amazing, the staff was incredible. The ambiance was dynamic. Food was extremely disappointing.",1
"OMG this location was wonderful. I had my birthday dinner here and it is connected to the CASA LOMA.  Conner was phenomenal, the food was divine, and the location was beyond amazing. The food and drink selection was very broad. I enjoyed every part of this location. Very nice portions and the cheesecake was seriously delicious. They even give you a small token for dinner which I enjoyed with my husband. Next time I travel to CA we will def indulge this location.",4
"The food was absolutely fantastic, the service was impeccable, and the restaurant was stunning. A restaurant in a castle was the best idea anyone could have had.",4
Excellent service ! Great customer service .. the ambiance is stunning !! Food is value for money and the taste is good as well !!!! Definitely recommend,4
"We had an amazing evening! The staff and management were incredible! The haunted house was so scary and so well done, I can‚Äôt wait to return!",4
The level of service was outstanding. My husband and I tried a different steak each. Both were wonderful. Our son had the salmon and thought it was very tasty. They have a table side Caesar salad that is fun to watch and absolutely delicious. The Caesar salad for 2 was sufficient for all 3 of us. We are planning to go again next week with friends. I didn't enjoy the wines they had by the glass so next time we will be bringing our own wine and pay the corking fee.,4
"Great steaks!  But the sides and appetizers, with the exception of the caesars salad, was underwhelming.",3
"Service was attentive, food was delicious, ambiance and setting is fantastic",4
It was great and the food was amazing! The server comes back frequently to check on our meal and if there is anything else we need. It was a great experience!,3
"Had a fun night out with friends.  Casa loma made the night memorable.  The steaks were cooked perfectly, wine list is extensive",4
Over all a great experience but would of preferred it quieter,4
"My husband and I came to BlueBlood Steakhouse with reservations and we received the seats I requested (by the large window near the bar). The view was lovely. The staff provided just the right amount of attentiveness and we had an interesting, brief conversation with our server.

The food exceeded our expectations. We ordered the braised short ribs (recommended by our server) and the charbroiled European sea bass. The short ribs were fall-off-the-bone goodness (the best we've had) with very generous portions and perfectly seasoned/salted. Often restaurants tend to over-salt or over-sweeten their ribs, but not here! We were also served a whole sea bass! Most restaurants tend to serve just a modest fillet/piece. They used fresh ingredients and did not over season...the let the freshness speak for itself. Both dishes are shareable...enough to feed 3 people. We were highly impressed by the quality of the food, ambience/d√©cor (relaxed, elegant, chic), comfortable seating and friendly service. The kitchen also kindly allowed us to cancel an extra dish we ordered, because the first two dishes filled us up...how often could you say that about fine dining?!

The staff also added a nice touch to our celebration with complimentary dark chocolates and a momento for our anniversary, a wine cork topped with a metal embossed image of Casa Loma. We were too full to order dessert, but we definitely want to return to try more of their dishes!",4
"Craig and the entire staff at BlueBlood made our evening and dinner at Casa Loma an absolutely fantastic experience. As you know from the location, the ambiance is amazing. It is cozy enough to enjoy dinner as a couple, but not so big that you're dealing with large groups dominating the atmosphere. The serving staff was extremely attentive, as were the managers - which is a nice touch beyond great staff. the food was spectacular from the first bite. The steaks were done exactly as we requested, the side dishes were plentiful and easily shared between two (could've shared by three) people. Food was served hot, except the beefsteak tomatoes, and the dessert we selected was very flavorful and plenty for two (the Artisan trio). We live in Nashville and have a few good steakhouses here, but BlueBlood delivers on both the food and the experience inside the castle. We highly recommend it, especially for romantic or special occasions. SIDE NOTE - We were also treated to the Legends of Horror haunted house on the grounds after dinner, which was a lot of fun. BlueBlood provided a complete, and memorable experience well worth the price!",4
My friend found a beetle in her salmon dish. They apologized and gave her meal to her for free but we had to ask if they‚Äôd also cover her coke. Seemed their response to the incident  was minimal compared to the enormity of the problem.  Such a surprise at an otherwise beautiful place. So unexpected.,0
"Environment were good
Service was great
However, disappointed of no one had contacted me that I left my powerbank on the chair by our table....",2
The food tasted very good. However there must have been something very bad because I was in the washroom all day the day after our visit. Also I feel it was over priced.,0
Great atmosphere and the service was amazing and food was exceptional.,4
"We went to BlueBlood Steakhouse to celebrate my birthday. The food and service were excellent and we felt the ambience was perfect for the occasion. Although a bit pricey for our everyday dining, this will definitely be on our short list for anniversaries and other milestone celebrations.",4
Great food and environment!,4
Amazing experience although,4
"Officially my favourite restaurant in Toronto! Astounding service and the food was to die for - absolutely perfect! I went to celebrate my birthday and everything was exceptional the steak was melt in your mouth soft and cooked to perfection, lobster was succulent and meaty, side dishes were impressively  big enough portions to share and delicious will be coming again when I can :D",4
"Love, love, love this place, food is superb! thank you so much",4
"Service is exemplary. Food id excellent. The atmosphere is stunning, especially for the fact Blueblood is in Casa Loma. Just an overall great experience.",4
"The dinner was better than expected. Amazing ambiance of being inside the most spectacular building in Toronto helps the total ambiance of the room. The apps that were suggested were excellent, Wagu beef and tuna carpaccio was perfectly seasoned and very tasty.

The wind that the Somali I selected was definitely worth going off the normal trend of well-known wines where he selected a vintage from 2009 from a California region I‚Äôve never heard before. It was good value and excellent in body and stature.

The meat was perfectly cooked and some of the best tasting steaks I‚Äôve had in a while.

I would definitely recommend This restaurant for a great steak dinner with a great atmosphere to enjoy the meal in.",4
Great high class steaks and a warm service. Good place to dine in a special atmosphere.,4
"Ambiance was amazing, friendly staff. My steak however was not cooked the way I ordered it unfortunately, tainting the experience. It was a very expensive streak and the reason we attending the restaurant. I was too shy to complain to the waiter and therefore had to eat the steak as served",2
"Le restaurant est magnifique et le service exceptionnel. Le prix est un peu √©lev√© pour l'exp√©rience offerte. La qualit√© est l√† c'est certain mais aucune saveur qui nous fait tomber par terre...  Le steak de mon conjoint √©tait excellent, les champignons baignaient dans l'eau de la cassolette, le short rib manquait terriblement d'assaisonnement.",2
Simply amazing,4
"Excellent food, but Casa Loma is still a place for tourists & weddings. The service was outstanding. The place is simply out of (our) budget: 4 glasses of wine, 3 mains, 4 sides, 2 deserts, 2 coffees, 2 digestives = $700 incl. tip! Dunno, maybe people find this ok. Unfortunately, the ""terrace"" is just for weddings",3
"Really nice dinner. Staff was extremely polite and accommodating. Food was brought out promptly and cooked to our liking. Portions are really big, so keep that in mind when ordering appetizers and sides. One side is enough for two. Price is a little steeper than other steakhouses, but, the ambiance, food and service makes up for it. I will return.",3
"Amazing food and the service was fantastic. Loved the look and feel of the room.
Wonderful spot for a special occasion/celebration.",4
"We had our 6th Anniversary dinner at Blueblood, our 1st time there. The experience was one of the best we have had at any restaurant!! The food is absolutely top notch, the servings were so generous it was almost overwhelming and very much worth every cent paid!! Have never had service as attentive without being  intrusive. All the staff, from being greeted before we even entered the restaurant, hostess showing us to our table, food runners, professional servers, and engaged management - that in itself makes Blueblood way above all the other high end restaurants!! The staff all wished us a happy anniversary, and then we received a card and gift from the staff. This was the very first time the occassion listed in Open Table reservations was actually noted and made aware to all the staff. Thank you very much to everyone at Blueblood making our 6th Anniversary dinner the best ever!! It is a must for all foodies to dine at!!",4
"Only comment is the chairs at table for two are terribly uncomfortable!!!!  I‚Äôm not sure who would them comfortable - sitting at an awkward angle for 90 minutes!

Everything else was excellent",4
"Brought my dad here for his birthday. It was magical. I had my 2 year old with me, and the waitress was very considerate of my child. At the end my dad also got a really cool gift from them. Thank you so much Blue Blood !",4
"Very beautiful place and relaxing as well. I had the scallops and they were amazing! They were so good and the presentation was beautiful! Our waitress was really good, polite and very friendly and attentive.",4
it was amazing!! its worth what we paid for. be back next time..,4
"Had pretty high expectations after reading reviews but was a bit disappointed overall, especially comparing against others like harbour 60. The sommelier brought the wrong wine, the waiter wasn't able to explain the differences between specific cuts and we had to flag down someone to place our order. The food was good, but at prices comparable to other high end steak houses in Toronto, I'd likely not go back.",2
"Atmosphere was nice. Service was great. For the money, food was nothing special. Edible, but definitely not worth the price.",2
Beautiful place. Great food and at the end of your meal they offer you a little square of chocolate that is to die for. We actually took a picture of the box that it was served in to remember the name. When we left we googled the little chocolatier tucked away on a small street next door to a coffee place. We purchased chocolates to go and had coffee at the shop!,4
"The food was top notch as one would expect from a high end steak house like this one. Service was great, cocktails were amazing. Place ain‚Äôt cheap but it‚Äôs worth every penny.",4
"We haven‚Äôt made it to the castle in years and decided to go check out Blue Blood for a nice dinner and some wine.  From the smiles at the door, to the cocktails, ambiance, service, and steaks, we were blown away. Craig the manager offered to take us on a tour of the castle after dessert.  That was a game changer for us. It‚Äôs a beautiful restaurant and the service was excellent. We will definitely be back.",4
Just fantastic!,4
"Exceptional service and the food was beyond expectations.

Compliments to the chef and to all the serving staff , especially Sergio our Host who did an amazing job.",4
"Worst dining experience I‚Äôve had in a VERY long time. Sat at 815. By 10:30 still no food. No apologies from waitress or even explanation. 150 dollar bottle of wine sitting opened on the table waiting for our steaks. The place was empty with other servers clearing place settings from the empty tables. My extremely calm husband finally called it and asked them to just bring our cheque. 10 minutes later the waitress drops it.......and I‚Äôm like can you please have your manager come over and speak to us at least?! She came and offered us a free dessert. I‚Äôm like I do not want a dessert; I wanted a medium rare 5 oz $200 steak that for some reason is taking more than 1.5 hrs to prepare (obviously I didn‚Äôt say that but I hate myself for having to sit there and be polite when she could care less that not only was our anniversary dinner ruined, not only did we come the 3 hrs to Toronto to celebrate there but by 11 pm on Sunday evening there was nothing else open. So $300 dollars wasted and I had the pleasure of going to bed hungry. ) 

Wouldn‚Äôt expect this kind of experience at ANY dining establishment; but even more shocking from 5* place where we would be dropping over $700 on a single dinner. So yeah, great night, thanks.",0
Only complaint is paying $15 for parking,4
"PARKING PARKING PARKING.... Its really bad that I have to pay $15 for parking in a place that has abundant amount of parking, and they can't even cover the cost of peoples parking that come there to eat. they should do a deal with with castle owners to cover parking for clients. we are coming there to spend a lot of money and the valet was even closed at 9.30 pm...",2
"We went to BlueBlood for our recent anniversary dinner.   We had steak, lamb rack, garlic mashed, broccolini and the caesar salad made at the table.  The food and service was good, but  just not quite to the level I would expect for the price point.  The location is lovely for a special occasion.",3
Totally enjoyable,4
"Beautiful atmosphere, great service, delicious large serving of food.",4
"THE SETTING AT BLUEBLOOD CANNOT BE BEAT. THE SERVICE AS WELL WAS EXEMPLARY.
UNFORTUNATELY. THE FOOD, IN PARTICULAR THE STEAKS, DID NOT COME CLOSE TO THOSE LOFTY LEVELS. MY FRIEND AND I TRIED BOTH A RIB STEAK AND A STRIPLOIN, AND THEY WERE BOTH EXTREMELY TOUGH AND CHEWY. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE PRICES CHARGED. THEIR WINE LIST WAS DISAPPOINTING AS WELL. THERE ARE VERY FEW BOTTLES OFFERED IN THE $100 RANGE, THE VAST MAJORITY BEING $200 AND MORE.  OBVIOUSLY THEY CAN CHOOSE WHATEVER WINES THEY DEEM APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR MENU. I SIMPLY BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS WINES OUT THERE FOR AROUND $100 THAT ARE EXCELLENT.
THERE ARE ALSO NUMEROUS STEAKHOUSES IN TORONTO THAT OFFER FAR SUPERIOR STEAKS AT MUCH MORE REASONABLE PRICES.",2
"Food is pretty meh, it‚Äôs worth it just for the opportunity to walk the castle alone at night when it‚Äôs not crowded.",3
"Amazing Location, great ambiance.  King crab was pre-prepared so not as freshly served ""out of the pot"".  Steaks were excellent but no better than Keg and not as good as Octagon.  Tried 3 sampler WAGU steak for table, Australian amazing, others were OK, I think chef overcooked.  Not worth $250.  At the price definitely better places.  Service was very slow.",1
"SETTING IS BEAUTIFUL.  SERVICE WAS FINE, BUT NOT UP TO THE LEVEL I WOULD EXPECT FOR THOSE PRICES.  STEAK WAS NOT SUPER HOT AND THE GARLIC MASHED POTATOES WERE AVERAGE AT BEST.  WE GOT THE SEAFOOD TOWER FOR 2 AND WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED WITH IT. 
 WE WENT FOR MY WIFE'S 50TH BIRTHDAY AND IT WAS NICE OF THEM TO GIVE HER A LITTLE GIFT FOR THAT.  WE BOTH HAD AN ISSUE WITH $20 TO PARK.  I CAN SEE IF YOU ARE JUST GOING TO THE CASTLE TO WALK AROUND THE GROUNDS, BUT IS YOU HAVE A RESERVATION AND ARE PAYING THOSE PRICES, PARKING SHOULD BE COMPLIMENTARY.  WOULD NOT DISCOURAGE FRIENDS FROM GOING, JUST WOULD RELAY OUR EXPERIENCE THERE AND LET THEM DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES",2
Outstanding!,4
Vacation visit to Casa Loma. Wanted the entire experience of the Castle,4
"We have been several times to BlueBlood, it's been better, the last two times the we were not impressed, the Salads came wrong and had to go back, the steak was under cooked and needed to go back, the crabcakes were over cooked, the asparagus was drenched in balsamic vinegar and the mashed potatoes had no taste.  For the price they need to step up their game, we wont be going back any time soon!!",2
"We eat out often and enjoy fine dining.  Blueblood ‚Äòtis at the top and steals the show with ambiance, style and presentation!  This swanky restaurant has it all from decor, hand crafted cocktails and a menu that will leave beyond pleased!",4
"Very pricey and small portion sizes
Water was also very pricey",2
Absolutely incredible experience!! The food and service were exceptional!! Unbelievable place with so much history! Thank you so much for giving us such a memorable experience BlueBlood TEAM!!!,4
What a beautiful venue - the service was amazing and the food was fantastic.,4
"Service was very good, very knowledgeable staff.  Managers introduced themselves at our table. 
Very good experience overall, will be back!",4
"Ambience was beautiful We sat outside on a pleasant August night with a view of the city Service was fabulous. We ordered salad and rib eye, polenta squares, cheesecake for dessert.  Sadly, the Malbec was off, didn‚Äôt taste quite right  and we are regular Malbec drinkers so believe me we know.  Rib eye was tuff and chewy Polenta squares were definitely not what I expected. They seemed stale  Cheesecake was good but not great. I‚Äôve had better.  If the gardens and the ambience wasn‚Äôt so stunning the evening would‚Äôve been a bust.",3
"Thank you, Davide, for an outstanding evening! My dad has very special needs and you have done such wonderful job to make him comfortable and at ease. You have really made our, very rare outing, very special. Food was superb as well, ambiance just lovely, but Davide‚Äôs service was above all. Truly truly thank you!!",4
Amazing steak,4
"Great food and service, can‚Äôt beat the view on the patio best in the city",4
"Thanks for your anniversary gift. My wife really love it. 
Best wishes. Thank you very much.",4
Beautiful restaurant and staff were wonderful.  Very pricey and bottle of wine is overpriced.  Bread was a bit stale.  Cornish hen was excellent but my sea bass was quite bland.,3
We dined on the gorgeous patio listened to Symphony in the gardens opera diva night which couldn't of been any better.  Food was delish with large portions with impeccable service.,4
We took a friend from Arizona for a special dinner. That is exactly what we got. He couldn‚Äôt stop complimenting the food and presentation. Our waiter was excellent. Very knowledgeable and very courteous.  This was my third visit and I hope to have many many more!,4
Enjoyable beginning to end!,4
"The food was really not good, especially for the price point. The waitress was oddly confused when I asked for a side salad instead of fries.",1
Amazing food and even better service! Restaurant was nicely decorated too,4
"Beautiful restaurant, amazing service! Highly recommend!",4
Fantastic experience! Ask about the history of the wine cellar. The history and ambiance is almost as good as the steak,4
"Food , service and surroundings excellent. Prices high, but steaks are better than most steak restaurants in Toronto. Limited selection of wines by the glass, and super expensive for amount of wine in glass served, doesn‚Äôt fit with the otherwise generous portions of everything else.",4
"Truly impressive setting... the renovations to Casa Loma for this restaurant and lounge will leave you impressed.  The food is beautifully prepared and this steakhouse is on par price wise and quality with the great steakhouses in Toronto (Hys, H60, Barbarians, Jacobs).",4
Wonderful food ambience and service,4
"Location makes parking difficult. But dining in the castle is definitely a very special experience. Service is good, but doesn't really stand out from other higher end restaurants. Food is good, steak is cooked perfectly, and the Japanese Wagyu Fillet Mignon is superb. However, the steak and even the side dishes are a bit too salty for us.",2
"Excellent from start to finish.  Incredible staff, wonderful food and ambiance was perfect.  Great place for a birthday celebration.",4
"I was seated in the bar area this time, not as nice as in the Oak Room so I took away 1 star for ambiance. Food was fantastic - loved the Cesar salad made fresh by our table side. Steak was cooked to perfection.",3
Beautiful venue however the steak itself was good but I don't believe worth the price tag.,4
"We had a great visit to the terrace and although there was a torrential downpour, the staff were exceptionally accommodating moving us initially into the sun, then away from possible rainfall all the while delivering fantastic food and wine.  Highly recommend it!",4
Prefect birthday experiences in the blublood statehouse,4
"Great restaurant!  Food and service was fantastic!  Our server Davide was very knowledgeable on the different cuts of steak.  Only critique of this restaurant, is the washroom is in Casa Loma not the restaurant.",4
"I took my girlfriend for our 3 Year Anyversary and we had one of a kind experience, food is fabulous, service is impecable. 

We also got to walk around the Castle and it has a beautiful view. 

This place worth every penny!!!",4
"We came to BlueBlood for my birthday and got the oysters to start which are probably the best oysters I‚Äôve had in a long time. The Bone in Rib eye was done to perfection.  It was tender, juicy, and flavorful without being over-seasoned. The waiters were knowledgeable and witty which made for great banter, and we even got a tour of the castle which was a great added touch to the end of the night. Definitely would dine here again.",4
One of Toronto‚Äôs beat!!,4
I have - see my ratings.,2
"The 16oz ribeye was the most delicious steak I‚Äôve ever had and it was cooked spot on medium. Tom and the other waiters were extremely attentive, friendly, helpful and made my experience a thousand times better. Very beautiful and cozy interior. I recommend giving this place a shot as you will be amazed.",4
"I took my best girlfriend and her husband here on Wednesday this week - it was his birthday and we just felt like celebrating.  From the moment we arrived everyone was very welcoming and treated us like royalty.  Dex was our server and he was top notch.  The food itself was amazing, best crab cakes I've had in a long time.  The Tomahawk Steak - my friend's husband was not leaving without having it so we decided to share and the Baked Alaska???? what can I say, it was an amazing evening and we would like to thank everyone from the Bartenders who served us before we had dinner and everyone else.  Can't wait to come back but No Tomahawk for me! I don't want to have to roll myself out of BlueBlood next time.
Thank you everyone for making his birthday one to remember.
Yvonne Sharma",4
"Everything was absolutely beautiful. The only minor note is possible because we were eating on the patio our main dish did arrive lukewarm almost cold but delicious nonetheless! Something to note but not factor in as taking away from the food quality, venue, ambiance and service. It was outstanding.",4
Fabulous inside & out. Great portion & dining is an experience. Crafted cocktails and delicious dishes. Sat on the new patio while listening to Symphony in the gardens.,4
Overpriced!!! Seating is not very comfortable. Overpriced!,3
"We sat on the terrace which was so nice in the fading sunshine.
It is pretty and really the best place to sit.
However...........
You are still paying full price for the same food albeit,not as full a menu but they do not bring you bread and butter,no truffle oil and we had to ask for the salts.
Service was very slow.
The steak could have been much warmer.
The staff was nosily laughing and one was sweeping right at our feet as we were eating !!!
We also ended up with stomach problems after dinner.",3
"The ambiance and the decor is amazing. People working there are so professional and welcoming. The salad was so tasty. The main dish, which was sea food tower, was tasteless. With all confident, I would say that sea food dish was worst sea food dish I have ever had. Probably it was a mistake to go to a stakehouse restaurant and order sea food lol.",2
They are a steakhouse and they should get the steak right. Mine was really overdone and they offered to exchange it but I ran out of time because I had to be at a concert. However they did give me something else so they tried hard to correct the mistake. The service was excellent as was the bread and the Caesar salad. The asparagus was nothing special and overpriced,2
Excelentr comida e instalaciones de ensue√±o,4
Delicious. I recommend this for a special occasion!,4
Chubliano (Dax) was the best waiter we‚Äôve had at a restaurant in a long time. He gave us some great suggestions and made us laugh too. Tatiana also gave us a great tour after our meal which made the night even more special. Thanks to both of them!,4
Disappointed. Overpriced and the food was mediocre. There are better steaks in the city for the price. I get it it's a destination restaurant but for the price there are definitely better spots.,2
"Amazing restaurant.  Loved the food.  Our waiter Davide was great, he made suggestions and was spot on with everything he suggested.  Have food allergies and was able to accommodate me.  Would definitely be going back. Steak was Devine, desserts were so good and enjoyed the table side Caesar salad show.",4
Overall food was amazing! Dessert was mediocre. Service was a little slow. But overall loved it and would go back. Would have been nice if they acknowledged that it was our anniversary.,4
"We were a table of 6. Everyone's steak was PERFECT. Service was great, our server was wonderful. However it did take over an hour for us to get our food, and dessert was disappointing. 
The person in the valet parking booth was awful. Not the person who actually took my car (he was great!) But the person who told me the price and directed me where to park. He was having a very inappropriate personal conversation, was unpleasant and lacked basic manners. It didnt give me a good first impression. All other staff were wonderful.",3
Great service. Great room but..... My wife ordered a lobster tail with her filet and I could smell that it was off before it hit the table ! The fact that the chef let that tail leave the kitchen was astonishing to me. The fishy smell was overpowering and obvious that the tail was well past it‚Äôs prime. For a restaurant of this caliber this is unacceptable and shocking that it got by the staff and was allowed to be placed in front of a diner. In fairness it was promptly removed from the table and bill after I mentioned it. All in all we will most likely return as everything else was top notch,3
Blue Blood was amazing. The service and food was impeccable and worth going. The view and grounds are breath taking. Love it!,4
"Atmosphere was beautiful, so unique, service was excellent, food was amazing, steak rivaled best steakhouses of Chicago!",4
"you must be prresent in the hotels, i was in the anndor house and they dont know about you",4
"Nice food and staff, beautiful and elegant interior located inside Toronto's majestic castle Casa Loma surrounded by amazing view from wonderful terrace.",4
"the food was amazing the service amazing.
Just as a note there were too many small flies around which took the edge of having the great experience",3
BlueBlood 's decor and evocation of an old fashioned Toronto steakhouse is great fun and is done with skill. The food and service were quite fine.,3
"We had a marvelous time at BlueBlood. The service was exceptional as was the meal. I highly recommended the wagyu sirloin, I ordered the American cut and it melted in my mouth and paired well with the garlic mashed potatoes.",4
The place is way overpriced for a generally mediocre food quality. You are paying for the setup and the service.,1
I enjoyed everything,4
"Having dinner at a table in the garden with a castle behind you was an unbelievable experience. The ambiance, service and food was truly memorable.",4
"From start to finish this steakhouse had it all!!! I would recommend this restaurant to all perfect service, food and the atmosphere was worth its wait in gold we will be back",4
It was a wonderful meal and wonderful company.,4
"We‚Äôve  been to numerous upscale restaurants and don‚Äôt mind paying for great food and service. Blue Blood lacked attention to detail on numerous accounts. For a restaurant that wants to be considered upscale, they missed the mark. The food was good, but the service and experience failed in comparison to its competitor.",1
"I eat in a lot of steak houses for business...if you‚Äôre in Toronto, it is a must. Well done Blue Blood, great job on the bone-in Ribeye. ü§Øü§Øü§Øü•©ü•É",4
Amazing food and service.,4
Very posh environment. The food and service was excellent. By far our favourite restaurant for special occasions.,4
Amazing experience and wonderful food. Will definitely go again,4
It was just a fantastic evening spent with a special person that Blueblood Steakhouse made even more special with the attention we were given . Want to send a big THANKS to Geoff Patterson for surprising us with a tour of the wine cellar. Don‚Äôt think I can say anything further other than I cannot wait to come back .,4
"The atmosphere was great. We were seated at 7:15, enjoyed drinks and appetizers and did not get our meal until 9:30. We asked our waiter when our food was coming and he said the kitchen was backed up. There were tables that we seated after us, and were already leaving before our dinner came. When it did come the food was lukewarm. The food was very good, but I must say I was disappointed with this restaurant.",1
"Our first time at BlueBlood didn‚Äôt disappoint! The service is truly outstanding. From start to leaving. Valet parking attendants as well as all servers were very attentive. We had French onion soup; it was so flavourful. Amount of Cheese was perfect. It could have been warmer but we didn‚Äôt mention it. The foie Gras was outstanding served with poached figs and ice wine jell. Delicious!  And good size portion. My husband knows and loves a great burger so of course he had to have it. It was the best he‚Äôd had in a very long time. Perfectly cooked!  Juicy and full of meaty flavour, not masked in spices. We shared the Erin rib eye. It was perfectly medium rare. Outstanding flavour! Tender and juicy. Btw. Great steak knifes. And offerings of three different salts that you add yourself. Great touch. We ended our meal with lemon tart. They use fresh lemons. So No bitter aftertaste. ! Lovely. Our only complaint is there is very little space between the tables. A little more space would be nice for private conversations. So don‚Äôt expect what you say to be unheard by other guests. Most restaurants today have that issue. But we expected different at BlueBlood. Perhaps if we wanted a quiet corner they‚Äôd facilitated, we didn‚Äôt ask. We‚Äôd absolutely recommend it and look forward to going back.",4
Absolutely outstanding! Best steak we have ever had!,4
Beautiful restaurant and wonderful food! Had a wonderful evening. Would go back in a heartbeat.,4
Great new Paulo at BlueBlood. Great service and ambiance,4
"The food was excellent! The setting ‚Äî stunning. An anniversary evening splurge; definitely worth it as a special occasion place, if you have the $$$.",4
"Excelente Restaurante, exquisito el
Mignon de wagyu y el
Profiterole .
El servicio muy atentos.",4
"Extremely disappointing experience, waiter brought our salads at different times where one person finished before the other arrived. My steak which was asked to be prepared medium was medium rare and had to be cooked three times in total before they got it half right, at which point I had no interest in eating the steak. Drink orders were forgotten and it took 15min to get a request for bread processed. Atrocious service, food is below sub par for what‚Äôs considered a steakhouse. The manager apologized and explained it was only the second day they the patio had been open and the staff was not familiar with the grill at a STEAKHOUSE. We were comped 3 drinks to compensate for the salad mix up, nothing was said about the steak which was prepared 3 times.",0
"Everything was Fantastic, I took my wife for our Anniversary, our server was super helpful in assisting us with the selections of wine to pair with our food, the Wagyu was very delicious. 
We will be back!",4
Michael our server was simply outstanding. Everything was divine. They were so considerate.,4
"Overall, great place for special occassion, quite memorable experience. I took bf there to celebrate his bday. The restaurant is located inside of castle with historical decor. The waiters were very nice. We ordered prime steak tartare as starter, then seafood tower and canadian prime bone in center cut striplion/side of asparagus as main. The food tastes excellent. Actually I was quite full after these. So we ordered a small dessert, Artisan Sweet Trio. The waiter gave us a bday card and a small gift, very sweet! We enjoyed time here. The dinner lasted too long so it past 10pm. We only ended up walking around a bit on ground floor and backyard of the castle. 

Highly recommend here~

PS. The self parking was $15. You can have free tour access to the castle if you dine in Blueblood.",4
"VERY GOOD SERVICE AND EXCELLENT FOOD. 
THE DINNER AREA IS VERY COMFORTABLE AND BEAUTIFUL.
HIGHLY RECOMMEND....!!!!!!",4
"The food was excellent, but I found the pricing to be quite high, even considering it was a high-end Steakhouse. Three dinners, one appetizer, three drinks, two sides and one dessert came to $420 before tip. My husband and I eat out frequently, at least a few times a week, and often frequent high end restaurants. We just found that this was not worth the money for what it was. The steak was delicious and the sides were perfect, but I could say the same about other steakhouses that are significantly less. (My 16 oz ribeye was $75.)",3
"Great fine dining experience. Food was delicious, fresh, and well presented. Service was excellent.  Highly recommend.",4
"My husband and I came here for our 1st wedding anniversary. It was phenomenal. The service was amazing, and the food was right there with it. Best lamb I have EVER had (don‚Äôt tell my mom)",4
"We were disappointed in the Caesar Salad, too much lemon and not enough garlic.  My friend and I were at BlueBlood a  couple of years ago for my birthday dinner and we order the Ceaser salad twice that night.  The bone rib eye steak was very tender and made to order.  I ordered the veal chop not very tender and was not done medium rare more on the rare side.  The sweet potatoes were bitter and very hard to eat.  They were taken off my bill and I thank you for that.",3
We had a perfect evening on Saturday night. The service was outstanding. We all thoroughly enjoyed our meal. I would highly recommend your restaurant to friends and family. Thank you Susan Bugeja,4
Our first visit. Our waiter was excellent and made it a memorable time. The food was awesome. We will definitely be back.,4
"Outstanding food, treatment, waiter (Trevor!!! AMAZING!!) and vibe. Comfortable for families, couples, friends, of all ages and preferences.",4
We had a gorgeous dining experience at Blueblood Steakhouse and would highly recommend it for a special occasion. The food was superb and we loved the decor and setting. Getting to eat in the Casa Loma is truly a magical experience.,4
It was a very memorable anniversary and the staff knew ahead of time and gifted us with a beautiful card and wine stopper. The food was incredible and we left with our bellies quite full and happy.,4
"Great venue, energetic, interesting cocktails. Our table shared a few cuts - all were good, the US Wagyu was excellent",3
"Celebrating exactly year until our wedding day at Casa Loma, July 17 2020!",4
Wonderful experience start to finish. Our waiter was pleasant and made the experience even better. Will definitely be coming here for all future occasions!,4
"Food and service were good. Table seating (half couches) are very uncomfortable. We were given a window seat with the sun beaming through the 100 year old windows and the air conditioning not working properly. Asked to be moved which they gladly did. Same uncomfortable seating. Asked for a more comfortable round booth table and waiter told us he was not sure they were available. Requested booth was still unused after we had finished our dinner. 

Definite non repeat for us.",2
Birthday dinner for my best friend,4
"Smug service, my wife‚Äôs lobster tail was tough and stringy and the server blew it off.....the quality of my steak was very good",2
"Worth every cent, service was amazing and food was the best",4
Special birthday,4
"Food had no flavor and not worth the bill that we paid. The crab cakes seemed like they were in the oven for too long a. Lobster mac and cheese had no taste at all, lobster meat was not fresh. Black truffle mashed potatoes was ok, a little salty. Scallops were over cooked. The mushrooms for the steak tasted like plastic and had no flavor.  As nice as the place is, it was still not worth the price that we pay for the meal.",0
"What can you say about a super high-end steakhouse in a Castle?  Plenty of great vibes - the design is impressive and the  table-side caesar salad was delicious.  Most of the other items ordered were greasy, excessive and heavily salted.  The $40 burger was messy and didn't stack up against other burgers 1/4 of the price.  But Wagyu!  Meh, not worth it.  
It was a nice meal but very little value delivered.  Service was nice and a diet coke sat JUST OUT OF REACH for 10 minutes before making it to the table.  Our group didn't order much alcohol so it felt like that downgraded our service.",3
"Great waiter, thanks",3
"Probably the priciest meal we have ever eaten but worth every penny. Food is amazing, service impeccable and setting gorgeous.",4
"Amazing services!  Very attentive.
Food was delicious!",4
One of the best experience I encountered after along time. Our server was excellent... he made our experience beyond words!!! Food was fresh and served timely manner!!! Keep up the good work... will be visiting more often.,4
Fabulous restaurant for a special occasion experience!,4
Simply loved it! Delicious food and wonderful service.,4
"Food was very good , the steaks excellent. The ambiance in the bar/dining area wasn‚Äôt great so we transferred to the main dining room which was a lot better except..... I can‚Äôt believe how casual people dressed with shorts, t-shirts, guys wearing their baseball hat. Ya gotta have a dress code in a place like that.",3
It was a great experience for my wife and I for our anniversary dinner.   They also let us tour the wine cellar!  We had a great time.,4
"The food, service, and atmosphere are all amazing at this restaurant. I could not recommend Blueblood Steakhouse enough!",4
30th wedding anniversary.,4
"Staff and service was great.  Food was ok nothing great. Not worth the money. Ordered japanese A5 wagyu. My cut was fine but my girlfriends cut was garbage. We understand that It all depends on the cut for this special steak but she got the worst one. We complained about it but as the server said it all depends on where they cut the meat from. Tho we ordered the same steak. But anyhow, best to go somewhere else or if you do ever eat here dont order the japanese A5. Again, Mine was fine but my girlfriends cut was not.",2
Acosta was excellent.  Steak prepared perfectly.  Lobster Mac n cheese great.  Crab cakes -crab meat no fillers.  Highly recommend.,4
The service was great I forgot the name server otherwise would of included his name,4
I can Honestly say this is the Best Restaurant in Toronto ! Amazing food and service and it‚Äôs in a Castle! I would recommend BlueBlood Steakhouse for all !,4
Had an excellent 1st experience and a wonderful birthday dinner. Will definitely be back when we visit Toronto.,4
Wedding anniversary,4
"Food was disappointing. You should order the streak when you go. We had the sea bass and the burger. The fish was under seasoned, or not seasoned at all. The burger patty was too soft and soggy. 

The appetizers were good.",2
Great service great food amazing dining experience for my mom‚Äôs birthday.,4
"It was a great experience to dine at this restaurant, from the dining to the caring check ups we were getting from the staff they paid attention to all our dietary restrictions so that we would get the best of our enjoyment from this establishment, I am for sure going to recommend this place to everyone I know",4
Amazing food loved my experience in this restaurant. It was my second time and probably it's not my last. Really recommend it.,4
Amazing overall food and experience!! 10/10 Will return soon!,4
"Amazing food and service, our server Andy was excellent.",4
"Appetizers, sides, desserts were excellent. We shared 3 steaks. The PEI and Wichita steaks were good. Australian 10z wagyu was NOT good. Possibly the worst wagyu I‚Äôve ever had.",3
Celebrating graduation,4
"We had a wonderful birthday dinner! We didn't let the resto know in advance, my fianc√© told them when we arrived and they had a wonderfully nice birthday gift (wine stopper) and card for me at the end of our amazing service. Food was excellent, wine was excellent and service was incredible. While slightly (only slightly) more than the average high end steakhouse in Toronto, it was worth every penny. The only issue was that we were seated in a sunny spot - we were fine with it as wore sunglasses but others did change their seats. The simple fix is a shade fixture for late afternoon. We will be back.",4
The restaurant decor is modern yet classy. We ordered the steak tartare and porterhouse which was absolutely delicious. A lot for two people to share but we finished it and surprisingly didn‚Äôt feel too heavy afterwards. Definitely recommend! Great spot for a date or a special occasion. Prices are steep but you get what you pay for!,4
Hi My Name  is Bruno De Rose I brought my family for diner on June 20 . I had Sergio as a waiter. Let me tell you I have been to many steak house restaurants  but the service that I got was creditable . That food was cook awesome and tasted am amazing. I will go back. Its a must try.,4
Really enjoyed it. Top notch service and we will be back.,4
"I have been raving about Blue Bloods to friends and family ! Sergio our Server was AMAZING , aswell as food was top notch ! They even gave us a little card with a Wine Bottle Cork with the Casa Loma symbol on it for us to remember where we celebrated our 1st year wedding anniversary ... thanks to Blue Bloods and the amazing staff on making it one of the most memorable dinners we have had",4
"The restaurant is great for special occasion. We took our father here for father's day on a sunny afternoon. The ambiance was perfect. Selection for steak selection was pretty good including dry aged Canadian/US/Wagyu, but pricey. $60 for 8oz without any sides (starch/veg)",3
It was a perfectly elegant evening.,4
"This was a special occasion and it was truly special.  Amazing steak in a castle!! Loved the sharing style of the dishes. Loved the dry-age beef.   Prices look high - but, when we got the bill, it was reasonable (for what we were getting).   Loved the curl bench seating which was great for our celebrating party of 4. 

Loved the attention to allergy restrictions for 1 of our guests. And, the food presentation was over-all excellent.  Loved being able to see the wine cellar and the dry age area in the basement.   Servers were knowledgeable and patiently explained many questions around the menu selections.. i.e. different ways to age beef, optimal aging time, truffles and why the oil for the bread was so special.,,p

1 minor disappointment: having to pay for parking??!!  Compared to Scaramouch who provide free valet parking so you feel like a king / queen from the point you arrive, it was disappointing to have to pay $10 for parking. 

Another: the noise level was just a little too loud. It was sometimes hard to hear the conversation at the table.  I believe some of the noise was coming from a wedding next door.  But, even after the wedding went inside to their ball-room, I found the noise from surrounding tables weighed in on our experience.",3
"This is a very nice setting for a special occasion. The table service is good and the assistance with the wine list was very informative. I don‚Äôt love the iPad wine list, that‚Äôs my  preference. The  Caesar salad prepared table side was very enjoyable and is always a good choice at a stake house.  The meat was not cooked as I had asked it to be when I had ordered it. It was underdone. This along with the grade off meat was not up to the standards of some of the other stake houses in Toronto.",2
"blueblood was good, but the server could be a little nicer. he was good with saying ""youre welcome"" and ""of course"" after we asked things/made comments, but a warm smile to at least act like he enjoyed serving us would have allowed me to give service 5 stars. it was a tall white man with a beer belly and whitish/brown slicked back hair. he was working the day of wednesday june 12, 8pm.",4
"I do not like that the truffle oil is put on the table in a bottle.
It should be in something nicer.
I  do not like the round cutlery,it is hard to hold.
The shrimp cocktail was tough and the sauce was very bland.
The steaks are not seasoned,they lack taste.
Garlic would be great !
The salad with blue cheese had barely any cheese on it and we had to ask for more.
 
Our server was amazing and so sweet.

We had a great table.

Love the room.

Happy to see a better variety of desserts ,the baled Alaska is not very good.


The wine was very good.",2
"Had dinner at Blueblood with my wife to celebrate our 1 year anniversary.  Everything about the evening was fantastic.  Right from pulling in and seeing the beauty of Casa Loma and the surrounding grounds.  Add to that the fact that the food was superb, made for a very special first anniversary.  The wagyu tasting platter and crab legs are highly recommended.  The hosts, servers and management all went out of their way to check on us and make sure everything was to our expectations. A very special thanks for the little tour and history lesson after dinner, where our waiter took us down to see the wine cellar and meat aging rooms.  I highly recommend Blueblood for any occasion.",4
"My wife and I had a lovely anniversary here!  The Gorgonzola gnocchi side dish and smoke scallop main dish were outstanding.  We booked ourselves in a little early on a Sunday at 5 PM so we got spoiled by our server Brendan who had a plethora of information and recommendations about the food.  Now if you don't have Drake's pocketbook or better, do some homework on the menu beforehand.  A lot of dishes are suitable for sharing and this and limiting drinks can help keep the bill from getting into uncomfortable levels.  We came hoping for a special experience and indeed that is what we had.  We will return!",4
So over rated for the food quality and poor service. Never going back or tell a friend about thus place.,2
I have no words to explain how amazing this place was! Thank you for giving us a tour of the castle as well!,4
Thank you to Dax (hope spelled it correctly) Jeffery and Tiara for making the night so enjoyable.,4
"Excellent service, excellent food and incredible ambiance. 
What a treat . My new favourite restaurant",4
Excelente lugar para cerrar la noche en Toronto... todo muy rico y gran servicio!....,4
My reservation was for 9:15 and we were seated at 9:50 without explanation,0
"We had an amazing experience. A very special place. I had the sea bass that was perfection and my husband had a rib eye steak which he said was
wonderful.  The wait staff were particularly efficient.  They were not hovering but extremely attentive. It was my husband‚Äôs birthday and they surprised him with a little gift and a candle in his dessert. Our experience was memorable and we will definitely book again.",4
"Beautiful restaurant, with amazing service. The food was excellent and worth the price.",4
"Dropped 1000 for a dinner for three. 
Not  unusual in Toronto 
Steaks cooked well 
Good wine list 
Ricotta cheese cake a must",3
This eloquent classy five star steak house made for an unforgettable dinning experience for my wife an my anniversary. The servers were extremely attentive and accommodating. The whole time we wanted for nothing. The food was cooked for perfection. We will be dinning here again. Totally worth it!,4
Amazing staff and service. 10/10,4
"Great food, great ambiance, very good and knowledgeable service.  Expensive but worth it for a special occasion.  We were seated near the bar, and given the room has very hard surfaces, very noisy.  There were groups standing by the bar that tended to crowd in on us - and the server had to ask them to step back and sit down, and then apologized to us.  Otherwise a fun outing",4
It's pricy but it's nice to have dinner at casa Loma.,4
"A quick descent into tourist-trap status, sadly. Such a shame given the beauty of the place.

The food is ridiculously average and often poor, especially given the surroundings and the exorbitant price. My $180 tomahawk steak was so drastically under-cooked and sinew-laden I had to send it back to be cooked further AND cut, as I couldn‚Äôt get a knife through it. Side dishes are sloppy and mediocre, with the spinach a watery mess. Sweet potato fries were tasty, but still run-of-the-mill. Cocktails are hit and miss, which at $22+ per shouldn‚Äôt be the case. The iPad drink-ordering system is frustrating and bulky to use. 

Service is average to surly; a couple staff could use a personality transplant, especially the grump bartender who deflects small-talk like you‚Äôre a hindrance to his mood.

Nothing here lives up to the locale, so far. Stunning rooms, very classy and beautifully designed to both respect and update the Casa Loma building. Great decor.",2
All was excellent. The only criticism was the lamb chops were not hot nor was the double baked potato,4
"A delicious dinner with excellent service in a beautiful setting. Try the table side Caesar salad which was expertly prepared with panache. You won‚Äôt be disappointed! 
Blue blood‚Äôs has all  right ‚Äúingredients‚Äù in making a milestone birthday even more memorable.",4
"I can't say enough about our experience at BlueBlood Steakhouse! The food, the service, the ambiance, everything was AMAZING!!! Will definitely be going back soon ü•Ç",4
It was a great experience for me and my girlfriend,4
Excellent menu and service. Parking should be free though,4
"Big thanks to Michael T and Ethan, food and service was great and they let us go upstairs to take a nice photo for my girlfriends birthday. 

Thank you,

Andrew",4
Had a wonderful experience at Blueblood Steakhouse. Would definitely recommend it!!!,4
"If you want to celebrate a big birthday milestone, an anniversary, a graduation, anything special at all this is the place to go! The waiters were excellent, they were so professional, and thoughtful and nice, not snobby or uptight. We were a party of 5 and had a wonderful night. The location is gorgeous, and the food is devine! The caesar salad, the ribs, the steak, and the dessert. If you want to get a beautiful display of fire, try the baked Alaska for dessert ;).  We could not have made the night as special without the staff at the BlueBlood Steakhouse.  Thanks for making my friends 40th birthday a night she won't forget! 

Sukhy",4
Food took an awfully long time from when we had our first water poured for us to apps and from apps to main course. Didn't seem incredibly busy.,1
"The food was outstanding and the cocktails and wine even better will definitely be back . 
The sommelier suggested the perfect wine for us . 
Thank you to Jeff as well , he was very accommodating to find us a table in the bar for deserts . 
We will definitely be back",4
"My wife‚Äôs filet was not cooked as ordered and the wait staff was indifferent when pointed out.  A drink was ordered and was never delivered.  Long wait for main course.  Quality of food was decent, but nothing close to cost of meal.  Ambience is very nice, but sidearm chairs at table for two were uncomfortable and awkward to sit in.  Overall, not an impressive experience.",2
"I can‚Äôt possibly give this place any less than a 5. 
We went out for my hubbys birthday with friends on Friday night. From the moment we stepped out of our Uber, the night was exceptional. (With the sight exception that one of the girls at the front door was not too friendly).
We ordered (and ate) like kings. Everything was amazing. The seafood tower, Cesar salad, tomahawk steak, veal chop, braised short ribs, asparagus, polenta, gnocchi, duck fat fries, banana crepes, baked Alaska and key lime pie. All were incredible; maybe I was least pleased with the fries.
If you‚Äôre looking for the nicest restaurant in the city, this is it.",4
It was an amazing evening. From the minute we walked in everyone is warm and friendly.  The service was impeccable and the dinners suggested were spot on. I would definitely recommend Bluebloods to all,4
"My experience here was impeccable. Staff were extremely friendly, courteous and provided quick and timely service to us. The lobster mac and cheese was very tasty. I found the steak a tad bit salty and needed a bit more flavour; nonetheless it was still good.  We were celebrating a birthday and were given a private castle tour after dinner. This was a great touch to end our evening.",4
From the drinks to the food to the service. Everything was absolutely perfect. My husband and I are still talking about it and cant wait to come back.,4
Beautiful ambiance for that perfect date night. Food is good but not great. It would also be great to see some California wines on the list.,3
"The ambiance was really great, felt like a true and modern steakhouse. The food was delicious and the service was impeccable.",4
It was an awesome evening with outstanding dishes. Hope to be back soon again.,4
Best steak ever! Best waiter and manager. They gave us VIP treatment.,4
"This an over the top elegant experience for very special occasions only. We went for a family birthday and were not disappointed. Some customers seated next to us had children with entitlement issues, this is not a child friendly environment ,  but overall it was a lovely unusual experience. 
The prices were very high but the food was excellent. Very special.",4
"Amazing food, very pricey, stunning ambiance. The only thing we found extremely odd and annoying was the constant running around in circles by the management. There wasn‚Äôt a need as the tables were empty beside us. It actually became quite annoying and they really need to tone the walking around in circles. But everything other then that was really great. I definitely would recommend this restaurant",3
"Was very impressed on how polite and nice  EVERYONE was very respectful polite and nice...from the moment we pulled up to the moment we got back into our car...
The food was very nice 
Was very happy to share our anniversary with blue blood steakhouse. Will be coming again.",4
"Great location for a special occasion or high profile business meeting. Stellar service, excellent ambiance, and amenities fit for a king or queen.",3
One of the best dining experiences I‚Äôve ever had.,4
"It was my first time at blue blood steak house I did a surprise birthday dinner for two everything I ask for they did it and it was nice and easy, service was amazing every staff was nice, the venue was so romantic and nice ( everyone should know that cause it's inside castle Loma ) their steak hands down was one of the best steak ever and it was a good size, food was fulfilling,  and for sure will come back",3
"Great meal, service was excellent.  My second time dining there and both times it exceeded my expectations.",4
Spectacular service and food in a perfect romantic ambiance .,4
"Great menu, wonderful service and lovely atmosphere.",3
Top notch service. Costa is a supreme waiter as well as Vito. Caesar salad is table side outstanding. Best service ambiance and customized service in town. Anita Marshall,4
"To start off, our server was impeccable and did an amazing job throughout the entire dinner. However this steak house is not comparable to many steakhouses in Toronto. For the standard it claims to have, I was highly disappointed in the food throughly.",0
"The atmosphere was divine and beautiful! The service was very professional and informative. I would have liked to have a little less stuffiness and more ""light-hearted"" of a server, but she was very attentive and polite. 
The seabass I order was delicious as well as the sides we ordered. 
My husband ordered the Canadian steak but was not overly impressed. It was not bad by any means, I think he expected more flavor. 

Overall, we loved the experience!",4
We had a wonderful evening. I had let the restaurant know in advance that I was 'on a date' with my 13 year old son and they were super attentive and kind. The food was superb - I highly recommend the crab cakes and the profiteroles. I was very impressed with their 'by the glass' wine list as well. The noise level was high - I'm wondering if part of that was a party that was in one side of the room though. One of the great things was that I never felt that I was being hurried through my meal. I would give yourself 2.5 to 3 hours to eat here. A wonderful change from so many places where you feel that you are being ousted out the door. We will be back.,4
Really nice ! The castle is beautiful!,4
"Beautiful dining room, ambient lighting. Impeccable service. Food was great. Obviously a higher end restaurant so good for special occasions.",4
Fantastic! It is so nice to finally see Casa Loma being used!,4
"Elegant Dining
We loved our experience here after an afternoon touring Casa Loma. Delightful cocktail in the bar, dinner in the dining room. Spouse loved his steak tartare, I wish my salmon had tasted a bit fresher. But, overall, a very special evening.",4
"I loved the ambience and the service of the waiters and hostess were great! 
But a little disappointed in the food, the seafood platter for two was great, but they did not have any melted butter for the lobster. The steak was amazing, but the sides were disappointing. The garlic mashed did not even taste the garlic, the gnocchi gorgonzola tasted more of the parmesan and no gorgonzola at all. Did not get enough for the value. It's a shame when you spend $300 on a meal, you want all if it to be spectacular.",3
"After spending some time in Budapest with all their high end 5 and 6 * star dining experiences. I hadn‚Äôt found any comparable restaurants until now.  So when I discovered they‚Äôre was  a restaurant in the castle. I had to try it and  found the presentation to exceed even the Gundel in Budapest.  We are definitely come back. ( after we try your other restaurant Don Alfonso)
Thanks so much for a wonderful experience and the mini tour of the castle with your mamagrr",4
"One of the best steakhouse restaurants this city has to offer, with spectacular service and attention to your needs,  but you'll pay a very hefty price for this luxury.    We think it was worth the price.",4
Date night with wife.  Best ambiance of any restaurant in the city.  Food was great and price is consistent with quality.  Love the place!,4
"Excellent steakhouse. The food, service, and ambiance were amazing.",4
"Awesome spot, ambience and food are incredible.",4
Everything was excellent except the server was a bit intense. It was the only negative thing about the evening to the point my gf said something about it.,4
"Very slow service, took 2 hours to have apps and main, we gave up on having dessert. One starter got mixed up and the guest had to wait again for the correct one. However, food was delicious, we ordered mostly seafood options, so would be willing to try it again, maybe they were short staffed.",3
"Wish I had a table in the main room instead of a smaller room. The food and service were good but the first time I went, it was exceptional, so this time was a bit of a let down. It is partially my fault as I should have called the restaurant directly and asked for the main dining room.",3
"Am and my family went for two birthday stars in my family, all the staffs were so friendly and polite, food is so delicious and over expectation.",4
"Amazing, a-maazing service I really can't emphasize how great the service here is!  They honestly make you feel like royalty, no matter what the occasion.  I had a low-key birthday celebration here and they were so accommodating and kind and made me feel super special, could not have chosen a better place to spend it. Thanks so much! <3",4
"Anthony and Jenny (the female waitress within the dining room) were amazing servers and provided us with everything and then some. Anthony's support staff were outstanding and completely on top of all the parties and customers within the lounge area. 
Simon provided great managerial services checking on our table and ensuring out experience was to standard. Everything was outstanding from the food to the service. 12 / 10 will return for another experience",4
"Increible cena en un castillo, el lugar es lo  mejor el contraste de el lujo y los cuadros modernos da un toque magico",3
"Everything was excellent: the cocktails, wine, food, ambience and especially the service.",4
Food was good.  Service outstanding. Beautiful space,4
"Interesting ambiance, excellent service and even better food. The steak was absolutely fabulous, cooked to perfection. Overall it‚Äôs very expensive but it‚Äôs worth it for a special occasion.",3
"Will try to revisit. It is a change. Will try different dishes. Now I have to find somebody who will take me there, and i don't have to use my credit card  ha ha
Is this 50 words?",4
"While the food was good, and our waiter was quite capable, unfortunately they are seemingly governed by the Casa Loma Events staff. 

When we dined at BlueBlood, they were setting up for a wedding just outside the dinning area, which affected the ambiance. My elderly father had to visit the washroom, and the BlueBlood staff directed him just down the hall. Just prior to reaching the washrooms, a large fellow stepped into my fathers path, and stated that they were attempting to ""Clear the area"" (presumably for the wedding) and my father would have to head downstairs into the basement (by the cafe) to use the facilities there.

I suggest that those with mobility issues, or who want to use facilities they too are paying to access, choose a destination other than BlueBlood, as our experience was quite poor.",2
"The experience was great, but overall not too impressive. 

Unfortunately our service was subpar for two reasons: 

1) Spilled Drink - the server spilled one of our drinks and did not replace it until 20 minutes later when we demanded it. 

2) Raw Salmon - it was not suppose to be sashimi, but came raw. When taken back to the kitchen, they just heated it up and re-served the same deconstructed piece. I would have expected a new piece all together at that price. 

Overall, still a great experience based on the ambiance of the castle itself. However, due to the service and non-impressive food, I can only recommend based on the great room of the restaurant.",2
"Birthdays

The experience was very nice",4
"I took the opportunity to take my wife to the BlueBlood Steakhouse for our 1 year wedding anniversary and left extremely satisfied with our overall dining experience. The ambiance was quiet and tasteful. Our waiter was attentive, clear and concise throughout the whole evening in meeting all of our needs and the food quality was nothing short of exceptional. Casa Loma was where I first proposed to my wife and our first rate experience at BlueBlood Steakhouse further enhanced our affinity with the castle and our satisfaction with your establishment and we will highly recommend BlueBlood to our family and friends for years to come.
Thank you so much for a memorable evening and for a wonderful dining experience.
Nick and Lina.",4
My sons 26th birthday and we dined with family. The staff was fabulous and food was incredible! A++,4
"Amazing service, amazing food, amazing staff.. and they make birthday celebrations feel so special",4
"While I believe my experience there was better 8 months ago, I still enjoyed the meal. Best Cesar Salad in years.  We shared a 40oz Steak with 3 men. Won't do it again. Not enough meat and it looked like it cut too early.   Sides were great and the service was solid.",3
Everything was top notch! A truly memorable experience!,4
"The BlueBlood Steakhouse is located in the beautiful Casa Loma castle. The seating is not only elegant, but romantic as well. I was sitting with my boyfriend in a beautiful leather booth and was very fond of the quietness and intimacy we could feel throughout the dinner. 
The service was enjoyable and very professional, however, the waiter kept insisting on us buying more food when we were clearly already full. 
The steaks were delicious. The chimichurri sauce is a must, however, the cognac peppercorn sauce was mediocre and not very flavourful as it usually is. 
The lobster mac and cheese was a little dry and the cheese was a little chewy. 
The gnocchi gorgonzola dish was good, however, the crispy kale was extremely salty. The manager was very nice and took it off our bill but my boyfriend and I could not understand how a kale dish would be that salty. 
Also, they had brought bread and butter (made with chive, if I recall) but it had almost no taste. 
In spite of all of that, the service was good and friendly. The chocolate caramel truffle at the end was very pleasant. It was my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday and loved the fact they gave him a birthday card and a cork that was very elegant. Overall, the experience was good and romantic but the food was a little disappointing.",3
The room is gorgeous and the staff are exceptional.,4
"Such and amazing experience. 
Celebrated my boyfriends birthday with such amazing staff and exceptional drink and food menu. Was really happy I chose that location.",4
Once again the food and service at BlueBlood was exceptional. Dined with some first timers who were very impressed and would definitely return. Great job!,4
"I have never written a review from a restaurant experience but this one I have to. We were 3 couples celebrating a special birthday and I had made the reservation a few months in advance. I took the time to call 2-3 times leading up to the date to request seating in the bar area, and to arrange a special birthday platter with desserts and a message written on the platter.  The woman who answered the phone the day of said the birthday arrangement was no problem and they have secured us a table in the bar area.  We were going to be 10-15 min late so I called on our way down and was reassured it was no problem, but when we got there a hostess told us our table wasn‚Äôt ready and we were being taken to a special mezzanine area to wait.  At first we were confused as to where we were going but thought maybe this is some cool upper level to the restaurant. To our surprise it was an upper level in the building that felt like an abandoned wreck hall.  There were a few bottles of champagne on ice which we assumed for us for the awkward inconvenience, but were told no.  We were not given any drinks and to be honest it was unacceptable for a dining establishment like this.  When we finally got to our table the experience was ok.  Service was fine but food was mediocre compared to other restaurants of this caliber and price.  I spoke to the manager during the evening about our experience when walking in and he apologized and seemed genuine about doing something to rectify.  Rather then taking some drinks off the bull or giving us the dessert on the house, they brought us a new drink for the table (that was awful and no one liked) and an EXTRA dessert that were on the house, but charged us for the 3 that were ordered and took nothing off the bill.  We dine at several steakhouses around the city and high end restaurants and I have to say this was the most disappointing experience.  On top of all that, the desserts never had a birthday message.  We will not be back.",0
"Wow what an amazing dining experience!  We celebrated a birthday dinner on a Thursday night at this outstanding restaurant.  It was truly a first class evening from the moment we arrived.  The decor for the main dining area was romantic and classic yet modern and comfortable.  We saw people on dates as well as business meetings around us.  The service was top notch with constant tending to our table and needs.  Lindsay was knowledgeable and really made the meal spectacular.  The menu was one of a kind with the largest selection of steaks that we have ever seen.  The salads were generous and the sides were all suitable for 3 people to share.  Taste was exquisite and the dishes were well presented.  There were so many fine details to the meal that I will likely miss some but there were some that stood out.  There was someone there to hold the door open when we arrived.  There was an interesting array of salts to sample with the meats.  There was a dark chocolate from a lovely box to complete the meal.  There were cloth bags for our take home leftovers and they even gave us beautiful wine corks to take home customized for the restaurant.  They gave us an artisan trio for dessert for my husband‚Äôs birthday and even a hand written birthday card.  They offered us a brief tour of the art around the restaurant and you can also tour the main floor of the castle.   Of all the worldwide restaurants across Europe, and North America, this one really stands out as a unique dining experience.  We will definitely return.  The meals are expensive but keep in mind that the portions are generous and one can easily share plates.  It was such a magical night that you feel that you have truly paid for an experience not just food.  Highly recommend the wagyu beef, the baked Alaska - video tape the table service, the Caesar salad, and the seafood tower.  Can‚Äôt wait to return!",4
Anniversary,2
"I never write reviews.  But from the team welcoming you, the dining area, ambience, knowledge of servers, and of course quality of food this was a great birthday experience for myself and fianc√©e.  They even gave her a special ‚Äòtreat‚Äô at the end to wish her happy birthday.  And finally we got a tour of the grounds after dinner.",4
The servers were OUTSTANDING and polite:),4
"Great experience, amazing food, and friendly staff, couldn't ask for better service !!!",4
"A little pricey but worth the experience and the food was amazing, service is top notch! Thank you",4
"Service was great. 
Out if all the food we tried, kale chips were my favourites.",4
"FROM THE VALET PARKING ATTENDANT  TO THE HOSTESSES , OUR WAITER , THE SALAD CHEF , THE WINE WAITER  AND THE YOUNG MAN WHO GAVE US A CASTLE TOUR , EVERYONE  WAS OUTSANDING !!!! 
THE FOOD WAS PERFECTION AND THE PRESENTATION OF ‚ÄúONCE UPON A TIME‚Äù DRINK WAS  OVER THE TOP! 
WE WILL BE BACK 100%",4
"The room was beautiful, but the sun was setting and directly in our eyes. The servers were very attentive and the food was presented beautifully! It was very romantic. Kudos to the chef!",4
"Excellent experience a bit pricy, having said that I‚Äôll come back",4
"Exceptional service, great ambiance and the food was spectacular.",4
Everything was excellent,4
This place is fabulous. It‚Äôs in an old castle. Waiter was very attentive.  Bananas Foster cooked table side.  Very impressed.,4
Officially my new favorite spot. Everything exceeded my high expectations.,4
I do like blue blood a lot mostly I think because the idea of eating in Casa Loma is so much fun ... and everything is so beautiful ... service is very good ... food is tasty prices high it‚Äôs almost worth it but size of meal should be a little bigger and seafood portions very small for price being charged ! But would still come back !,2
"Loved it food was amazing steak was perfect, will definitely be going back",4
Always an amazing experience! Food and service were exceptional,4
Everything was beyond expectations.  It was the perfect way to celebrate our anniversary.,4
Way overpriced for decent food. There are significantly better steakhouses in Toronto which  are better value,2
"Had not been back since around the time they opened. The food, I must say was really good much better than the first time I went and we had a really nice experience .. staff were very attentive which makes the evening better and always more enjoyable",4
Amazing food!,4
We had such a great time . I was celebrating my daughters birthday and they didn‚Äôt disappoint. Our waiter Sergio was amazing . Such great service. The food was delicious and the restaurant was amazing. I will definitely go back .,4
"I would describe the service as very attentive. Your knowledgeable staff was a pleasure.
The food was delicious, but definitely not worth the incredible cost. 
I found the prices shocking for a restaurant located in a family venue. I expected steakhouse prices, I did not expect a months car payment!",1
Sergio our waiter was outstanding. Blue Blood is magical. It consistently delivers impeccable service and a memorable dining experience.,4
"Our server was fantastic. He was completely knowledgeable of the menu, choices, and cooking methods of the food. He made our experience even more special.",4
"The service was on point, the food was exceptional, the overall dining experience was phenomenal!  I will definitely come back and will absolutely refer my friends and family!!!",4
Unforgettable experience. The service was impeccable. The food was exquisite. I have nothing but good things to say about Blueblood Steakhouse. The cost for dinner was fair. Quality food served by high caliber staff in a 105 year old building with deep history is worth paying for.,4
"I booked a week in advance for myself and my husband and the only time available was 5pm which for us is fine as we don‚Äôt typically dine past 6pm.  We were in a smaller area seated near the fireplace which was nice but they seated us next to a party of 8.  Now clearly a party of 2, in which I stated was for my husband and I, would lean toward a more intimate dinner so why we were seated next to a party of 8 is beyond me.  Especially when there were 2 other tables of two in our area that were available and would‚Äôve provided a more intimate dining experience. In fact, there weren‚Äôt any other diners in our area other than the party of 8 right beside us.
The service was great.  The food was slightly overpriced and not to my liking. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the food was done well but just not the taste I was expecting or wanting. Sometimes less it better. The grilled asparagus was served with beurre blanc but it appeared and tasted like cheese.  The Creme Br√ªl√©e did not provide the flavour I was expecting and my husband‚Äôs lemon meringue pie looked and tasted like cheesecake. 
There was however a pleasant surprise with a gift to my husband which is a cork wine cork topper with an image of Casa Loma on the top and we got to take a quick tour of the castle free of charge. 
I will likely go back in the summer for one more go and take a walk through the gardens.",2
"Everything was great , my husband ordered seabass which was really good and amazing value , i had steak which was ok ,",4
I really enjoyed my friday evening at the BlueBlood Steakhouse. I went to celebrate my girlfriends birthday.  Food was cooked to prefection especially the steak. Everyone in my party enjoyed the service and food. Waiters and waitresses were extremely accommodating making sure we were comfortable.  My girlfriend who was celebrating her birthday was deeply touched by the birthday card/gift they gave her. My only complaint is that I would have  like to see diversity in the staff . But other than that a great experience. Thank-you!,3
"Excellent service and good food. Comparable to the best steakhouses in Toronto.
A place you take visitors and your grandparents.",3
We had a great evening and the service was excellent.,4
A special place.  Quite a destination location with quality food to match,4
"Amazing location, food and service!  It is now a must visit ever time we are in Toronto!",4
BlueBlood was an awesome experience. The food was satisfying and extremely flavorful. I deflected this restaurant to celebrate a friend‚Äôs birthday and she was beyond delighted.  We will definitely be celebrating more occasions here in the future.,4
Very delicious and a good place to celebrate a birthday.,3
The steak did not live upto the fame and was very dry.,1
Great bday experience.  The seats were perfect.,4
"They advertised free corkage, then on arrival they retracted their initial claim and honored only 1 bottle as previously discussed.",3
Celebrated a 74th birthday at BlueBlood and we were not disappointed. The staff were very attentive and the food was amazing. Definitely recommend the Porter House to share which was cooked to perfection and the beef tartare is a must. Thanks BlueBlood for a memorable dinner!,4
Food was very good. Value for cost...questionable. Wine list was ridiculously high.,3
Very overpriced for ordinary food.  Service while attentive was extremely slow.  Setting provides a point of  interest.,2
"Being inside Casa Loma was a treat in and of itself. The table, food, ambiance were very good. The service was spectacular although there were some slow spots that could have been avoided.  Paying for valet when dropping thousands for dinner is a minor league error. All in a 4.75 /5.0 is reasonable.",3
"Came here for my boyfriend's birthday based on my cousin's recommendation. Blueblood did not disapppoint! We got the steak tartare, dry aged tomahawk to share and the lobster Mac and cheese. The tartare and steak were magical and our server was charming, informative and personable. The card and the wine stopper for my bf was such a sweet touch.

Definitely would recommend!",4
"Good place. Very fancy and high class. Food is overpriced but you pay for the fancy castle. The lobster in the seafood platter was overcooked and didn't have any taste but the rest of the food we had (steak, lamb, and cake) were excellent. Waiter forgot it was my wife's birthday even though I told him and he said he will do soemthing nice for her. It's a nice place to try if you don't mind spending money but if you want steak and seafood, go somewhere cheaper.",3
"It doesn‚Äôt get much better than a meal in a castle. Phenomenal location and ambiance at Casa Loma. Food is spectacular, the steaks are great served along with several salt options or sauce if you like. The French onion soup is to die for, some of the best I‚Äôve ever had. The side are great, the broccolini and duck fat fries are delightful add one to the steak. Big wine list to choose from and a knowledgeable sommelier on site.",4
"Food was ok not worth the price 
Ambient was great
Service was good",2
"This is 100% the best dining experience in Toronto - food, service, ambiance... it was amazing!",4
"Me and my fianc√© really enjoyed our meal from the moment we stepped inside we had the best experience in terms of service, quality and friendliness. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure were pleased with our meal and the service was above and beyond. We had the sirloin steak and the kale salad with the duck fat fries and everything was delicious. I would also recommend for dessert the double baked sided Alaska for 2 as it had an amazing taste and it was really enjoyable to watch the waiter prepare it. They will see us there more often !",4
"The service was impeccable. Our waiter was professional and knowledgeable. He asked about allergies and food sensitivites and made great recommendations based on our input. The dining room is comfortable, clean and cozy with the fire place and wood paneling. After dinner, we were given a private tour to follow up with questions about a possible wedding venue. Amazing experience!",4
"How this restaurant is not yet a Michelin Star dining establishment is beyond me! The ambiance, staff and amazing food exceeded my parties expectations.",4
"Todo perfecto,,el lugar, la comida, el servicio, es un Must d√© Toronto",4
"Definitely a special occasion must! The whole experience was lovely and all the staff were attentive and pleasant. The Seafood Tower is spectacular and the Baked Alaska (for two) leaves plenty for four with an entertaining presentation. We especially loved the ever charming Simon who gave us a tour. What a spectacular use of this space in the heart of the city. Wine list is a bit steep but with all the rest, in for a penny in for a pound.",4
Wonderful belated Valentines dinner!   The service and ambiance was outstanding.,4
It was a great night . Me and my boyfriend had a great birthday night there. Everything was the same that i want and thanks to all of youü•Ç‚úÖü•Ç,4
"The overall experience for our dinner has been outstanding. The service and attention to detail from decor, glassware, quality of drinks through to meal appearance and more importantly rich flavour, in my books deserves an A+. 
Maybe a little expensive for everyday, but perfect for special occasions or just simply indulgence.  Would recommend to anyone who wants to be pampered with great quality food, and detailed quality service. 
Will return soon. 
-Alice",4
"Throughly enjoyed our dinner! Everything tasted so good and service was amazing and always available! Had the Steak Tartare to start, Wagyu Rib Eye, Black Truffle Mash and Seafood Tower for entree, and ended with the Profiterole and Ricotta Cheesecake for dessert. The complimentary bread (mmm truffle oil) and post dinner chocolate were a nice touch. We got a half bottle of Red and two cocktails as well. Our bill was $500 for 2 and well worth it. Lastly, Valet is available for $15 ($10 regular parking). Definitely returning.",4
Most food items are fantastic but some didn‚Äôt seem to be same quality.  Got the feeling that some dishes were pre made or potentially pre frozen.  For the price and experience I‚Äôd expect better.,2
Absolutely incredible.  Everything was perfect.  Food was off the chart good.  Caesar salad amazing.  Steak was crazy good.   Baked Alaska and banana crepes wonderful.  Best restaurant in toronto and perhaps canada !!!,4
The food was hot and totally acceptable. The waiter made lots of mistakes.  The salad made tableside was a lot of effort and money for Iceberg lettuce and a few fresh ingredients.,3
Would definitely go again. Service was fantastic & food was marvellous. Waiter helped me choose a drink selection based on my taste & the drink he suggested was perfect for me. Really enjoyed the preparation of the salad that happens in front of your table. Extremely classy place - perfect for any occasion.,4
Great experience. We will come back for sure.,4
"Amazing atmosphere, service and food were incredible. Portions are a tad small. Overall an amazing place for fine dining",4
Like stepping into a scene from mad men....old school steakhousr,4
It was amazing,4
Beautiful atmosphere and outstanding service! Food was very high quality and delicious! Enjoyed every moment,4
"For a Valentine's dinner it was exactly what I was expecting and more. Service was exceptional. We started with 'Table-Side Caesar Salad' which was very delicious. I would highly recommend. We enjoyed a 'Bone-In Ribeye' and 'Castle Dry-Aged Striplion'. Both were full of flavour and melted in your mouth. In addition, we chose a bottle of 'E.Guigal. Hermitage, Syrah 2010', which was served in a stunning decanter. We loved the first bottle and decided to try something from their extensive cellar. Mark suggested a bottle of 'Clos Saron 2006' was a very unique bottle, just not all the sediment was caught in the decanter. It was a great recommendation regardless. He also made the experience that much more special by providing a tour of the wine cellar. We did also have 'Table-Side Cr√™pes' which they switched to berries instead of bananas. They were amazing with the ganache and whip cream. The decor is luxurious, the mix of new with the old and modern with nature. Great place for a special occasion. They also had cocktails in the library as a Valentine's event, very romantic and special way to end the evening.",4
I came to the restaurant to surprise my girlfriend for her birthday. She loved it and enjoyed the food. The service was very good. It definitely surpassed my expectations.,4
"Obviously the Castle offers one of the best backdrops you could ever have, and the restaurant itself is beautiful, but the food and the service is seriously lacking.  Compared to any of the other high end steakhouses in Toronto, this is the worst in terms of value.",2
Great! Amazing food,4
"Food and service were amazing. My wife and I, enjoyed each moment in this place.",3
The restaurant has been perfectly situated within Casa Loma. The setting and ambience are fantastic. We were greeted at the door and shown to our table - from valet parking to table was flawless. The food was prepared beautifully and the presentation was superb. Flavour and range of food was terrific. Overall an excellent experience.,3
The bone in veal chop needs to be more soft,4
"Hello, and thank you for hosting us Friday for dinner. I will say just for feedback purposes that we enjoyed our meal for the most part, I thought the side mushrooms were over salted, also I can say that the four gras was bland and slightly over cooked. I work in the industry as well. Over all experience I would say 7 out of 10. Hope this helps. Thank you again.",3
"Great service right from the Valet Parking through to desert. Bar staff was profession and engaged in conversations and made drink suggestions. Waiter was great at making recommendations as well and food was perfect. 

Well enjoyed by everyone I‚Äôm my party.

Thanks again for making it memorable!",4
"I really enjoyed the service and treatment we got while at Blueblood.  It was for my GFs birthday and I felt like they really made a big deal out of it which I appreciated that.  The food was good, nothing was outstanding, but good.  I would return for a special occasion because I think the service and experience is that good.",3
Service was excellent. Staff is professional and goes above and beyond to make sure you have an outstanding experience! Food is just crazy delicious! Thank you for the great night! Will definitely come back!,4
"My husband and I had a great time at blueblood. The food was amazing, worth the price. and we enjoyed the service that our server provided very much, very detail oriented, just the right amount of talking.",4
Excellent all around. The steak prices are in line with the more upscale Steak Houses in Toronto. Service is excellent. Food was delicious. Great place for a special occasion. Highly recommend.,4
"The steak was terrible - ordered the Tamahawk 44oz with bone and there was no more than 9pz of edible meat on this cut of meat.  The asparagus was far too over steamed and the mushrooms & mashed potatoes, can‚Äôt really mess those up but they weren‚Äôt spectacular compared with the ambiance and expectations.

The service was sub-par, and very pushy on buying bottles of wine and always at the most expensive price point - very hard to catch up with my dining party when we were interrupted several times by ‚Äúhave you decided on a bottle of wine from my recommendations yet?‚Äù - candidly it felt a little too like a sales job, very pushy and no consideration for the point that everyone had different tastes in wine.  

When dinner concluded and it was clear we were done spending money, the entire wait staff disappeared and we were inconvenienced by having to track down our waitress for the bill.  Once the check was paid, another server dropped a fresh steak on our table which was quite odd.  

Overall, price for value does not hold at this restaurant - there are far better steakhouses in Toronto at this price point.  Ultimately a nice bar to have a cocktail, but it‚Äôs so far removed from the city that unless you‚Äôre close by, it‚Äôs not worth the trip.  My suggestion - teach your food buyers how to select a quality steak, nearly every person I speak with has the exact feedback ‚Äúgreat ambiance, terrible steak, too much money for the quality‚Äù - I‚Äôd do something  about this immediately - there are some great sources for quality steak in Toronto - improve from the kitchen out and then work on your waitstaff - they should compliment the dining experience, not make the experience feel like you‚Äôre buying a pair of shoes constantly looking to tack on an extra charge up item.  I‚Äôve traveled the world and experienced some fantastic steakhouses - this restaurant pales in comparison in all areas that count.",0
"Great food, great place. Special .   Very expensive.",4
"The steak was absolutely amazing, however the gnocchi was not tasty at all. In fact I ate it just to not be rude at that point. The bread and whatever the other stuff was wasn't good at all. Overall a great time, I would have chosen another side if I had the chance but other than that it was good. It was the most expensive dinner I've ever had and I didn't really feel like I got what I paid for at all.",4
"Amazing service and cuisine, as always! We always look forward to dining at Blueblood.",4
2nd best restaurant meal i have ever eaten. I want to come back and get a different menu item,4
Out server was great and the d√©cor was beautiful. The food was overpriced and underwhelming.,1
"The food was good (not fabulous), the atmosphere was good, I liked it
But, honestly, I felt our waiter was not engaged at all, I don't think he smiled once
Dining out at a restaurant should be ""an experience"", it wasn't memorable although our table had a great time together

Richard, who made our salad was awesome",2
"The food, ambiance and service was perfect, I would defiantly go again!!",4
Fantastic!,4
My husband and myself come to Blueblood for a celebratory retirement dinner. The whole experience was amazing. We had a fantastic night. Our waiter was superb. Very attentive and friendly.  The ambience was amazing and was very special and we will definitely come back,4
"The restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  The service was excellent. Informative and very polite.
I took my grandson who loves steak and he was extremely happy with his filet. I don‚Äôt eat red meat but found many items that I would enjoy.",4
The food was just not on par everything that came out we had to send back. The manager only came to speak with us after our meal was done offered to have us back for a free meal but didn‚Äôt takeoff anything on our bill. Very disappointing for such a beautiful restaurant.,1
"This was my second time going to this restaurant. I was there when it first openened and was not all that impressed so thought I would give it another shot.  Casa Loma is a beautiful setting so you won't be disappointed with that!  First time I sat in the dining room and this time in the bar, specifically ate at the bar.  I think that the steak at Harbour Sixty and Olivers(Oakville) owned by Michaels(Toronto) is far superior in flavor as are the salads and side dishes.   I feel that this restaurant is over priced for what you get.  I also felt that this particular night was super low key with atmosphere, did not really feel or hear any music (got there around 7:45 p.m.  and left by 10:45 p.m.)  Bar was empty and for a Saturday night I have to say pricey or not, I was surprised.",2
"I think my expectations were too high from a long period of anticipation tbd. Still, the dining room had drab light, our waiter seemed depressed, and it was $330 all in for good but not amazing steaks without even alcohol. It‚Äôs a great location and concept but I think a few tweaks must be made to charge 3x more than The Keg Mansion.",1
Awesome ambiance. The dining room is actually inside castle loma. Our waiter was outstanding. He gave us a history lesson on the castle and even on a tour and after our meal he took us downstairs to see the masive wine cellar. Needless to say the service was amazing and well beyond expectations. Food was also exceptional.,4
"Daughters birthday celebration. Beautiful atmosphere, expensive but special!",3
"From the moment we walked in, we were treated with outstanding service. Our server was very knowledgeable and made us very comfortable. The food was absolutely delicious. There are also options for those who don‚Äôt eat steak, such as salmon and chicken. Definitely would go again for our next special occasion.",4
"Cool European feel to the decor, but with a Canadian touch.  Beautiful inside and out.  Great service, great food.  Very pricey but worth it for a special occasion.",4
Excellent food and service. One of a time experience,4
"Went on Monday night for anniversary, not very busy. Great service, great food, great desert.",3
The food and service was great only prblem was they were unable to locate a proper infant chair even though we had put in a request on our reservation. They should keep them handy if they offer them as a request option!,3
"Have peanut allergy- Was told sarcastically there‚Äôs no peanuts in the ribeye steak...ok. Then upon ordering dessert was told that the kitchen is entirely peanut free... could have told me that from the beginning vs being a jerk over a serious condition. Also they forgot to bring bread and ceviche that we ordered. 

Other than that, the steakhouse is beautiful inside. Steaks were cooked perfectly. It‚Äôs a shame a potentially amazing experience was ruined. Will opt for Jacobs next time.",1
Sophisticated atmosphere. Great place for special occasions or date night. A bit on the pricy side but well worth it for a 5 star venue.,4
"Absolutely brilliant! Who wouldn't want to dine in a castle? The interior is just divine, the food portions are the perfect amount, they accommodated us for a birthday and educated us on the menu. I'd 100% most definitely come back!",4
"Great experience, good food, great service, beautiful scenery",3
Beautiful restaurant with amazing service. Food is expensive and generally great (though French onion soup was a bit more watery and savory than expected). Table side Caesar (dressing made at the table) and steaks were stand-outs. Fun for a special occasion!,3
Steak is not grilled and very underwhelming - striploin taste was odd....ambiance terrific but meal didn‚Äôt match - glad we went after touring CasaRoma but wouldn‚Äôt choose to go back.,1
"Has to be the best steakhouse in Ontario. 
Wagyu steaks are phenomenal and the service is impeccable. The fact that it‚Äôs located in the Castle Lomas is a PLUS. 
This place will not let you down!!!",4
The high quality Japanese Wagyu was absolutely delicious,4
"Great if you want to splurge, but too expensive for it's value.",2
"Great venue
Luxurious 
Great service
Pricey - wine markup is 3.5-4 times

Overall a great time- worth the spend",4
Service and food was excellent overall wonderful experience.,4
"First time at BlueBlood, very impressed with everything.
I do plan to go back on the next special occasion.",4
"Friendly servers who were conscientious, pleasant and friendly.",4
"Went to BlueBlood for New Years Eve. The steaks were exceptional, and the sides were good.  Our waiter, Costa, was attentive and recommended some specials, but we stuck with steakhouse classics. 

There was an event in the next room and the entire vibe was fun. 

Elegant and interesting setting within Casa Loma.

When I come back to Toronto, will definitely return to BlueBlood.",4
"Steak was great, sides lacked a bit of seasoning, server was very knowledgeable",2
"This was our first time at Casa Loma and it was beautiful.
Our sever CoCo was very informative about the menu and specials of the evening.
We will definitely be returning.",4
My husband and I went for my birthday and the ambiance was beautiful. Our waiter knew the menu well and the food was delicious. My only stipulation was that they charged us $6 pet slice to cut my birthday cake that we brought in. I've heard of a corking fee but I thought that was a little ridiculous.,3
"Our New Years Eve dinner at Casa Loma‚Äôs BlueBlood restaurant was absolutely wonderful in every way! Being offered a friendly escort with umbrellas up the magically lit walkway, receiving another warm, welcome greeting entering the restaurant, enjoying the beautiful setting in the exquisite historical space with it‚Äôs breathtaking architecture, relaxing in the lovely cozy ambience, being looked after by all the well appointed amazing staff, with a special thanks to Matt & our incredibly gracious waiter Richard who went above & beyond to ensure that our experience was fabulous.
Last but certainly not least, the food was fantastic - the steak, the best we have ever enjoyed. Plus, champagne butter with gold flakes! Beautiful touch for New Years Eve!
Thank you everyone for a night we will treasure the rest of our lives.
It meant so much.",4
"Service was not why I would expect for what was supposed to be a high end dinner experience.  We were seated right beside the bar with our 2 children and could not even hear each other speak over the shaking of drinks being mixed by the bartender.  Food was strictly average and nowhere near as good as Harbour 60, Hys or Morton‚Äôs.  Our server basically ignored us and only came back once for drink refills. We were 4 people - parents and 2 teenage children and one of the children had a salad for her meal as she is vegetarian and we had 3 alcoholic beverages and the lowest priced steaks on the menu and our bill including tip was over $800. Very odd atmosphere with the couples seated on either side of us making out throughout our entire meal.  We could not get out of there fast enough. Not a place for teenage children and not anywhere I would recommend or return.",0
"The ambience is nice as it is inside the castle.  We are lucky to go at this time with all the Christmas decorations and lights in the castle.  We had a quick enjoyment to walk around and took some pictures between appetizer and main.  When the restaurant was full, it was a bit noisy at first but died down when people left later in the night.  Variety of food in the menu is good.  Price reasonable for a high scale restaurant like this. Service excellent.  I loved the crispy kale.  Bread goes with not just olive oil but truffle oil.  Steak is done as ordered medium rare. For dessert you got to try the baked Alaska.  The way the server made it is interesting just to watch.  Tastes good too.  Overall, good experience.",4
"It was a nice dinner, the server was great.  The sommelier was not at all attentive.  knowledgeable for sure, but she seemed much more focused on large tables, than a party of 2",3
"Service was fine. Somewhat inattentive. I have no issue spending this much money ($350 pp incl drinks) if the meal is good. I‚Äôve had better steaks at the keg. Many times. One of the steaks served to us was literally 30%  sinew and connective tissue. All of them were under seasoned. The ‚Äúbearnaise‚Äù was embarrassing. The lobster Mac and cheese was amateurishly grainy. The crab legs were over cooked to the point of massacre, perhaps  in an unsuccessful attempt to try and hide their age. 

Nine of this led to any reduction on the bill. 

This place is all (attempted) style over substance.",1
Best steak I‚Äôve ever had,4
Lovely!!! Beautiful castle. Food was spot on. Spring for the waygu. Don‚Äôt miss the carpaccio.,4
"Was for birthday, was excellent and service from Sergio and the team was great.  Made for a great birthday.",4
Sergio the server was awesome!,4
"The food here is incredible! However, not impressed with the service at all. Took time to get our cocktails and then the waiter presumed we were not getting wine and took our glasses away. As we were still waiting on our cocktails a different waiter came to take our order and was not very helpful at all. Although polite, he seemed very disinterested and for first timers at the restaurant would have appreciated a walk through of the meat selection. My partner instead had to probe him with questions instead - which is something the waiter should do when you seem unsure. Had to ask for the bill twice before waiter actually brought it over.",3
"A most disappointing experience.  For a high priced steak house, our steak was fatty, with little taste and tough.  We did not eat half our steaks....they were that bad.   While the service was friendly, one of our guests ordered a Caesar Salad (very good but $40.00 good?) as an appetizer and then ordered crab cakes as a main course.  She was very clear to the waiter of the order, yet the crab cakes arrived before the Caesar had even been made.  Finally, we tried to book reservations a week in advance and was told we could only go on a wait list, but never heard back.  We did however get reservations through a separate online process, so tables were available.  Upon arrival and throughout our stay two tables for two and one table for four remained empty, so the restaurant was fair from sold out.  As I said a very disappointing experience.  As lovers of food experiences in Toronto, this one ranked near or at the bottom.",1
"Great food but, expected more for the price.  Mark ups too high, especially for alcohol.",3
"Loved it for the experience of dining in a castle and feeling mega special throughout! Food is standard- delish, but the room (and the building itself) is the star. Love the commissioned pair of Mr. Brainwash portraits that hang in the main dining room: Prince and Queen Elizabeth adding to to send of royalty. Great for special events or having something worth celebrating.",4
Amazing. Excellent food. Impeccable service. Decorated for the holidays. Gorgeous.,4
"Food was amazing. Tuna tartare, oysters, krispy kale chips, and of course the steak. The staff was phenomenal! Amazing service. Will definitely return and would highly recommend",4
"We were about 15 minutes early for our 5pm reservation and the gate to the restaurant was locked. We had to wait outside in sub zero temperatures for 15 mins. We walked to another entrance because we couldn‚Äôt handle the extreme cold however we were told we cannot wait inside, and must wait outside. The food and service were excellent however I would not recommend visiting this restaurant when the weather is poor as there is no shelter from the elements (cold, rain ect) while you wait for your table.",2
Good place to dine.,3
"Was pricey but average for a steak house and when you add the whole ombience of the castle, it was def worth spending the money there, than another steak house. You pay for the good food AND the experience. Service was Incredible! I‚Äôd recommend and def go back for a special occasion.",4
"We were there for our Anniversary and it was magical!! We went on Dec. 22. our anniversary is the 21st., besides the restaurant being absolutely gorgeous the inside of Casa Loma was all decorated for Christmas. You could not duplicate the atmosphere.
It was magnificent.
Our server was attentive but did not rush us in any way. We also took our married sons and their wives with
us so it was a special family time also. They also are well acquainted with Toronto's restaurant scene and felt the same way we did about the night. Food was excellent with a wide assortment of craft cocktails.
For the six of us it was $1,200 with tip. Not something you would do everyday but we will definitely return.
The only thing that was a little off putting was the washrooms and where they are located. The restaurant doesn't have it's own they share with all of the people who tour Casa Loma.",4
Great service!  Staff went out of there way to make our family Christmas dinner special.,4
My wife went with her sister. No issues with anything that night. Everything met their expectations and they would go again.,4
"Our server was not attentive at all. We waited very, very long for drinks and had to remind him several times. He also forgot to order some food items. Was disappointed. For that price, the service should be top notch.",2
Thumbs down.  Read the negative reviews on google .  They are all true.  Not even wasting another second of my life here.  Need new cook team and chefs guys!  For what you are charging .,1
"For the second year in a row, we celebrated my wife‚Äôs birthday. The atmosphere is very interesting and has a great vibe. Last year we did not find the food to be that great, but this year everything (steaks, sides, desserts) were all excellent. Still very pricey but happy we gave it another try.",4
"Second time here and was placed in the bar area and not the oak wood room. Changes the vibe a bit. This time I ordered the bone in strip and it was smaller than the bone out one my co worker got and his was supposed to be a smaller steak. 

Sides were good but nothing special this time around. It‚Äôs overpriced for what you get but you are eating in a castle. So there is something to be said about that. 

I would probably go somewhere else unless I was looking to offer a unique dining experience. But for every day or even special occasions I wouldn‚Äôt make it a return spot. 

If it‚Äôs your first time the do it and enjoy it. But don‚Äôt make it a repeat experience.",3
"We really enjoyed  our dining experience.  
I did let the hostess and door men know about some extremely inebriated men that bumped into me and I asked to make sure that they were not driving that night. 
Thanks - we will be back! üí´",4
"Go to the Keg, you'll get a better steak for 20% of the price.
Wait staff is very good, wine list is good and the facility is excellent, just don't dine there.

The noise level made it impossible to carry on a conversation across the table.

Thanks to the Manager for offering seating at the Orchestra playing next door in the castle as compensation for the issues.",1
Very nice steak house with premium quality food and ambiance. Service was excellent.,4
The absolute worst service I‚Äôve,1
"We were celebrating my husbands birthday.   It was a lovely evening, beautiful room,  great food and pricy but a good time had by all!!",4
Great food and great ambience.,4
"This is our 2nd visit to BlueBlood Steakhouse and once again the food is out of this world and so delicious. It is an expensive restaurant, but worth every penny if you are celebrating a birthday or anniversary. They really try to make food into a work of art. We especially loved the tableside Baked Alaska show for dessert. Thank you BlueBlood for making my hubbies birthday a memorable one:)",4
Service was good.,4
Looking to ball out for Instagram pics? This is the place. Service and food don't hold par to the price.,2
Wonderful dinner.  Great atmosphere and d√©cor.  creative menu.  party of 6 was very happy,4
Great food but horrible service! Waited 20 min for our first drinks. Our apps came out and we still didn‚Äôt have our drinks. 1 bartender for the whole restaurant. Had to pre order drinks to ensure we had them at the table with our meal.,2
"We had a wonderful night 
We would recommend Bluebloods to friends and go back ourselves
Thank you",4
Great we also go by ourselves we enjoy it.,4
"Lovely atmosphere, but the food was not worth the price.",2
"Can get much better quantity and quality for less than half the price at many other restaurants. Nice service and atmosphere but nothing special. Would consider it alright overall, just not up to the standard it strives for.",1
"Table was not ready on time
Drinks took forever
Food was bland",0
"Blue Blood has become our neighbourhood go-to for family celebrations.  Beautiful decor, wonderful cocktails and good food.",4
"We had a wonderful evening at Blue Bloods last week.  The staff were extremely knowledgeable and attentive, and the food was beyond our expectations",4
Loved it. The food and service was excellent. We will definitely be back.,4
"A beautiful restaurant located in a gorgeous historical site. The seating was comfortable albeit tight, and lacking privacy. And overall we found it to be grossly overpriced. 
While the food was indeed very tasty, it did not justify the cost associated with it.
Our wait-staff were pleasant and attentive, And certainly kept our water glasses filled. If only we‚Äôd know we were being charged $7.50 per bottle of water...To be fair, we ordered still water as I do not care for carbonated options. But I incorrectly assumed I would be receiving regular water.
And while the side dishes are charged separately, they were lovely. However, $20.00 for a single large double baked potato seemed excessive.
$27.00 for a 5 oz glass of red wine ended the over-priced affair for us.
I cannot say I would return, or infact recommend the restaurant for even the most special of occasions.
There are far more options for special occasions in the city, with the same ambiance and quality of food.",1
"Our waiter was outstanding. Unfortunately, we‚Äôve forgotten his name, as we were enjoying or night so much, but if you can find out who served us that night (James Chabot reservation) please give him our thanks. Was a perfect night.",4
"Service was over the top. Casa Loma was stunning this time of year. 
Unfortunately the quality of the food doesn‚Äôt hold its value. 
The price was to be expected no shock in that department.the steaks were very average at best (being kind). Doesn‚Äôt hold a candle to the other high end steak houses in this city. 
But the service was second to none",1
"Melt in your mouth steaks and delicious wedge salads.
Our wait staff, Taavo, was very knowledgeable, personable and attentive.",4
I loved the service I received and would definitely be going back there for the full blue blood experience.,4
Always an absolute pleasure going there. Adi will you always show such respect you are a true gentleman and you always take care of us and it doesn't go unnoticed. Sat night was a very special night for us and you make sure that it was even more special and I thank you again AND THIS IS WHY I HAVE BEEN COMING THERE SINCE OPENING.. Nick it's very very lucky to have such a professional person on his team,4
"Celebrating a number of things two birthdays most importantly!
Dinner for six food was amazing Sommelier wine pics were 
Just what we wanted 
Our server Jenny was great and very attentive 
All in all would definitely come back
Beautiful decor and Casa Loma is very festive st the time of year",4
Amazing service. Everything was AMAZINGüòä,4
"The service was brutal.  It took an hour before we were seated and served bread. The apps took a long time to arrive and then the mains were served quickly after our first course.  One of the sides was sent back for being cold and did not get served until the meal was basically finished.  To end, all four of us ordered an after dinner drink at the same time.  The first two were served and consumed before the other couple received there‚Äôs.   Start to finish, the timing was pathetic for a $1000 meal",2
"Reservations for Birthday dinner.  
The service was fabulous and attentive. Very knowledgeable staff and catered to all of our needs without hesitation.    
Food was just spectacular.  
We have been here before, and will always come back. 

Thank you to everyone at Blueblood.",4
"It's my third time coming here. I brought my parents here to enjoy the atmosphere and the good food but this time is very disappointing because our wait or Anthony is very NOT attentative to our table AT ALL and made our experience very uncomfortable that night. the manager talked to me and apologize for him I appreciate that but still 
what's done is done. Very bad and very disappointing!",0
Amazing one of my fav restaurants in Toronto! Service is outstanding the entire team is friendly and very knowledgeable,4
"The choice of meats is abundant and actually pretty qualitative - that is, provided you want to spend $100-$400 on a decently sized steak. Starches and sides were exquisite - their truffled mashed is a must-try. They also propose a variety of more standard entrees so you can actually pick and choose,
Service was pretty good, very professional and careful. However it took an extraordinarily long time for us to get our meat, despite a room more than half-empty. Couldn't shake off the impression that they want you to drink a full bottle before you actually get to eat...
I mainly came for the stellar choice of wines they boast on their website - but I was severely disappointed by the actual choice, which is far more restrictive. It is also quite expensive, being veered towards aged, high-end (hence overpriced) wines. There is no strong choice on the low-to-middle price range.",3
"Food was priced too high for what it was. Nice atmosphere. Service was fine not bad just not at the level it should be at this expensive of a restaurant. I would go back but only for drinks and appetizers. In Toronto, you could have a really nice meal for $1000 for 2 couples. This was a good one just not at the level to ask those prices.",2
This place is outstanding! Awesome place for celebration dinner.,4
I expected top tier service and top tier food and that is exactly what I got. I will definitely come back for another special occasion :),4
The service was exceptional.,3
"After dinner we moved to the cocktail room . We sitted at the bar . This girl was making our drink she was very rude . Didn‚Äôt want tell the drink at all .... this guy bartender also stood there kept asking if they can go on dates . We were really annoying by them talking 10 mins no stop . We tried take pics of the smoke drink old fashion we ordered and she didn‚Äôt even want do it in front us .... she said she will bring to us after she done in the corner .... 
last time we were there another bartender super nice he did a performance to the same drink ! And introduced us this drink very nicely .....",4
"We went to celebrate a birthday. Having dinner in a castle was unique. The service was friendly and efficient. It was great to be in a restaurant where we could actually have a conversation. The food was first class. I have never tasted a hamburger as good as the one I was served. My guest ordered the rib which was equally as good.
The portions are huge and well presented. We ended up taking food home. It was packaged for us and presented at the table in a Casa Loma cloth bag. Class act. We'll be back.",4
"I enjoyed very much the dinner ! 
The place was very elegant and the service was really goooooddd!!!! 
I will come back for sure
All the very best,
Patricia and Juan Aguirre",4
"Nice restuarant, great table and service was excellent but overpriced. Had to send steak back as it was undercooked, sides are very small. Excellent caeser salad. Lastly, had to pay $10 to park my own car which is ridiculous when visiting a high end restuarant.",3
"Steak was perfectly cooked, garlic mashed potatoes were delicious.  The only thing I would say is that the Kale salad was a big dry, needed more dressing and salt.  Wait staff were professional and accommodating.   Thank you for making our anniversary a special one.",4
"The best way to describe this place is it's like a fancy Keg. We weren't too impressed by the food (our steaks came warm, turning cold before we were half way through), or the service when compared to other high end steakhouses. The markup on wine at BlueBlood was absolutely ridiculous!!! To compare, a bottle of Caymus Cab. is almost $900 at BlueBlood - while the LCBO sells it for just over $110. Other restaurants sell the same wine for under $400! We definitely won't be going back to BlueBlood",2
"It is amazing, nice ambiance.
Class and Royal.
The idea of doing some foods in front of you is interesting",4
We had an amazing server and the experience overall was fantastic! The food was really good but the quality was not indicative of the cost. Noise level and ambiance were perfect. Would return on business or special occasion.,3
"Terrible service 
Bad desserts (pre made)
Bad steak tar tar (very bland) when I did t finish the waitress asked if I wanted to take it to go. That‚Äôs right raw meat to go. Terrible staff. 


Steak was good 
Sauces were great",1
"From all steak houses that I visited, this one takes the cake with its ambience and nostalgia. Plus the fact its in a castle setting is great. My girlfriend was impressed with it all, from presentation, server and food. Will be returning in the summer for the tomahawk..lol.",4
"Great service and ambiance. Our attendant was the real MVP, he was very informative on every item in the menu which made our choices a lot easier. The food was delicious. The cocktails were memorable, with the right amount of panache.",3
"Our Waiter Costa, seemed a little impatient serving a party of 7. Maybe he is not used to serving such large parties but he definitely could have done better.",2
Best steak ever. It was so flavourful. The server was so knowledgeable as well.,4
Unique experience! Food great but ambience blew us away!,4
"We went here for my husbands 33rd birthday. The atmosphere is cool.. we ate in the oak room and it was beautiful.  The cocktails are great-once upon a time comes served w smoke.  dessert too, we ordered profiteroles and they were delicious. The actual food though is underwhelming, the keg is better! The steak was over done and not flavourful, the sides were weak. After tax and tip our tab was $480 and we didn‚Äôt even go wild with our order.. 12 oysters, shared a larger steak, 2 sides, a bottle of wine and a couple cocktails and a dessert that I don‚Äôt think was complimentary even though we were celebrating a birthday. The crowd gets super sleazy after 10pm.  Not worth the money.... I felt ripped off. I don‚Äôt recommend this restaurant and I won‚Äôt go back.",2
"Overall a great experience. Servers and hosts were attentive and polite. The drinks list is on an iPad, which I specifically enjoyed for ordering wine because it allowed for in-depth descriptions to accompany each wine that outlined its flavour profile, origin, etc. 
I had a kale salad to start that was absolutely delicious, but the star was obviously the Wagyu filet mignon, which was so soft and tender, it made me want to stop talking and just focus on savouring each bite! Would recommend for sure.",4
"We had the french onion soup and scallop ceviche to start. French onion soup was good nothing too special. Scallop ceviche was delicious, very flavourful. For mains we had steak and the jumbo scallops both cooked perfectly and very tasty! Had the mushrooms as a side which was so meaty we were too full to finish it. Dessert was just ok, nothing special we had the trio. Service was excellent.",4
The ambiance is absolutely breathtaking & the food never disappoints. Adi & the team go above & beyond to make sure every visit is special. Make sure to ask the somm for a tour of the wine cellar!,4
"Food was amazing. Amazing staff members, impressive.",4
There was a mix up with the reservation and the front hostess was quite rude. But when I spoke to the manager he was very understanding and accommodating. They sorted out our issue and we had a great night. Food was great and our waiter was great. Sometimes how you resolve an issue is what sets you above other establishments and I would definitely recommend eating here,4
"Room is gorgeous.  Staff wax excellent and tried hard to give great service
Waited 20 minutes for my cocktail 
3 of 4 appetizers were sent back as they were not good
Steak was fine but it‚Äôs not Jacobs
Definitely would not go back. Food not up to the prices",2
Enjoyed the ambiance!  We had an early reservation so it what pretty quiet when we arrived.  Fun cocktail menu and good food.  Can‚Äôt wait to go back!,3
"Other then the high price tag, everything here was just excellent.",4
"The venue is beautiful and service professional. Steaks are great but not the best. The salad was a great disappointment. For those prices, they need to step up their game.",3
"Server Kosta was amazing, knowledgeable and sensitive to our group dynamics!",4
"Excellent food and service  , really enjoyed date night there . Service was excellent .",4
"Our night at BlueBlood was exceptional. Our service was fantastic and the food was super quick and not to mention, absolutely delicious. It was my fianc√©'s birthday and Blueblood gave a card and a little gift. Would definitely go back again!",4
"Don‚Äôt have the Cornish Hen. Cooked from frozen. Bad. Lots of better choices. Seafood tower lovely. Caesar salad not made at side of table (too vinegar). Go to Hy‚Äôs for that because it is the very best. Reached out to BlueBlood for an explanation on some of the disappointments, but I haven‚Äôt heard back. Lovely atmosphere and venue (Casa Loma), but don‚Äôt fall for just that. My entree of scallops was excellent. Truffle mashed potatoes: so, so.  Bathrooms are a hike and are open to all. Not single gendered. Likely won‚Äôt return. My tried and true are Hy‚Äôs in Toronto and 17 Steakhouse in Mississauga-both TOP NOTCH.",2
Food was way overpriced. $80 for table side Caesar salad?,2
"Outstanding food, amazing ambience and excellent service! We will be back!",4
Lovely place to have a calm meal. Food is amazing. Servers/staff are very polite and welcoming. Highly recommend!,3
"Parking situation was horrible, but other than that, superior food and service otherwise.",4
"Simply Brilliant...! 
This was our first time at the restaurant and we enjoyed every second. Moreover,The staff was amazing and the quality of the food, impeccable!! For me also, this was an very special night, given the fact that I proposed to my fianc√© right after our dinner at the front door.

If you want to have an amazing experience with great food and Class A service, then Blueblood Steakhouse is your place!",4
"The place was very nice and has the cool factor being in Castle Loma.  However the food was disappointing.  My husband ordered a 12 oz cdn steak for $65 and couldn‚Äôt even finish eating it cause it‚Äôs taste was far from superb for being at a steakhouse.  Prices are expensive for what you get.       The service was very average.  I was happy to see it and try it out, but was expecting much more for what we ended up paying and the caliber of restaurant it is competing with.",2
"Celebrated our daughter's birthday on Sunday.  The venue, the service was outstanding.  The food was cooked perfectly and our waiter(s) were knowledgeable and very friendly.  Will definitely be back!  Thank you for making our occasion very special.  -Mary and Marc",4
Excellent service from the moment we walked in. Our waiter was very well mannered and very good at his job made sure we were taken care of. Will definitely be back again to dine,4
"Service was fabulous. It was remembered that it was a special occasion (my husbands birthday). He received a card, a gift and a candle on his dessert. That was special.",4
"I came to BlueBlood to celebrate two birthdays and the evening was perfect. 

I cannot afford to eat here on the regular, but it was a wonderful experience, and exceeded my expectations.
Our server was first class!",4
"Excellent place to dine.. Food was amazing, i would recommend all of Canada to this awesome place... I would dine here a million times more it was a breath taking experience. The staff was fantastic, they welcome you beyond expectations not to mention the waiter I had OMG! I felt really welcomed... The experience was everything! Keep up the good job",4
The food was amazing! Amazing ambiance! The only thing that my family was not happy was the assigned waiter. We felt that he was rude and arrogant.,3
The service and ambience was absolutely amazing. The food was okay. All the staff were lovely.,3
"The quality of the food and the service are first-rate. The items on the menu are pricey, but this is to be expected from a high-end steak restaurant. The venue (Casa Loma) is one-of-a-kind.",4
"the food definitely not worth the price.
steakhouse`s allways serve their steak with sides and this place charges additional (some ridiculous prices).",0
"It was our first time to BlueBlood, and it was for my fiance's birthday. They treated us very well. A surprise card and gift were waiting for us. Although I found the final bill to be pricey. It was worth it for the experience of the restaurant and lavish food. A perfect spot for special occasions.",4
"Geweldige locatie en ambiance. 
Ruime menu kaart voor ieder wat wils. 
Kwaliteit waa onberispelijk. Vooral de huisgemaakte uiensoep. 
Hebben er de dag er na gelijk weer geboekt.",4
We thoroughly enjoyed the experience at BlueBlood's and would recommend it highly for special occasions.,4
"My partner and I had a great dinner experience and would definitely recommend others to book here for special occasions. The only feedback I have is that no one offered to take my coat at the door and that it was incredibly difficult to hear the servers and my date. 

Our server was friendly and very knowledgeable. Even when my order did not come out correctly, he followed-up immediately and offered us complimentary desserts. That was appreciated.",4
"It is a very nice restaurant inside Casa Loma. Food and Service are top class. Our staeks were juicy and very tasty. Maitre and waiter were very attentive and servicial. Maitre offered us to go to bar to have deseert and know other room of the restaurant. Cost is high,but worthy.  Only complaint was not being seated in the Oak room, which is the most elegant one.",3
Service was just outstanding. Very nice ambience and food was delicious.,4
My second time there. Service wasn‚Äôt as attentive and the food wasn‚Äôt as tasty. A bit disappointing as we loved it the first time.,2
Staff was very welcoming  and food  was excellent.,3
"It took an exceptionally long time to get our food.  My friends and I ate the bread the whole time we waited for the meal and when it was time to have our dinner, was too full to enjoy my food.  This restaurant came recommended, however, after this experience I will not go back.  It is a very expensive restaurant and think there should have been more consideration to the customer and my friends.  Food was very nice (burger), but unfortunately again the wait time was so excessive denying the wonderful experience I had hoped for.",1
"Beautiful location, the food was excellent, all staff we came in contact with were exceptional... $$$$ but worth it.",4
Everything from the service to the food was just exquisite! Really fancy and such a wonderful experience; it truly was. Thank you to all at Blueblood for making this experience so enjoyable!,4
"We enjoyed a lovely dinner with excellent service. Our only complaint would be the ‚Äòcorner‚Äô style chairs were not really comfortable and the tables for two are a little small, we felt a bit cramped in. However the food was very good, especially the caesar salad which is made table-side. Perfect for a special occasion.",4
"Great food and great venue. Will be back. Great for Birthdays, cocktails etc..",4
"We went for my husband's Birthday. The ladies at the front desk barely smile and didn‚Äôt ask to take our coats. The tuna tartarre was missing salt and was just ok. The Caesar salad was great. Husband ordered a very expensive steak the wagyu and it was sooooo salty. He mentioned it to the server who came back and said the chef said it was cooked fine and is flavourful. Ummm... ok.. Not what you expect for the price of steak you pay! Poor hubby barely ate his steak. My prime rib was good. We also ordered mushroom side dish and for $16 you get like 2 pieces of mushrooms NOT WORTH the steep price. When I made the reservation I mentioned that it was his birthday, we were seated in the middle room where there‚Äôs a few other tables. No decor no ambiance just a plain boring room. Why even seat guests in that space? I wanted to take him to the restaurant for the ambiance and the decor and all as I heard it‚Äôs a beautiful restaurant. I was so disappointed in that. I recommend you ask them first where you‚Äôll be seated when making a reservation! You do not want to be seated in that middle section!! Overall, for a night that cost $600 the steak was so disappointing yet the response/feedback was even worse! The room where we sat was boring and the fact that our coats were just hanging on the bench and nobody bothered to ask us to put it away underwhelmed the experience. There was a nice touch that he was given a card and a little gift for his birthday. However, i would still not return and I would not recommend this restaurant. For that price you can have an amazing experience elsewhere with great service, steak that is edible and not full of salt, your coat taken care of and at least in an interesting room to dine in unlike our experience at BlueBlood.",1
"I had the best time ever at Blueblood. I celebrated my birthday with a few friends and the experience, atomsphere, but most of all the service was outstanding. I had an AMAZING time. Thank you to the entire team for everything. A birthday I‚Äôll never forget. One for the books!",4
We had a wonderful birthday celebration at BlueBlood. The food is delicious and service impeccable.,3
Just love this spot ! Food is amazing and your in the most beautiful castle in Toronto. Great art as well... my favorite new spot ! Love the bar area for dining .,4
"food‚Äôs good quality, a little pricy but really good ambiance.",3
I just want to take a minute to first thank chris the CEO. For taking time out of his busy evening to give myself and my lovely girlfriend a tour of the castle. The staff as a hole were amazing such a amazing wonderful experience. Food was perfect. Very nice presentation and very very clean.. thank everyone from parking to door man to servers. Everyone for making our experience amazing.... Jeff and alexü•Çü•Ç,4
"The manager, Sergio and the team including reception were outstanding. They made our night anniversary with my teenager son, memorable. Food excellent so the wine list and the ambiance! Just stellar!! Millions of thanks! We will be back!!",4
The best food we ever had and would definitely go again,4
"We were very unhappy with the service at what we thought was going to be an upscale restaurant where we were celebrating my niece ‚Äòs 50 Birthday.
The service was very slow in clearing our plates and we waited so long for our dessert that we chose to cancel our order.
A huge disappointment on what we were hoping would have been a great evening.",2
"I have been twice at the Blueblood restaurant, once for my husbands birthday and we had a very pleasent meal. Quality food and service.
The second time I took a friend and I decided to try the bar just for a relaxed drink before dinner, the experience was excellent as being located in Casa Loma makes the surroundings very special. Unfortunately when we went to the Retaurant for our dinner midway into our main course a group of very loud men came in and totally spoiled our dinner. It took the restaurant management too long to bring to their attention that it doesn‚Äôt matter how much money they had, Casa Loma is not a pub or a local bar. I will go again as I just love the decor and the food but if this happens again, I will not spend an average of 500 CAD to have my dinner ruined by spoiled prats.",3
"The setting for blue blood in casa loma is spectacular and it is very well fit out.
The starters of steak tartare served in a bone as well as the Caesar salad prepared table side were both excellent.

Unfortunately the dinner was let down by the 35 day dry aged striploin which was quite tough and had an unpleasant flavour - Very disappointing for a steak restaurant! The waiter and manager handled this adequately but not particularly apologetically, we didn‚Äôt want to make a fuss at all but they didn‚Äôt charge us for the steak.
We did notice the couple next to us also sent back both their seabass and steak.

Up until the steak we would have given the restaurant 5 stars so it was unfortunate that it was such a disappointment.",2
"As a group of 6 is apparently impossible in the Oak Room, the nicest one, (something we had not been made aware of at time of reservation or confirmation) we were put in the Billiard Room (not as nice as Oak Room or bar) with another large group of maybe 12 and two tables of 2. Noisy and right by kitchen door in plain view, cloak room, no linen on table. 

Food was ok but, honestly, much better at The Keg. Cesar Salad way too garlicky or mustardy, Chopped Salad, steaks and side ordinary. 

Very good service from our waiter and appreciated the little attention to the birthday girls. 

Too pricey and slightly gimmicky for what it was, unfortunately.",2
A truly amazing meal. Waygu beef was perfect. Can‚Äôt wait to return,4
Great setting with superb service. The meal was excellent,4
Upscale dining experience with everything you would expect and more!,4
Nice touch to get the wine stopper as a gift.,4
"Food - the steak was very good but the truffle mashed potato side dish was somewhat flavourless
Wine - the Sommelier was excellent, great wine list
Service - although each server was attentive, the choreography was very disjointed, with multiple servers tending to our table, resulting in drinks being late in arriving and one of our food orders not showing up until the main course was done. Very disappointing at this price point!!!",2
The service was outstanding. The food was great. Really cool place.,4
Amazing food and amazing service! Definitely recommend this restaurant.,4
"First and foremost, THANK YOU JENNY. Our ‚Äòhostess/waitress‚Äô went very high and beyond, I was in awe the whole time. The service was impeccable!

The ambience is spectacular, the food presentation - breathtaking. Thank you for making my husband‚Äôs birthday truly special.

I‚Äôm definitely coming back but this time with my ‚ÄòFoodExplorer Friends‚Äô

Thank You!",4
"After hearing great reviews from my clients, I saved my money to a few months to host my friends birthday dinner there and I didn‚Äôt seem to feel like
I got value out of our diner.",0
"This food was not worth the price, the service was impeccable however it‚Äôs was not up there with the greats such as a Ruth Chris, harbour 60 or Jacobs. $600 later and completely disappointed",0
Great food!  Lovely room. Great service. One of the best steaks in Toronto.,4
"Everything was great, but the kitchen service was very slow. It took over 40 minutes to get our appetizers, with a subsequent 30 minute wait for our main course.",4
Celebrated my daughter‚Äôs birthday and the staff made it a very memorable event,4
"We loved every minute of our time at BlueBlood
Quite enchanting and quintessential Steak House atmosphere 
Definitely a place to celebrate important occasions
The service was top notch
Great wine suggestions from the sommelier 
We will return for sure , can‚Äôt wait",4
Loved it! Amazing service and amazing food. Will definitely go back.,4
Food wasn't as good as I expected but the service and the ambiance was outstanding.  It was perfect for the special occasion we were having and the staff even gave us a memento to remember the occasion,3
"Went above and beyond with their service. 

All servers explained everything to the point",4
The server we had. I forget his name. Very good. Actually every last server was top of the line exceptional. Best restaurant service in all of my life,4
Overall great place but service could have been better. Our waiter had a big table to attend and we felt ignored.,4
"Excellent overall, but I would rather had a nicer room to dine in. Also, this restaurant was supposed to be""upscale"" with a dress code but the tiny bland room where I was seated had guests in t-shirts.",2
Excellent food/excellent location -pricey-so once in a while use for me,4
"Been to the restaurant several times, the service is always excellent. Food tasted good, especially the tomahawk cut, which was outstanding. Though I don't seem to find any other dish specially memorable, but doesn't mean they're not good. Just doesn't stand out anymore. Either or, you're having great service and good steak in a friggin castle, can't go wrong.",4
Phenomenal meal.  Great spot to start a bachelor party.  Amazing steaks!,4
"Everything was great. The only thing I would suggest is installing window blinds. I'm sure the AC was on, however most people found it warn inside. Not too comfortable. Thanks.",4
"It was an excellent experience! 
The food, the wine, the service, the dinning atmosphere üíï everything was just perfect! 
Big recommendation for special occasions!",4
Other than the hostess being pretentious this place was fine. Beautiful ambience and good food. Lots of wait staff. Would recommend a reservation.,2
Both rooms are beautiful and Excellent service and food.,4
The food is very good. steaks are strong and table side caesar is really good. portions are huge. Service is unique and amazing. Whoever trained their staff knows what's up,4
"I was disappointed to have been sat in the bar area when there was lots of tables in other dining areas.
I made this reservation a few months in advance as it was a special anniversary of where we were married 32 years ago, so I would have hope that we would have been given a nice table. Not so, I faced the kitchen in the bar area and was squished against the table. We spent over 600.00 so not a value for money spent. Treat your customers better especially when they were married there and spent a lot then! The waiter was pushy but the other staff were great. Still a beautiful place.",2
"Prices are sky-high, be we knew that. Personally, I‚Äôd take any other big steak house in Toronto over this one.",2
Quite fancy in the stunning Casa Loma location. Pricey but service and food are worth this special occasion place. Made my daughter‚Äôs 10th birthday truly an event to remember.,3
"The food was good, the service was good but quite an impersonal. Prices are about 25% higher than is  merited by the food and service consequently value for money is on the low side. There was nothing about it that would have me rushing back here.",2
"Being located in Casa Loma, the venue is fantastic, the service was absolutely outstanding and the food, even though pricy, was very good! I had less luck on another visit but they got their act together and made our dinner an outstanding experience. We will be back for sure.",4
"I had heard mixed reviews on the restaurant, but decided to give it a try.  I eat at steakhouses in Toronto all the time, so in some ways consider myself a quasi expert.  I am not in any way tight with money, and any reference to cost is related to value for the money.  In point form, my review is as follows:

- cocktails and wine by the glass were immediately noticed as being skimpy in quantity for the price
-  overall a rib steak for $100 was excessively priced especially considering how much fat was cut off which was also excessive  
-asked for steak spice as I thought the steak was a bit bland in flavour which they gladly provided at a price which I felt was excessive
- caesar salad made at table was good and probably a big seller, but too much lemon which overpowered the salad which was anticipated to be incredible

In short, kind of a disappointment from what I was expecting for the price point of the restaurant.  We won't be going back there.  We will stick gladly with our usual steak house haunts",1
"A very mediocre experience.  My wife had steak, which she said was great!  I had Salmon. Very Average.  The service disappointing. 

Fabulous ambience!!",2
"Great experience, food and service!! We had an amazing time!",4
"Sergio, our waiter was great!!!",4
Excellent Food and Service!:) They even gave us an anniversary gift which is so nice of them‚Äî considering my baby was so cranky the entire time..:p,4
Andy was great and knowledgeable and friendly his service is hard to find and appreciated and the manager there we didn‚Äôt catch his name but they both were awesome !,4
"Fantastic food and service. Overall it was quite expensive,  but for a special occasion it's a really nice place to treat yourself at.  Steaks are as good as Jacob's, maybe better.",3
"Dramatic setting, attentive albeit not well informed wait staff for the price of the food.  

Dramatically overpriced options wtib mediocre execution.  

You should never spend this much on average food.  Sides were uninspired - overseasoned and average.  And aside from the Wagyu Tasting - which was nicely prepared, tender and juicy the Tenderloin and Tomahowk rib steak were chalky and dry tasting even when prepared blue rare to medium rare. 

Can‚Äôt recommend - just pop your head in the check out the lovely appointed dining room and move on...",2
"Phenomenal service, great atmosphere, seafood tower, ceasar salad, duck fat french fries(WAY too thick) & A5 cuts of meat are all much better at Jacobs & co. We‚Äôre avid fine diners and I was hoping for more, my reservations for high end steak hiuse will remain with Jacobs.",3
"perfectly cooked steaks, others had seafooed (salmon, scallops) and they said it was very good.  Sides are large enough to split amongst two people.",4
Great service and excellent food. Pricey but worth it for a special occasion.,4
This was the BEST meal I have had in my whole entire life. The food was so full of taste and the service was impeccable! Amazing.,4
"Incredible table side service and great food. A bit pricey but worth it for the quality, ambience, and service! They offered 3 differently types of salt for your food, which was a really nice touch! Caesar salad was the best I've ever had and made fresh table side.",4
The restaurant was very beautiful but the food and service were poor.,1
"Wonderful and comfortable seating by windows (at least for us), wonderful staff and service, beautiful surroundings in Casa Loma.  Table side made ceasar salad was a fascinating experience with a wonderful server but didn't have enough dressing or parmesan shavings on it, croutons were hard as rocks.  Tomahawk steak at $180 was cooked as ordered but VERY tough and chewy and was low on flavor - what a shame.  Bearnaise sauce was incredible ($5) as were the woodland mushrooms ($16).  The sweet potato fries ($14) were good but with just a few, not worth $14 by any stretch of the imagination.  The highlight of the night was not the steaks but the profiteroles ($14)....OMG house made hazelnut ice cream surrounded by crunchy wafers and a soft chocolate dome with chocolate sauce poured all over.  HUGE portion and one of the most delicious and flavorful desserts I have had in years.  Some issues - server did not tell us the water was $8.50 a bottle and did not get our permission to open a second bottle for us - she just kept pouring even when our glasses were still near full.  Also when we were discussing to decide between the Bearnaise sauce and the peppercorn cognac, she brought both without our permission.  Not a big deal, but it seemed disrespectful an as if they were forcing things on you to add to the bill.  Add to this the fact that the restroom is literally a mile away and not easily accessible by my friend with a cane....the place is clearly discriminatory against those that have accessibility issues.  I can't see even those that can walk easily wanting to spend a part of their evening there walking that far to and from a restroom.",3
Best service ever!!!  Very good food.,4
Celebrated our wedding anniversary.  Food was amazing and the staff was super friendly and helpful.  Great experience!,4
i reserved a booth for my fiance and i. i was told that the restaurant could not honor it because it was a saturday. ok fine. we knew what we wanted but was unsure about the wine. the waiter disappear for 30 minutes. he comes back to order the food and is missing until the food arrives. the steaks here are enormous. do not order the scallops. it only comes in 4 bite size pieces. it was $39. no sides or anything. the wine by the glass was roughly about $20 each. the waiter is missing again. we finally get the check. we had to get the sommiler to get  the waiter. he comes back with chocolates. the chocolate was rich and we had no water to wash it down with. we ended up spending 400 for mediocre service.,2
"very disappointed noisy, lettuce wedge not satisfactory service okay up too  asking for 2 nd cup of coffee then waited 8 to 10 minutes left without getting coffee. would not recommend and will not return",0
"If you want to eat steak in a castle, this is the restaurant for you! If you want a top-tier Toronto Steakhouse this may not be the best option. The novel location doesn‚Äôt make up for the fruit flies, mosquitos, lack of air conditioning, & stale bread.",2
This was a FANTASTIC restaurant.  The food was incredible and the ambience was lovely.,4
"I make a better Tomahawk then they do. And it cost us $180 for it. I didn‚Äôt even have one decent bite from it. We mentioned it to our server, the matre‚Äôd and one other server and they ignored our feedback. The server simply said ‚Äòoh I would have ordered a porterhouse‚Äô. Second time there and it will be our last time. Especially since our bill ended up being over $1000 with tip.",2
"I know it's part of the season, but there were fruit flies in all areas of the restaurant. There was fresh fruit set out in bowls on the bar (where we started) which meant they were quite plentiful. There were fewer, but still some at each table. We had to cover our glasses with coasters.

The first seats we had were beautiful leather, but curved in such a way that you had to either scoot far off to one side or put your arm up on the side of the chair to cut your meat. We were moved to another table, but then seated very closely beside another set of diners.

Just an aesthetic thing, but the large picture of the Queen had what looked like graffiti on it (red script on top). I didn't feel it was really the right style for the rest of the decor. 

All that said, the food was delicious and my steak was cooked perfectly. Everything was served nice and hot.",3
"The restaurant has a very beautiful decor and exquisite setting being at Casa Loma.  From the time we were escorted from the parking lot walkway to our table, the service was pleasant and attentive! Our  appetizers and main dishes especially the cornish hen and mushrooms were delicious and uniquely presented. Scallops best ever!! As lovely as our experience was it was difficult to swallow the pricing. I would like to return however, sadly too heavy on the pocket book.",4
Worse steak i have ever had. The mac and cheese was also very bad. Will notgo back anymore,0
Much improved service and food over my first trip months ago where I did not give a great rating!  Highly recommend the Caesar salad made beside the table. Staff was much more attentive. Steak was great. Now I rank this with the other top steakhouses in Toronto.,4
"Everything single thing about this place is priceless - food, service, ambiance ............. 100 % on par.",4
"Amazing dinner and ambiance for my hubby‚Äôs 50th bday üéâ celebration!  We will be back with friends!  
Jiulia, Angelo & Adrian",4
Excellent Steakhouse in Casa Loma! The ambiance of dining in the castle setting of Casa Loma was truly special! The charming decor and artwork was memorable! The meal was spectacular in every respect.  Steak done to perfection and the prawn entree was expertly seasoned. If you are looking for a unique Steakhouse dining experience in Toronto then reserve at BlueBlood.,4
Service was top notch - wasn't expecting it to that degree. Food is very expensive and the value isn't there. Drinks are awesome. Ambiance is exceptional. Great place for dates and special occasions.,3
"I called in and spoke with the GM, Adi, and explained to him that I would like to get a nice table for a special event with my wife. Adi went out of his way to find me a table and even called me prior to confirm. I know they have staff to do this, but it illustrated the extra attention to detail which carried on throughout my experience at BlueBlood.

Upon arrival, it was raining and we were promptly greeted by the host with an umbrella to walk us in. Within minutes we had a beautiful seat, met our server Mike and began ordering. 

Mike took the time to properly walk us through drinks, and suggested pairing options, while the bread and water was being delivered. We ordered a variety of dishes and they were all exceptional. The mushrooms (foregged just days before) were out of this world and complimented my ribeye like you wouldn't believe. 

I can't count the amount of servers and wait staff, but I have to say they didn't skip a beat. Very impressive.

Desert was the profiteroles along with specialty coffee. Fantastic.

Finally, the salted caramel chocolate was a nice touch before signing out. Well worth every penny, great ambiance, service and attention to detail. Can't wait to dine there again!

Thank you to Adi, Mike and the wonderful staff for making this a lasting memory.",4
"The dining room is beautiful and the service is top-notch, however I was hoping for more from the steak.  

We each ordered a starter and shared a steak as we usually do, since 16 oz is far too much for one person.  We requested that the steak be cooked 2 different ways (med rare and blue rare), as they accommodate us like this at other steak restaurants (i.e. Morton's), however we were told that it could only be done one way.  Fine.  We asked for it rare, however it came out medium well.  I would expect a high-end steak place to get the temperature right the first time.

The server and manager both offered to prepare a new steak, but we already had the sides and didn't feel like waiting for a new meal to be prepared, so we just kept the overdone one.  They took our 2 sides off the bill for the aggravation.  While I appreciated the gesture, I thought that perhaps they could have offered more (perhaps picked up the dessert).

Even with the 2 sides removed from the bill ($30 combined), the total bill still came to $200+ including 2 cocktails, 2 starters, one steak, one glass of wine and one shared dessert.

The service was terrific and the setting is romantic and decorated beautifully, however I am reluctant to return.  For the same money, I have had spectacular meals at Jacob & Co. and particularly at Harbour 60, where everything was cooked properly the first time.  Overall, I would rate the dinner as a 3.5, being 5 for the setting and service and 2.5 for the steak.  Unfortunately, since it is a steakhouse, the food should outweigh the atmosphere.",2
Enjoyed a beautiful dinner in the city's castle.  Service was excellent.  Drinks were good and strong.  I especially recommend the crepes for dessert.  Will definitely go back.,4
Food was great experience was great being in Casa Loma added to the experience only complaint was the obnoxious investment banker trying to get a deal in the table beside us definitely worth the money though great for special occasion,4
Great experience for a special occasion. Everyone was very friendly and was attentive. Enjoyed the rib steak a lot. Thank you,4
The location is amazing and the service and food excellent.  Start in the bar before moving to your table.  The menu is diverse but the wine list is very expensive for the quality.,4
"It's one of the good place for steak in Toronto.  Since you are inside Casa Loma, no doubt with the environment.
Service is pretty good, but there are flying bugs around the whole meal, which is pretty annoying.
Tried their Foie gras as appetizer, very nice.  But the bread it come with is just so so.
We have the Canadian Filet and Dry Aged Striploin, both nice.
As for dessert, we tried the Earl Grey Creme Brulee which is tasty and very smooth and creamy.
But for the Artisan Sweet Trio, it's ok, especially the macarons, it's not up to our expectation.",3
"We were extremely pleased with the service and the quality of the food. 
The servers and mangers were extremely welcoming and pleasant.",4
"Love the establishment / decor/ furnishings / location inside casa loma. A place I take to wine and dine guests from out of town or for a special date :). Seafood tower, caviar and steak, how can you go wrong with this menu.
Plus the Mr. Brainwash paintings!!! :)",4
"Overpriced and they went wrong with the meat. I ordered a rear fillet and I got a medium to well done one. This is not acceptable given the price level. On the other hand, atmosphere and service were perfect.",2
The waiter was quite rude and condescending. My date and I couldn‚Äôt help but to laugh at how idiotic he must of thought we were.,1
"The place was very pretty and the service was fantastic.  Unfortunately the food was really disappointing.  The salad was a bit soggy, the tuna tartare was lacking in flavor and the steak although cooked a perfect medium-rare, was not very flavorful.  It certainly did not stand up to Jacob or Barberians.  Given the price, I expected more.",1
Excellent dining experience.  Beautiful setting. Great for special celebrations or a romantic evening.,4
It was fabulous. Staff went above and beyond.,4
We had a wonderful experience at Blue Blood Steakhouse. The food was excellent & the service was amazing!! The venue itself was incredible. Having dinner at a castle is always a special feeling!!,4
"What an amazing place!  Everything you could possibly want to enjoy a memorable meal. Ambiance, spectalular food, delicious cocktails, extensive wine list.  Outstanding service. Will definitely be back. I would rate thid restaurant one of top 10 in Canada.",4
Had a great time. Visiting from Atlanta with 3 other girlfriends and throughly enjoyed our evening.,4
Fabulous for any special occasion.  Terrific service and delicious fine dining food.,4
"We wanted to pick a spot that meant a lot to the family (we all toured Casa Loma on field trips growing up) as we celebrated the closing of our parents‚Äô home of 60 years.  The fare, service, vibe, and atmosphere were all fantastic!  Thank you!",4
"Good Place to have Anniversary or any special occasion. Beautiful interior design, tasty food and good service. We paid around $300 which is pretty good price for special occasion. Steak was really but but wasn‚Äôt big fan of the spinach. All in all definitely recommended:)",3
"amazing restaurant, amazing staff, amazing food, a little pricey but worth it!",3
"Overall , blue blood was great! The food exceeded my expectations ! I had the French onion soup & Cornish hen and both were amazing. My partner had a rib eye steak and also said it was very good. The only downfall to the night was the service. It took an extremely long time to get our dishes and communicating with the server was difficult.",3
"I was very happy with the way the service was. It was my girlfriend's birthday and everyone really made it special, to have people we don't know wish her with a genuine smile was very impressive.  The food could have been better, a little overboard with the prices but I think you really pay for the overall experience and it was a great experience.",3
Wife‚Äôs birthday,4
Outstanding steaks in a totally unique venue. High level of service.,4
"Simply amazing. 
The dining was a true experience.   
Every course was perfection.",4
"We have never been to 5 star restaurant that had flies flying around and sitting on our food. We had fruit flies landing in our wine glasses and had to have new bottle opened.
Very poor hygiene and cannot even imagine how many flies in the kitchen.
We would have left but it was my birthday and did not want to make a scene.",1
"We thuroughly enjoyed our experience with Blue Blood. Right from the beginning...the ease of booking a reservation, the kind and professional service, the fantastic dining experience, and the care given to us while celebrating our anniversary.
The food was prepared perfectly to our taste, and was by far the best we have had in a while! 
Thank you for a wonderful evening, we will definitely be back.",4
Disappointing food - especially at those price levels and the special arragements I requested never appeared in spite of several reminders to them to be sure they would do so.,1
"Loved it!  Everything was terrific, service was amazing.  Thank you!",4
"We attended for what I thought was an anniversary dinner but ended up as our engagement! The staff went over and above to assist in planning and played a huge role in our special day.  First time eating at the restaurant but will definitely be back.  Great ambiance, food was stellar (portion sizes are great for sharing) and sommelier recommended a great pino.  Thanks for an amazing experience!",4
"Love the atmosphere, food very good, excellent for any occasions",4
Loved the seafood. The waiter was very attentive. Will definitely come back.,3
Excellent. A bit over priced however the price you pay for dining in a castle.,3
Very wonderful experience. Will return.,4
"Loved every second of our experience. The only two minuses were the fact that there was no stroller/wheelchair access to the restaurant, and the fact that we got looks from staff for walking out of the restaurant into the mansion to go to the bathroom and back (as if we would go on an excursion without paying).",4
"Power outage during dinner, was handled very poorly.",0
We enjoyed our meals very much and the service was excellent! Our waitress was very friendly & helpful and guided us with our selections. We will certainly recommend Blue Blood Steakhouse to our friends.,4
"BlueBlood Steakhouse is a stunningly decorated dining establishment located in Casa Loma. The food was well prepared, albeit with a high price point, and the service was exceptional.",3
Food was great but service was mediocre for the price you're paying.,2
"One of the best Toronto Steak Restaurants.   Put this restaurant on your bucket list. I enjoy the dining room to the bar but both a great.  The food is an experience that you will enjoy.

I be going back",4
Our drinks were great and the food was delicious our service was just very slow. But we will definitely be going back to try the seafood and dessert!,3
Second time there for dinner in 1 month. Great server. Great dinner. Parking should be complimentary and covered by restaurant. Otherwise no complaints.,4
"Amazing place with amazing food and services !!!
I really recomend  !!!",4
"Had the porterhouse and was very surprised that we were served such a low quality cut. Our cut had very few edible bites because the cut had a lot of connective tissue, perhaps cartilage, which made almost every bite extremely chewy and very unpleasant. Our porterhouse was served sliced by the chef, so the chef should have noticed all of the connective tissue and realized that the steak would not be edible. 

We had the porterhouse, cooked the same way, at Keens in New York City earlier in the week, and was expecting something similar. 

The porterhouse at Keens was amazing. The porterhouse at BlueBloods was terrible. 

However service and ambiance at BlueBloods was very good. If we go back, it will not be for steak.",0
"Brian was our server and he was amazing all night! My boyfriend and I went for my birthday and Brian was so attentive and helpful, it felt like we had a personal server all night! My boyfriend's steak was amazing and the smoked scallops were to die for. Definitely going to be back!",4
Way too much $$$$,1
"Server had a bit of an attitude. Did not go above and beyond. 

Bench side of the table was very uncomfortable, but the swivle chairs were nice. 

Appetizers were okay, steak was fantastic, sides were okay, dessert was really not good.",1
"Celebrated my sons 20th B Day after doing an escape room . The resturant is just stunning.  Pricey but very special place.  If u are a onion soup connoisseur like me, I would not recommend this one, for the price it wasn‚Äôt anything special.  All the sides are EXTRA My son had the $14 twice baked potatoe it was terrible. 
The steaks, drinks, Caesar salad, oysters we had were all fantastic. Service is impeccable",3
"Great service, great food, awesome atmosphere! The sea bass and Ontario Ribeye were amazing.",4
From beginning to end our experience was exceptional. Michael our server was awesome and very knowledgeable. Our entrees were to die for. We will definitely be back again.,4
"Blue Blood Steakhouse was truly a lovely experience. The food was divine. The service was impeccable. The overall experience made my last day visiting Toronto truly memorable. 

Every piece of food that hit my palette, made my tongue and heart really happy. Everything was flavorful and seasoned to perfection. 

Thank you for a lovely experience. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",4
"From beginning to end the service and experience was exceptional. I couldn't be more appreciative of the team there for creating such a wonderful evening for my clients and I. Thank you to Adi, and the team at BlueBlood for a lasting impression.

Highly recommend!!",4
"Great atmosphere!  Very good service and food, although a bit salty.",3
Outstanding service!  Delicious food!  Highly recommend and we will definitely be back the next time we are in Toronto!,4
More hype than substance for the prices charged. The restaurant trades off of being in a castle at the cost of over-the-top food.,0
We had a great evening! Our only thing to mention would be that our dessert came 5 mins before our hot beverages. I would have preferred it came at the same time.,4
"The steak we ordered was luke warm on arrival although done to medium in center not grilled properly on outside. I suspect grill not hot enough and steak had sat  for awhile plated in kitchen before being  served. Caesar salad awful...tooooo much mustard! 
Overall very mediocre dinning experience for the price. Should have been WOWED  but wasn't. In all fairness to our server she picked up on the salad issue and compt us a desert. Don't think I will go back until I see and hear consistant reviews of EXCELLENT! I would say they have a few things to improve on!",1
"Amazing location, in Castle, Casa Loma with well-manicured lawns.
The steak was cooked to perfection: the Castle dried striploin was excellent and well seasoned. The sides of salad, beefsteak tomatoes, fries, onions were appetizing to the eye.
The wine list is on a tablet with tasting notes and ratings, an ingenious idea.
Excellent service from our waiter, Michael.
Try to get a table in the billiard room on the left near the window.",4
Awesome.  Thanks A. Rod for the recommendation!  Highly recommended,4
Perfect in all ways.,4
"It was a surprise birthday dinner for my husband.  We were seated immediately by the window.  What a gorgeous restaurant.  Lovely booths, waiter was also great.  They have an amazing menu and was well worth our drive.  I would definitely go back.  The wine selection is also great.  We all started with the appetizers and then we all had steak.  Many steaks to choose from.  You will not be disappointed.",4
"Friendly staff, excellent food. We enjoyed everything about this restaurant.",4
"Unreal 
Amazing
Yummy",4
"We have eaten all over the GTA....I would rate it as our best overall dining experience .  Starting with the valet service, we were  wowed by the ambience of the castle and decor/comfort of the  dining room ......we were  treated to a superb meal, complimented by  great service and a very professional staff. The table side prepared caesar salad is a must and choice of steaks  and non steak options made it easy for our group of 6 to share 6 different dishes. ...all cooked to perfection.  We highly recommend Blue Blood and  Casa Loma for any occasion.  Keep up the good work !
Don",4
"This was our first time here and we will definitely be back!  The ambience, quality of food and impeccable service provided by Lindsey made it a fun and memorable evening.  We were also impressed with the knowledge of the sommelier who made a fantastic recommendation for our wine.  Overall, a wonderful experience and have already recommended to several of our friends and family!",4
"Great service, good food. Well worth the cost. Beautiful interior",4
Terrible experience. Could not get me a booth with 3 months notice. Food and service was terrible and way too much attitude. Stay away. They need to bring in a real restaurant manager.,0
Great cocktails and food! Service was very good! Our waiter was very knowledgeable. Perfect location for a special occasion.,3
Excellent service and quality of steaks and sides.,4
"It's very good, also brought out some handmade chocolates for a girls birthday despite us not ordering desert. Wine decanters are wonderful and they have a great selection of cuts of steak from the States and Canada.",4
"The worst part is the overpriced wine list. A bottle priced at $40-$50 is charged at $160-$200. Your breads were outstanding. The Cesar salad and appetizers were very good. The steaks were very good. The polenta squares and the sauce in particular, were excellent. The service was not fluid. The waiter was pouring sparkling water excessively and without asking whether requested and how much. Thus the waiter was emptying bottle after bottle, just topping the the glasses which were left behind full. The same happened with the wine. We had to order a second bottle as some people had full glasses they did not ask for and the one wanting a bit more had no wine left in the bottle. With the second bottle we had to ask them to clear the glasses (left behind) as the wine was different. The vegetarian section could be expanded a bit although you are a steakhouse but...

The ambience although excellent, a Toronto landmark, surprised us a bit. Pairing the Queen with Prince? At Casa Loma? A bit too far away. How about Diana? Megan? Little George?

In general, it is a good idea and we need a similar spot in the neighbourhood. Your main competitor is Scaramouche whose service is one of the best in the city and the food is very good to excellent. Your have the ambience though! 

Wish you best of luck and see you soon!",3
"Great ambiance, smart professional server, great steaks. Loved the table side preparations.
Was a little put off when told in the confirmation phone call two days prior that we would have to leave by 10 as they ‚Äòneeded the table‚Äô.
As it was a celebratory dinner booked weeks in advance I did not like the time restriction - especially as it was not indicated at the time of booking. We did not order an extra bottle of wine and went elsewhere afterwards.
Other than the restriction we thoroughly enjoyed the evening.",3
Made Father's day extra special. Excellent staff and delicious food.,4
Amazing service with gorgeous dishes. We really enjoyed our dinner.,4
"The purses & handbags need a storage basket . Because my wife hand bag got someone kick away from her chair.  We suggest have a storage basket under the chair, so it is convenient to have reach personal items.",4
"Tonight was a disappointment. We noted on our reservation that we were celebrating one week as husband and wife, and the server only acknowledged it after we mentioned it. To be honest, we were expecting a glass of bubbly or dessert or something that made us feel special, and there was absolutely nothing. We were so much looking forward to tonight, but it was a huge let down.",2
"The food was exquisite and the staff were friendly, attentive, and worked together as a team which was very nice to see. We were visiting from Boston and while we've been to many steakhouses, this one was definitely at the top of our list. We will definitely be back!",4
It was beyond amazing! The tomahawk steak was Phenomenal and the dessert was fun and delightful! Will go again,4
Very good but over-priced,4
I was absolutely wowed by the meal sevice and ambience. Lucky us to have such a real jewel in Toronto. I had heard previously mixed reviews and ignored them...so glad I did! Totally 5 STAR. Can't wait to go again!,4
Amazing!!!,4
"I took my boyfriend for his birthday dinner, this is the second time we have gone to this resturant. The first experience was amazing, and so I decided to take him again here and I am very disappointed with the service and food. We ordered two 10 oz steaks and the waitress only brought us one to share between the two of us, by the time the second steak come out it was about 15 minutes later and we both lost our appetite. The food took forever to get to our table from appetizers to dessert. I will not be going back.",1
"The venue is simply incredible and the vibe of the restaurant is quite impressive. Service was exceptional, wish I remembered our servers name - she was amazing. The food was tasty, wouldn‚Äôt say it was perfect. The steak was good but the sea bass stood out to me the most, very flavourful. I found the sides a bit boring (especially the beefsteak tomatoes) and salads quite tasteless. On the other hand, dessert was yummy :) had a great time. Would recommend the place",3
"A beautiful meal with amazing attention to detail and fabulous service. Pricey, but for a special occasion we will definitely be back. A+++",4
I find it quite odd that we had to pay $30 for 4 prawns and we only ended up having 3 served to us? Also....why was the waiter so pushy????,4
"The atmosphere was lovely, very beautiful. Food incredibly tasty, though incredibly expensive too. We had to wait an hour for our table even though we made a reservation, not ideal. Had the Wagyu steak, unbelievably good.",3
"Just wanted to go out for a nice dinner with the mrs. The service and staff were mediocre, the food left something to be desired. 
One of the crab cakes was ice cold in the middle, the duck fat fries were far too thick and very much undercooked. The crispy kale was extremely salty. The steak was nice, nothing special. Harbour 60, or Morton‚Äôs will definitely cook you a better steak. 
The service was extremely slow. The front of house staff seemed on point but the kitchen was lacking. Almost 4 hours total. Waited far to long for drinks and when the food did arrive, it felt as though it had been tossed out of the kitchen in a hurry. 

The restaurant is beautiful and that‚Äôs clearly what you‚Äôre paying for because it is definitely not the food. 

I do have to admit the baked Alaska was exceptional! It was the only redeeming quality of the entire night.  
If you‚Äôre person who truly enjoys fine dining and not just a trendy spot it‚Äôs this isn‚Äôt for you.",1
"Fist off the reviews for this place are spot on.  There are better steak houses out in the city.  The dining room is fantastic.  Food overall was all over the map.
We had the table side caesar salad which was good.  Not the best I've had but very good.   Now for the steaks.  They were truly unremarkable. My wife's steak ordered medium rare came out a true medium  +.  They acknowledged that.  My ribeye was not seared and while cooked to proper temperature just was pretty bland overall.  The 4 sides our table ordered were quite small and nothing stood out among them.   The desserts we all enjoyed.  The baked Alaska and the Profiteroles.  The drinks as most reviews mention are toally overpriced compared to similar establishiments.   Dining room was very nuce albeit a little dark for my liking.   The service was excellent and they adjusted the bill accordingly accordingly and to our satisfaction without any fuss whatsoever so full marks there.    So while the staff tried to make us happy with our visit I left with a feeling of not wanting to go back so fast if ever.",1
This is a phenomenal restaurant with friendly wait staff. This was a very good place to spend quality time with someone special.,4
"Overall experience great as usual, love the ambiance",4
An all around amazing experience! Worth every penny. Can‚Äôt wait to come back again!,4
"We had a wonderful time celebrating a special friend‚Äôs birthday. Food was delicious and atmosphere was beautiful. Our waiter Jordan was very good and personable. We also met Carlo, manager and he also was very personable and made our evening fun. 

Overall, the experience was amazing !!  We would recommend Blueblood to all our family and friends. 
Cheers to fine dining",4
"On a business trip to Toronto, I arrived prepared not to be impressed,  as I grill Alberta Beef regularly and have never been shy to say I rarely get a steak out as good as mine. Service was friendly and attentive on arrival. I started with the scallop ceviche, presentation was artistic and delicate.  Many layers of flavours, and textures, so good, too good to share. Next several of us had Caesar salad prepared table side, something you don‚Äôt see much of anymore, but when it is done right-  it is the only way to go.  The preparation was not intrusive, but he was there to ‚Äúcreate our salad‚Äù. Cold, fresh and crisp, great garlicky dressing, pancetta and freshly micro grated cheese, wonderful.  In anticipation of the steaks arrival, we ordered a Brunello,  wonderful nose, a distinct Tuscan terrior, and a silky finish. I had ordered medium rare Australian grass-fed strip loin, it came sliced on a cast iron charger. It was perfectly seared on the outside, and exactly medium rare. The steak knives were completely unnecessary, as it more tender than any filet I have ever had, literally melt in your mouth.  Unarguably the best steak I have ever had, the Charley Daniels lyric immediately came to mind  ‚ÄúBecause he knew that he‚Äôd been beat‚Äù. Despite having been dethroned as the self-proclaimed king of steaks it was delicious to the last bite. Not being a desert guy, i still agreed to partake in table side Crepe Suzette, -how could I risk not doing so.  As the desert cart rolled up, and positioned so we could all see what was about to happen, we could immediately sense the passion  that was going to go into our desert.  While the pan heated we were introduced to the full spectrum of ingredients and toppings that were going to go into making our desert a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù.  If all deserts were like this, I might become a desert guy. Subtly sweet, and with toppings alone and in combinations, every bite was different, paired with an espresso, the perfect end to a perfect dining experience.",4
"Outstanding service, beautiful ambiance, and great steaks!! It just happened to be the first night of the symphony in the garden as well, very romantic if your looking for dinner plus tour Castle Loma and enjoy the sweet sounds of the symphony.",4
"Fantastic service and will be back for dessert and tea again. attention to detail in stunning surroundings/ 
Will definitely be ""TemptingTravellers to"" enjoy BlueBlood @fknightevents",4
Fantastic restaurant in an old castle.  Food and service were great. It is Expensive but worth it.,4
Absolutely awful service and food!,0
"We‚Äôve dined here multiple times, the food and service are the standard that all other fine dining restaurants are measured up to. The  entire dinner experience at BlueBlood is defiantly worth the price tag at the end of the evening. We always look forward to our next visit.",4
Absolutely AMAZING from start to finish. A MUST Toronto experience for a foodie or anyone who truly appreciates the fine dining culture.,4
Food and Service was great. Only down side was as sun set it shined thru windows and half our table was blinded by light for 20 mins since there are no shades on window.,4
Overpriced! Need to offer lower priced wines. A 5oz glass was $22.,2
"This was a fabulous experience.  From the cocktails at the bar to the tableside caesar salad thru the bsked alaska,  this was worth every penny! Food was exceptional, service was excellent - attentive, friendly and appropriately respectful.  It was my husbands 65th birthday and it really felt like a super special occasion! Thank you.",4
Beautiful ambiance and very good food,4
"This was a beautiful location, with the ambiance done brilliant.  The service, our server Sergio was attentive, full of information and guidance of our choices. It was beautiful to have some of the dishes provided and made at our table, a added enjoyment.  My partner describes his rib eye steak as the best he has ever had, he has eaten a lot of steak.  I had the Cornish hen done perfect.  I recommend the Baked Alaska for dessert, also done at table side which was a joy to watch.  Highly recommend but do know that with such excellence is a high price on the bill.",4
"The service and food was fantastic. However I dont understand there 200% mark up on the wine.
I certainly understand the value of great wine and they do have a fantastic wine list. While most top steak houses mark up wine by 75 to 125 percent.
The wine prices at blue bloods left me with a  feeling of being way over charged for my evening. Due to the wine prices we will not be returning to this restaurant.",3
"Wonderful place for Anniversary,  Weddings, dinner for two. Knowledgeable staff, great food.",4
"For a high end restaurant, service was extremely poor. Upon arrival we were left waiting at the door coz the hostess was flustered. For an establishment like this, they need to get an experienced hostess. Our server was MIA and we had to call over for service constantly. 

Only the bar tender was absolutely amazing and made the night. He was on point with drinks, gave us a history lesson on Casa Loma and because our server  was Missing In Action, the bartender was coming up to us to serve our drinks.

This place needs a major change in management as staff was very poorly managed. 

We ordered table side salad and dessert but due to the way the tables were set up they could not do the table side and did it at the back of the restaurant and then served it to us. Don‚Äôt offer table side if that can‚Äôt be provided. Duh!! 

For a steakhouse they failed at making the steak to perfection. 

If you are a foodie and love your steak that comes with fabulous service and great ambiance don‚Äôt waste your time at Blue Blood.........go to Hy‚Äôs instead, you will not be disappointed!",1
Great experience Courtious management and staff Beautiful ambiance We really enjoyed it  and will definitely be back,4
We were in the dining room. Like a ghost town most of the night. Yet we were only allowed to book at 5 or 5:15.,2
Amazing place with amazing food! Our server was amazing and took good care of us (her name was Sheila).  Great atmosphere so calm and relaxing.  It is pricey but the portions are very generous and I would definitely recommend it for a special occasions !,4
The best steak in Toronto,4
"Wonderful service and great food. Service was well-timed, friendly and helpful. We ate in one of the three rooms, the Lounge,  which was quite noisy probably due to a lot of glass. Watching some of the tableside food preparation (Cesar salad, baked Alaskan)  was entertaining.  although the castle is closed, a few rooms are visible on the way to the washrooms. Everything is √Ä la cart and expensive so look ahead at the menu to see if you can afford it all.  For three courses and drinks, easily $200+ per person. Memorable.",4
"It was my birthday..we wanted to feel the castle environment but got very disappointed...first at the entry they took my balloons, apparently they can‚Äôt go to the dinning room..they said: ‚Äúwe will bring it with the cake‚Äù and they didn‚Äôt, they forgot! Second our food came cold, we ordered the porter house and mushrooms and spinach as side dish  all of them cold..the only thing warm there were the plates!!! Then, I asked for a glass of wine... the server proposed another one, she said that they had a bootle open that‚Äôs usually never happened before and bla bla.. so I asked if the price was same and she said YES which was a lie the wine she sold me was about 7$ more expensive!! In general, the table is very small nothing fits, the sofa chair very low and uncomfortable, no music in the background and absolute no great service for that money...we payed over 500$ and expected to have the perfect night. We don‚Äôt recommend this place.",2
Food was good but also underwhelming. Service was lacking - did not feel special being there. So many different staff serve you and although our waiter was great the other staff did not seem happy to be there. Ordered a dessert that gets set on fire and it was made across the room by another table which was quite disappointing. Probably won't go again but was nice to try once.,2
"This was a great beautiful place...My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and it is definitely something to give someone a wow feeling on a special day...the service is top notch.   The best thing is that sometimes in restaurants food can be good and service is lacking, or service is great but food is mediocre.

Here everything was hitting in a great spot making it an overall wonderful dining experience.

The only bad thing is all the food was so good I had no room for dessert cant wait for a table side dessert next time",4
"First time going to this restaurant.
Celebrating Mother‚Äôs Day.
Fantastic experience! Great food and service.",4
Excellent service and food ...consistently!!,4
Mothers day,3
"Unbelievable ambiance and vibe, hard to beat eating a steak in a castle! The food was very good, however the steak definitely undercooked. Personally I don‚Äôt mind, however a $100 cut of meat should be perfect every time with no exceptions. Service was excellent!",3
"Beautiful room.  Although I reserved for our 25th anniversary,  no special acknowledgement was made; no special table; we were greeted at the door but no one offered to check my coat so it was draped over n y chair the entire meal.  Lots of very, very loud, obnoxious (expense accounts?) diners.  Service and food were good but not enough to warrant the $400 tab for Caesar salad and a shared steak.  Glad I went to check it out but we both agreed we would not go back.",2
"Soooo lovely! Beautiful rooms, very good all around and felt like a very special evening. Rack of Lamb was great, Caesar salad was fun and delicious.",4
Food expensive and not exceptional.,2
It was good as always.  I‚Äôve been there a few times.  But this time we were celebrating birthdays.  Two of us. You would think that the restaurant could have comped us a 14$ cheesecake but they didn‚Äôt on a bill that was 450+ for two of us.  Maybe it‚Äôs not their policy but still.,2
"Food and drinks were terrific. Service was great! Only criticism I can offer is to diversify your appetizer menu. Otherwise, stellar.",3
"At the prices they charge I really did expect better service. My waitress disappeared after bringing the bill. I must‚Äôve sat there for 20 minutes looking for her. For me this was supposed to be a great dining experience, especially at over $200 a head. Really wouldn‚Äôt return due to shoddy service. It‚Äôs my second visit and the first time wasn‚Äôt much better. I understand that the expectation of service is much greater outside of canada. Most locals probably wouldn‚Äôt mind but I‚Äôve experienced 5 star service so I know what to expect. Too bad. 
Also my preferred bottle of wine was sold out. I was forced to get a wine I didn‚Äôt really want. It was one price point higher. Perhaps they could‚Äôve matched the price ($30 difference) seeing as they were out of my first choice. 
Not sure I would go back.",3
Amazing location and outstanding service!!Good for special occasion .But its pricey(((,4
"Everything was fine. Was it great? No. Was it bad? No. It was just fine. The steak was fine, not great. The service was good but not quick. There was a LONG time between appetizers and mains coming out (we were told it‚Äôs because the porterhouse takes a while to cook (to medium rare? That takes 30+ minutes?). 

I honestly just don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs prices are justified. I‚Äôd much rather go to Morton‚Äôs. That being said, the rooms are beautiful and the staff was very friendly. 

A lot of managers around just talking to each other considering we were the only table of 20 on the one side of the dining area.",2
"Great atmosphere, disappointing that we had to pay for $10 parking- it should be included as casa loma is not open at that time! Food was good, the baked Alaska tableside demo was amazing.",3
"Our dining experience was terrible. A guest joining us had to send his steak back 3X because it was not cooked to the temperature he wanted. The lack of service in the beginning stage of our meal was awful. They sent out extra sides as a way to make up for it but that didn‚Äôt help the case. Our friend did not even eat his steak after he third time it came
Back out as everyone else was done their meal and it still wasn‚Äôt cooked. The kitchen staff is ultimately to blame, however; for an upscale restaurant- they should make sure all the staff is prepared to meet those standards. Especially the kitchen. Our server was fantastic and felt horrible for what us happened.",0
"An experience with amazing food! Since it is located inside Casa Loma, of course, it is just as fancy as the castle. Definitely a location for a special occasion or if you happen to be dressed up. The food is prepared beautifully and the cocktails did not disappoint. Example: My fiance ordered a smoked whiskey drink that was brought to the table in a glass dome full of smoke (see the attached pictures). The only downside to this location, if you are there before sunset, the sun beats in and does heat up the rooms quite a bit. Still an amazing, fancy dinner spot!",4
Great restaurant but pricey. Food was very good quality and excellent service.,4
"Amazing ambiance, food and service.",4
"From the moment I walked into this castle, I was treated like a king. I was greeted warmly by everyone I made contact with. The staff was attentive and memorable. The decor and ambience were unique and delightful. I have never experienced a dining experience like this before and I will never forget it.",4
Amazing experience,4
"Great ambience, especially around the sunset. The natural lighting is great. The rooms adjacent to the dining area are great for pictures.",3
"Wonderful venue, setting and food! But definitely for very special occasions given the price! A $200 steak gives you an idea :-) but the quality was definitely there! And the service was great!",4
"Wonderful food, ambiance and attentive, friendly staff!",4
"I thought it was a little pricey...beautiful location, great service

Also need to do something about the sunlight, we were at the worst table that had bright sun shinning in for most of our diner, beautiful after the sun went down.",3
Everything is great but the steaks. The place is super cool inside. Cocktail list is interesting and wine list is great but is as marked up as anything I‚Äôve seen.  Be prepared for a really big tab. The real issue though is their steaks should be better.  If they were awesome i wouldn‚Äôt mind the rest of the costs. We tried multiple kinds and compared to the other steaks houses in Toronto at the top of the scale they just aren‚Äôt as good. Leave it for tourists.,2
We dined at BlueBlood Steakhouse for my fianc√©‚Äôs birthday and we had an incredible experience. One of the best steaks we have ever had. Beautiful place with an amazing ambiance. Would definitely go back!,4
Best customer service I have ever experienced!,4
Best food ambiance ever...Definitely will go again highly recommend 10 stars :-) exceptional service loved it!!!,4
It should never happen but my steak came Luke warm.  Not acceptable at that level and price.,4
I am so pleased by the whole experience. To rate 110% on my scale. Especially how attentive the whole crew of Blueblood Restaurant. Food and Service are immaculately fabulous.‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§,4
"Incredible experience! From the moment we pulled in the gate, to the moment we drove away, everything was extraordinary! Valet service was very nice, and since it was raining, a gentleman escorted us with an umbrella from our car to the door. The check in was easy, and the staff super friendly. Great experience at coat check, as well.  The food was spectacular and service the same! Nowhere else in the city compares to this!!",4
"Very good steak was amazing 
A bit expensive
Very good night",4
"For a picky eater like me, eating at BB was a pleasant experience. The food was nop notch and server was knowledgeable. Will return again :)",3
A very special occasion that was not really fully appreciated by management . The food and staff was amazing!,3
"Amazing food at, the wagyu is a must try.
The French onion soup is also outstanding.",4
"Very nice restaurant in mid-town Toronto.  Typical of many steakhouses these days, the portions are large.  Skip the appetizers.  They feature Baked Alaska for dessert, which one does not find very often.  Again - large portion, split the dessert.  Excellent setting and service.",4
Fantastic dinner! Our waiter was amazing with great attention to detail. The maitre d was very attentive and came by several times. Meal delicious.,4
"Basically was good over all but I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan as other places around the gta are better in ways , what I didn‚Äôt like was paying for parking when I am already spending a small fortune on dinner . Lobster size is very small , the Caesar salad isn‚Äôt the best I‚Äôve had way better . The place is beautiful inside and the staff is great maybe more time will
Help it‚Äôs only been open a couple of months .",2
Pretty overpriced for an ok steak. Ordered a more pricy 16 ounce ribeye and came out looking like 10 oz too which they said the bone makes up a large part of the weight. Didn‚Äôt expect that sleight of hand! Our friend ordered sauce on side and it was on her meat dish. For the price you pay we expected perfection and overall was pretty far from that. Ambience and locale was top notch and good wine selection.,2
"My wife and I always enjoy fine dine in the city of Toronto and this was no exception. So she decided along with my son and his GF to treat me to a Blue Bloods Casa Loma dining experience for my Birthday. Super ambiance and service and great place for dining with the most attentive staff.  Excellent choice of steaks from the finest meat producing countries, however I must admit somewhat ridiculously overpriced, both on the Turf and on the Wine selections. Bottle of very fine Decoy 2013 California Carbenet Sauvignon for $260, which you buy at the LCBO for $64.26, ambiance and service certainly does not condone slapping on a price tag which is over 4 times the regular retail price. Be prepared to dip deeeeeepppp into your pocket as a fairly nice meal for 4 could set u back approx $1200. Observing Quintin create the Baked Alaska table-side was pretty cool and worth the show. Absolutely delicious desert! I would admit that notwithstanding the bill, I absolutely enjoyed the company the meal and the experience!!",3
"Average food at an above-average price point. Not recommended.

Went with a group of guys for a quarterly night out: bill for five of us was just over $1k, including one bottle of wine. Not cheap.

Considering the price point we were all really underwhelmed. The quality just wasn‚Äôt there. The ambience is great, it‚Äôs a wonderful setting, but the drinks were average, service was a bit contrived (he recommended the most expensive cocktail, most expensive apps, most expensive mains and desserts - it was kind of laughable) and the food was no better than what you would get at the Keg, let alone places at comparable prices (Jacobs, Harbour 60, Michaels, etc). 

I don‚Äôt want to say I would never go back, but I don‚Äôt think I would pay to go again.",2
Excellent experience from start to finish.,4
it was good,4
"Service is top notch at this steak house in Casa Loma... everyone feels like they are VIP. Seafood tower is good value all things considered.  Of course the resto is expensive but that is to be expected. I was most impressed with the truffle oil for the bread and the insanely good cocktails.  Also, our server was so attentive without being intrusive.  Highly recommend.  Dined on a Saturday night for my bf's birthday and also I loved the bar. And hostess really took care of us with a beautiful table. Thank you!",3
"The service was great. The atmosphere seemed entertaining in the dining room and the area with the oyster bar.  Unfortunately, we were seated in a small room just off the kitchen with only 6 tables which is not a great place to sit.   Unfortunately,  we also found our meals to be lackluster so overall it wasn't a great experience.",2
"Excellent service, the wait staff went above and beyond expectation to rectify a small miscommunication. Beautiful and lavish ambiance, we wanted to stay all evening!",4
"Besides the restaurant being impeccably clean and beautiful. We requested a high chair and a spot to place a car seat with a baby inside, and when we arrived they had everything set up perfectly and comfortably for us. We definitely appreciate all the little things they prepared for our visit. It was a rainy day, and valet service with someone to walk us inside with umbrellas was a excellent touch. Coat check was also available. Service was outstanding. Waiters were charming and helpful. Definitely recommend for special occasions because it‚Äôs on the pricier side. Plates were a bit small for the value but everything was delicious. My favourite was the wagu steaks from different countries (American, Australian, and Japanese) with 3 different salt options for flavouring.",4
"food wasnt good, over priced, and .................hhh",1
Fantastic ambience but a tad expensive.,4
"The service, the food , the atmosphere and experience was amazing. Our server (Sergio) was super nice and making sure we had all we need.  The food and dessert was delicious. The atmosphere was made the night even special. Will definitely return. I have to say the night was perfect and best birthday experience ever",4
All good. Service 5* Food 4*,4
Disappointed in seeing level of dress code. Expected better for ‚Äúfine dining ‚Äú.,2
"We loved the aspect of sharing our entrees thus enabling us to try many different items without eating to excess. Also the staff was very welcoming, attentive, punctual and made our dining experience a dream come true. PS It was our 35th anniversary of meeting each other. Truely a wonderful experience.",4
They really make you feel like you‚Äôre dining at a castle. Loved the experience and the food. Thank you everyone.,4
No complaints.  Wedge salad needs a little more dressing imo,4
"Not sure where all the 5 star reviews are coming from... maybe these reviewers don't know steak...
First, the good - beautiful dining room, you can tell no expense was spared, truly appropriate decor for a steakhouse. Every square inch of wall was covered in intricate woodwork. A carpenter's wet dream. 
That's where it ends. The service was mediocre at best, and the food was an utter disappointment. 
Scallop ceviche to start - utterly flavorless, the chef forgot that a ceviche needs an acid. No citrus, no salt. The 'mango' was tasteless and had the same texture as the scallop. Sad. 
Next up - 'seafood tower' - if the proprietor would like to see what a real seafood platter looks like, please visit La Castille or Zorros. Might not be as pretty, but they know how to do things right. Half a lobster tail @ less than 2 oz for 2 people, with nothing to dress the crab or lobster in other than cocktail sauce? A single crab leg? If I was there with another man and not my wife the night would have ended then and there in a fight. 
We save the best for last - the steak. Ordered the wagyu tasting @$250 for 12oz. I love a good wagyu steak. The three cuts all came out at the same time but at various levels of 'doneness' - one overcooked, one undercooked, one just right. Although all were extremely tender, they weren't properly salted and the marbling wasn't right. I've ordered Japanese wagyu at least 5 times in the past year at various restaurants, this was by far the worst. I've had better steak at the Keg...
For you fine diners out there, the total bill for two of us was within $40 of what we spent at Alo for a proper 10 course meal with 9 wine pairings for 2 and service that made you feel like an absolute king. Please please please - spend your money elsewhere for a real dining experience and let the Liberty Group find someone else to pay the $3m in financing on the beautiful millwork and marble slabs in that stunning dining room.",0
Nice ambiance.  Attending to celebrate our anniversary.,1
"My partner and I celebrated our birthdays together. We love steak and typically go to Jacobs.  The food at Blue Blood was delicious, the service was excellent, the wine list was tasteful. We ordered French onion soup to start which was very rich. For our main we ordered 2 ribeye steaks that where perfectly marbled and good. They could have used a little more flavor our steak sauce offerings. Then our sides where the lobster Mac and cheese, truffles pur√©e and asparagus; all delicious. We ended the night with a hazelnut profiterole which we both ordered. We would definitely go back for a date night or with friends.",4
Service was phenomenal. Staff was extremely personable. Food was exceptional. Atmosphere was really amusing. Certainly worth a visit even if a bit pricey.,4
"Amazing best restaurant in Toronto by miles , food is so tasteful you want to have the whole menu , we visted from London and checked this place out twice. Hit it up",4
"One of the  most beautiful dining venues in Toronto, the service and ambiance is second to none in the city. The food is good quality but menu is somewhat boring and not up to the standards of the rest of the establishment. The portions are decent in size but the staple menu items are just good, not outstanding. The drinks are also presented very well although we didn't have great experiences with the tastes of them, much too strong for a lot of our table. Overall an experience everyone needs to have once, but it wouldn't be on my go to list for repeat nights out. You are really coming to dine in a castle, the rest gets lost within a sea of exceptional restaurants within Toronto.",3
Birthday dinner with family,4
Had a great time food was great service was amazing the only thing that wasn‚Äôt good was when we arrived we sat down and two tables after us were seated and received bread to there table first,4
"The ambience is serene, but has a fun vibe.  The art work on the walls is phenomenal.  It feels like you are dining in an art gallery.  The food was tasty and prepared well.  Our waiter was exceptional on all levels- very experienced and didn‚Äôt miss anything.",3
We thoroughly enjoyed our experience! The food was amazing and the service was excellent. My only complaint was the 5 oz wine option. I really wanted something more like a 8or 9oz to enjoy however my options were 5 or half a bottle which I didn't want. Other than that it is an exceptional atmosphere with generous portions. We will be back for another special occasion!,4
"Loved the experience!  The atmosphere is spectacular and draws an eclectic crowd.  The French onion soup was the best ever, kale salad is incredible, desserts are off the charts.  Even though the fish fillet was bland and the meat was tasty but on the chewy side, we would definitely go back and would definitely recommend to others.  Valet service was awesome and the staff are very pleasant.",4
Ambience was fantastic and service was the best I've had. In one of the rooms the sun sets exactly in-line with some of the seats facing the window so it can be blinding. Once the sun set however we were able to see the restaurant for its true aesthetic.,3
The service was amazing. So many waiters bringing out the different courses of the meal. The room was just like an old castle setting.,3
A truly glorious meal in one of the most beautiful locations in the city!,4
"Great service from the host, we were seated right away. 
Our server was very attentive, we didn‚Äôt have to wait for anything. Our server was pretty formal, we tried to get him to relax a little bit because we are laid back people.  By the end of our meal he managed to relax and enjoy the people he was serving.  

The sommeliers were on point also.  

We started with some cocktails and ordered a bottle  of wine with our meal.

We shared the seafood tower for 2, a nice 10oz cut of the wagyu beef and ordered some sides and dessert with a candle. 

We were celebrating my partners birthday on his actual birthday.  For the amount of money we spent for 2 people, our bill was in excess of $500, I would have expected the dessert to be complimentary.  However it was not.  This was the only downside to our special evening.

Ambiance was great , food was prepared perfectly, service was good also.  

I would return on special occasions only.",3
"We had an awesome night, food was amazing and a fantastic variety.  The service was good not great as they should have brought dessert for my mom's birthday as Harbor 60 would have done. The wine is WAY OVERPRICED,  sommelier should choose other more appropriate wines or lower their prices.  We know a fare bit in regards to wines and the ones listed were overpriced, more so than  Harbor sixty.   We were the only table with a full house to have a bottle at our table, everyone else's table had a cocktail or just a glass of wine, that should saw something.",4
"My boyfriend and I went to BlueBlood to celebrate my birthday. It was overall a great experience. we ordered a Seafood plate for two, Tuna tartare and lamb stack. The lamb stack was amazing, although  a little pricy. The service was exceptionally good. They even gave me a birthday card for the special day. Thx! We really enjoyed it!",3
It was a good experience thank you,4
"Waiters and servers were a bit u professional. Had to wait 49 minutes for reservation time. 

Food was ok. But not worth the money. It was kinda like dining at Niagara Falls. Not an upscale dining experience",2
"Service was very good indeed as the wait staff took extra good care of us.  My food was OK, but the girlfriends was outstanding.  

Depends on what you order, I guess, but overall the food is good.

Only problem is the price....$600 with tip and tax, makes this the most expensive restaurant in Toronto, so be prepared!",2
"This restaurant blew me away! I was so thrilled with the level of service and incredible food. They take such care in making sure that all the food is perfectly made. I will definitely come back here to try more of their menu. Yes it is pricey, but you are getting a top notch experience.",4
We celebrated a ‚Äúmilestone‚Äù birthday at BlueBlood - no better setting for this! The service right from being greeted & seated to meal completion was excellent. The server was attentive but we never felt rushed. The meal was fabulous! We started with a French onion soup - broth rich & flavorful and the tuna tartare - yummy! My husband had the salmon which was cooked perfectly. I had a wagyu filet which was tender & tasty. My only criticism here was that I had asked for it to be cooked medium rare to medium and it was actually rare. I expect better from a place where this is their specialty and the price! We finished up our meal with coffee which was excellent - freshly made and perfect temperature - real sign that a restaurant places importance on quality! (Sometimes it‚Äôs the little things that make the experience). Overall this was a wonderful birthday celebration and we would definitely come back!,4
Service and ambience fab. Steak just ok . Expected wow for the price but it fell short.  The bar is beautiful though and serves fab,3
"Service was great professional and not rushed, we were left alone to enjoy each other's company which is lovely because my very  close friend is special to me and I don't see him enough ( thank God)  drinks and wine were excellent seafood townhouse was fantastic and ribeye from Erin was very tasty all be it slightly closer to medium than medium rare but thats how my best friend likes it anyway s üòÅ will be back it's a neighbor Hood spot",3
"What to say ?
Over promises . U der delivers",1
"Have dined in most of the city‚Äôs steak houses, this is by far the worst one in food quality. Atmosphere is good if you like the cliche of dinning in something historical. Food is over priced for what it is. I will most definitely not visit again unless major changes have been made. 

If you want a proper steak, Jacob‚Äôs or Harbour Sixty or Barbarians will be better choices.",2
"It took a really long time for our order to arrive 
When it did all the steaks were wrong 
We ordered 5 orders of  ribeye and see got Striploin instead
We were too hungry to wait for new ones despite the extreme apologies
Bill was over 1k",1
"Exceptional! I love the attention to all the detail. Food, ambiance, and attentive service. Very cool vibe. Will be back!",4
"Fuimos a celebrar el cumplea√±os de mi
Novia el trato inigualable y la comida extraordinaria",4
"We make a reservation at 9:45 but we came early for 30 mins. They did not have any seat available for us to dine in early. So they brought us to the waiting lounge. Is @ the second floor of the restaurant. Is pretty nice and comfy (the sofa), but is really cold in the lounge. It seems like there's no heat here. 

In the meanwhile of the wait, I ordered a non-alcohol drink. They don't have any menu for non-alcohol drink but they will ask you what kind of drink you would like. I told them is hard for me to pick without a menu. So I told them I like something that is fruity and sweet (well...they asked me). Basically they surprise you, they don't tell you what kind of drink is it. Just drink it; it's pretty good tho. 

So we got a seat around 10:00 and we already know what we wants to order. (We saw the menu while we was waiting for the seat.) The food came very fast. And everything was prefect. But they did not give us bread. I was waiting for it!! The waitress said she will bring it, but end up she didn't. 

The best food of the day will be the Earl Grey Creme Br√ªl√©e. This one have a very strong taste of earl grey. Which it's good because a lot of place don't have that strong taste. I'm a big fans of dessert.

We did not order any drinks/coffee along with the dessert, but the table beside us ordered a coffee. And it's smell so good. 

After you pay the bill, they will offer you a salted caramel truffle (complimentary). It was so gooooooodddd!!!! I love it so much.",3
"We found the food and service mediocre at best.  The ambiance ,however, was outstanding!",2
"Outstanding food, service and ambience. This has to be one of the most extraordinary restaurants in Toronto. What else can be said about dining in a castle?",4
"Great atmosphere, amazing service and good food. Too noisy though.",3
"drinks and ambience are both amazing. Unfortunately, food and service did not live up to that high standard.",3
"Had a great evening. My friend and I spent the entire evening catching up so I didn't really look around. I'll have to go back just to see the decor!
Our server anticipated our needs without interrupting our conversation and the timing of the dishes was spot on. The food came exactly as ordered for both of us, my steak a perfect medium rare. Not all steak houses seem to be able to time things properly.
I'll certainly come back again. Loved the experience.

One small quibble was the noisiness in the dining room. Lots of hard surfaces bounce the sound of conversations around.",4
A superb evening! Everything was 5-Star including the attentive service by the manager who gave me a tour of the original art work throughout the restaurant.,4
"Came to celebrate my birthday - and celebrate we did !
Nothing short of perfect. Amazing meal, impeccable service and a stunning table. Thank you BlueBlood",4
One of the best meals we have ever had..expensive but worth it.,4
Divine all around,4
"Our waiter Mark was a stand up guy and was very thorough with us as it was our first visit, this helped make the experience a good one from the beginning. The atmosphere is lovely although the lighting was perhaps a bit too dim even though I get what sort of ambiance you are looking to create other steakhouses like Jacobs do just fine with much brighter. It helps alter the experience of the food and if you're paying $100+ for a steak it is nice to see the cut, texture and quality of the cooked meat on the plate. All in all this visit was a late Valentine's dinner and I can say that we both enjoyed the venue, food, drinks and overall experience.",3
"We enjoyed the wine, the food and the atmosphere a lot. The only complaint I might have is that, the restaurant was really very noisy. Me and my husband literally had to shout out to talk /listen to each other. I know it‚Äôs a very old building and the history of it makes everything even more special but maybe some soundproofing might help. Other than this, it was a very special night. Our waitress that night was also very knowledgeable about the menu and gave us an outstanding service. Thank you all!!",3
"This was our first time to Blue Blood! What a fantastic experience. The setting, ambiance, charm and over the top professional service of the staff was 10/10. The ""mini condo' of seafood( for 2)vs. the Tower of Seafood (for 4) started our dining experience with a very enjoyable Valpolicella. Followed by creations from brilliant staff in the kitchen to delivery of our entrees made for a fantastic setting . A huge thanks to everyone from the parking lot valet services to the ladies at the desk as we left!!!!
We will definitely be back!",4
The setup of the restaurant itself gives it an air of supreme elegance. The oak room is more sophisticated then the billiards :) excellent food. We did the turf and surf (rib eye and saint crab legs) cold the get any better.,4
"I would ask for their definitions of how you want your steak done as there are a wide variety of steaks. I felt my medium bone-in rib eye was too rare. 

Being able to eat in this great landmark deserves the premium pricing, although I did not think the food quality stood out as being better than other high end Toronto steakhouses. 

If you do go here definitely dress well. All males patrons were in suits.",2
Me and the hubby haven't gone out on a date for the longest time since we had kids. A friend of his recommended this place and we decided to check it out and were very impressed with everything from the food to the service to the atmosphere. Would definitely recommend this place to to others and we will definitely be back again.,4
Bluebloods was amazing!  My husband and I dined here for Valentine‚Äôs Day!  They are overly expensive and if the prices were a bit less would be even more outstanding!,3
"We had a lovely dinner with an extremely knowledgeable server.
Take time to have a walk a guided walk through of the main floor of the castle.",3
The service was incredible and the food was terrific as well.  Beautiful decor in what I think is the main dining room.  It was expensive but they made the experience worth it.,4
"The ambiance is impossible to beat. The service was on point. The food was delicious and the serving size was surprisingly large...unexpected. Yes, it is a little on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for. Perfect for the right occasion.",4
"The food was great! Great cut of meat perfectly cooked to medium and delicious sides. A sea bass dish was not good, the iron cast dish smelled like metal which ruined the taste. The service was horrible everyone was rushed to feed you more for example the sommelier poured the wine in the decanter before allowing us to taste it not to mentioned that he was super serious and rushed! The sever was the highlight of the bad experience, he refilled our wine glasses before we had even a sip. He rushed us to order the food and he was suggestion based on assumption that we do not know different cuts of meat to the extent that when I ordered my steak he actually said ‚Äúare you sure, this cut is pretty rich and tasted meaty which is not good the Wague is better‚Äù which was double in price .... if the dish is not good why have it on the menu?! We had a couple of judgmental comments which I did not appreciate. The pinnacle of he‚Äôs bad service was when he lit the Alaska dessert dish and had to turn it off with a plate while knocking out a few other dishes in the process !!? Plus, I had to keep asking for drinks a couple of times and couple other things that overall created a terrible experience specially for  $200 per person.",1
Fabulous experience. Recommend for special occasion.,4
Ambience at Casa Loma was great and the service is outstanding.  Good steaks and overall very tasty food.  Obviously a little on the pricey side but I knew that going in.  It was a great birthday dinner for my wife.,3
"Very nice food, very well trained, well mannered service staff.  The whole staff worked as a team from the moment we parked.  No coat check ticket required, all orders were accurate, nothing cleared until we were both finished - attentive, but only when you need something, top marks there.  Drop a fork? Before you realize it's on the floor a new one is at the table.  Need more water?  (Trick question - the wait staff will not let it get empty.)  VERY good wait staff. 

Pre-meal bread/butter/oil was nicely done.   Simple,but lovely flavors.  
The steaks were beautiful.  Cooked perfectly as requested, a selection of salts to season yourself was a nice touch.  Peppercorn sauce was very bland, but that's my only negative for the food if I had to find one.  The price is also over the top, (minimum CAD100 / person with no alcohol) but it was very very good.  Paying for this meal did not leave a bad feeling with me.  It was very very well done.  The sides are also excellent.  All sorts of very well options, and very large portions.
Make sure you are hungry.  Did not have any appetizers - probably a good thing, as the two of us could barely finish the meal.

Restaurant itself was beautiful, everything was very clean, proper and well laid out.  A few pretentious patrons taking selfies were sort of annoying, but that's not the restaurant's fault.  

Overall - extremely satisfying evening.",4
"Car was in valet , nice ambience had a table for 2 ,  was celebrating a birthday, figured a 300$ bill would at least send out  a desert with some candles like they did for the table next to us. Was a good first time experience",2
"Right from our first step through the door, the customer service wasbeyond exceptional. The ambience, food, wine exceeded expectations. A magical experience indeed!",4
"Excellent dining experience. A tad pricey but overall well worth it. Ambience and decor is gorgeous. The food was very good. 
We are definitely returning.",4
"Very good restaurant,,,amesing service with good quality food....little bit overprice for the kind of food. Very elegant place and romantic at the same time.The location is also good with planty of parking.It is a must try.",3
Exceptional service ambiance and cuisine. Looking forward to my next dining experience there.,4
Everything was good and I think you should try their Wagyu steak for sure.,3
"Ridiculously expense and fawning,  over the top,  service. Service -   too much -  if you like traditional invisible formal service -  this is not the place.   The french fries were good but there were 5 or 6 of them and they cost $14 plus HST and tip. Cocktails $20 plus. Ceasar salad promoted as outstanding & preparation was enjoyable , but it was a mediocre caesar salad. No vegetables served with any entrees. Everything a la carte.   Small  selection of reasonably priced wines ie under $100 a bottle . Do I really need an ipad instead of a wine list?  So dark I couldnt read menu. Steak was pre cut sliced  and as a result the meat went cold quickly. Olive oil for bread had truffle oil in it.   If you like truffle oil great... me not so much.",0
Spectacular!  Attentive service. Food and wine well worth the price. Be sure to visit the bar and let Troy prepare your drinks. Dinner and a show. Enjoyed a beautiful evening.,4
"Extremely good steak, perfect but double baked potato was not the best. Wine we find excellent Barolo at right price",4
Great meal and service,4
"Beautiful restaurant, over rated and priced steak.",2
"Loved it! Great ambiance, amazing food and beautiful sexy decor. Service was top notch. Definitely will be back.",4
"I was not impressed that we had to pay for parking!
The owners of the restaurant should eat the charge for the parking... too tacky",2
"Great night out, service was perfect.  Food was superb and wine selection was phenomenal.  I would highly recommend BlueBlood steakhouse for a special occasion, business dinner or date night.  The dining rooms are perfectly appointed and very comfortable.",4
Exceptional experience on every level. Great addition to the Toronto dining scene,4
One of the best meal I have had in years.  Much needed addition to the Toronto dining scene. Nothing like it,4
"I had the pleasure of dining in a Castle. This truly is an awesome experience and one that can‚Äôt be compared with any other steakhouse in Toronto. From the beautiful decor and art throughout the restaurant the food was amazing. 
Steaks done to perfection. Impeccable service.  
We shared the porterhouse Medium Rare. Caesar salad made table side was delicious.  Followed by Wonderful Baked Alaska Desert. 
Definitely a place to spend  a special night. Birthday. Anniversary or that promotion. 
Must try!

Dom S.",4
"When you step into BlueBlood, the staff is inviting and very professional. The restaurant itself is stunning inside, with elegant yet rustic decor. The food was excellent, I would say the best steak in the city. However, the valet service was very slow. Took way too long to get our car. However, I will definitely be dining again!! Thank you BlueBlood for an excellent night out!!",4
"Beautiful venue, but the pricey food just misses the mark.",2
"From the moment we walked in, we could smell the delicious aroma of truffle oil and bread! Delicious salad, followed by a huge portion of juicy chicken and tasty steak. Strangely enough, we preferred the chicken more than the steak. On top of everything, we experienced excellent service by our waitor! Definitely a luxurious dining experience saved for a special occasion!",4
Superb! Absolutely delicious steaks - great accoutrements and friendly but professional service all carried out in a truly beautiful room!,4
Great evening.  food was fantastic. Service wonderful.,4
"Great atmosphere and decoration. The service was fantastic, and the food was excellent.",4
Family get together.....wonderful ambience..will make it an annual event...great food and lots of fun,3
It was an amazing dinner. The atmosphere was perfect for our dinner. Casa Loma offered old world charm and grace. The service was excellent and the food was fantastic. The dry-aged tomahawk steak was tender and full of flavour. Thank you for an excellent evening Blueblood Steakhouse.,4
Excellent overall experience. A must if you haven't been!,4
Had a great night.,4
"No matter how much I love the location and wanted to like Blueblood, but unfortunately I was disappointed. It was my birthday celebration dinner on Saturday night at early reservation around 6pm, the only available time when I booked 2 weeks beforehand which is fine, I understand this is a popular restaurant. The parking was a bit confusing in dark so I used valet parking. Valet service was prompt and courteous. Price self parking $10, valet $15 kind of no choice. We arrived, greeted friendly and we don‚Äôt need to wait long then we we‚Äôre leaded to the dining room. I‚Äôm so disappointed  that they put us in side dining room not the main room, the little room right by the door and face to kitchen... not gonna lie, I hate it so much. We weren‚Äôt offered a tour like the other reviews, I guess they just canceled this during weekend?  Now comes to drink and food.  My fianc√© and I both ordered ‚ÄúOnce upon a time‚Äù cocktail, it‚Äôs very delicious. Smoking effect just like the one we tried at BarChef, on a little smaller size. The breads and herbs butter cream was a highlight, amazingly good. We ordered a dozen of oysters, table side Ceases Salads for two, 2 orders of USDA prime ribs and we were stuffed. Steaks were cooked to perfection, tasty. Salad was creamy meet the height standard. I don‚Äôt have bad things say about the food but somehow it missed the attentive attentions that we are not feeling to be treated special. In the meanwhile, I miss Tom Jones and Zorro‚Äôs so much. Sad to say, it‚Äôs a stunning restaurant in a stunning location with a modern touch, but I miss the piano music, the warm welcoming servers that treat you like their family members, the quality meats without attitude.... I won‚Äôt come back, it‚Äôs not the price tag. It‚Äôs me feeling something is missing, some places without a heart.",2
"We had a very good experince, very nice waiter, but the food is way to expensive compare to the quality!",3
"Took my clients out for dinner and was unbelievable impressed by the ambiance and staff. A manager came over and asked if it was our first time dinging at blueblood, which it was, he made us feel very welcomed and offered wonderful recommendation. Definitely go for the Wagyu tasting, nothing I've experienced in the city compares.",4
"My husband and I visited BlueBlood steakhouse for a romantic date night and right away we're greeted by a group of lovely ladies who made us feel warm and welcome. Our server Hailey was phenomenal, kind and extremely attentive. We started with cocktails, I believe mine was called once upon a time and I was taken back by how delicious it was. My husband and I shared the table side caesar salad to start, it was delicious and the theatrical  element really stood out. The steaks came out with three salts that complimented our medium-rare rib-eye accompanied by mouth watering sides (we had the truffle mash, cream corn and broccolini). After experiencing the table side caesar my husband and I could not resist the baked alaska that was also done tableside!!!! My husband considers himself a wine connoisseur, and wow we're we ever impressed with the wine list.  I will definitely return and hope to become a castle regular.",4
"Absolutely spot on in every regard. Special thanks to the sommelier and our more than excellent server, Sheila. A true gem that made us feel welcome, warm and well looked after.",4
Food was awful. Cold and over cooked. Way to over priced for lack of quality,0
Great menu. Food was delicious and service was outstanding. Great attention to detail. We celebrated a birthday,4
Very slow. Steak was chewy and the service wasn't all that great. Took them 15-20 minutes each time to bring two cocktails. Disappointing overall.,0
"Very underwhelmed by the food. Average steaks, bland seafood and gnocchi served encased in cold cheese. I would not return for this reason alone but also realize that this restaurant is extremely overpriced. Dinner and drinks for two was just under $600. At that price a dinner needs to very good, something Blue Blood does not come close to achieving.",2
"We went to BlueBlood for my husbands 56th birthday and were joined by another couple that we invited. Everyone has an amazing evening. The castle setting let‚Äôs you know you are in for a special evening before you even get inside. The staff were all excellent and the place had a real cool vibe. Although we had to wait 45 min past our reservation time, we were given complimentary champagne and enjoyed our time while we waited. The food and service were wonderful and we wil definitely be returning. Amazing place!!",4
"We had a reservation for 9 but did not get a table till 9:30. We ordered food at 11pm due to slow service. 

The steaks came out cold for the wagyu taster.",3
"Arrived at 8:30 for our reservation, didn‚Äôt get seated until 9. No apology was given. When the restaurant called to confirm reservation, they asked if it was a special occasions..told them it was and gave them the details..they asked how to spell our names but nothing was ever done at dinner. Not the kind of service I would expect from a restaurant like this for $200+ a head.",1
"Great new Steakhouse in Toronto, inside a castle (CASA LOMA). The food was outstanding. Amazing cocktails. The service was perfect - thanks to our sever Raz - who was extremely knowledgeable, efficient and professional. He asked and probed about our preferences and then provided us with recommendations - which made for an excellent outcome and overall experience. Thank you Raz. We will definitely be back. 
Peter  Porfiris",4
"I‚Äôd give this place a 10/10! 
Dinner was excellent. Staff was amazing, attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. They made you feel welcomed as soon as you walked in. The view was breathtaking. Best place for a date, or any special occasion. 
I recommend getting dessert for sure.",4
"The staff was exceptional from the minute we exited the car to time we sat at our table. Just lovely, helpful people. Food was fantastic.",4
best serviceÔºÅ,4
"Excellent food although not fine dining style. Location, ambience and surroundings are lovely and lend itself to a fine dining experience but it is not haute cuisine style.   This is classed a steakhouse but the steaks are truely expensive.  Yes some steaks were 40oz but even the smallest cheapest steak runs at $65.  Not sure too many people had a steak while we were there.  Other dishes are reasonably priced.  Staff perhaps too many for the number of guests but it was a quiet night and only one half of the restaurant in use.  This I guess is reflected in the price.   Bar area is nice and cocktails very good, again a little pricey but you are dining in a castle.  Portions are good and perhaps the starters are too big?   Overall a lovely place to dine and be pampered but be prepared to pay the price.",3
"It was an anniversary dinner for me and my boyfriend. Really nice atmosphere, perfect place for the occasion. Service was really good. Waiter was well educated with the food and drinks on the menu, great suggestions on both. Food was quite decent, no matter the doneness on the meat and seafood, and the taste. But I would recommend to give the dishes a little twists in terms of flavoring to make it a little more special or add more choices on the menu. Overall it was a great experience and I wouldn't mind going again IF they add some new dishes.",3
"The experience was enjoyable because of the ambiance but ,there was a few mishaps with the food. We found plastic in the tuna tare tare and the the steak was overcooked. They accommodated the vegan in the group.",2
Great for a special occasion for a date or for a celebration.,4
Outstanding service.  Steaks were cooked to perfection.   Overall a fantastic experiemce. Will definitely return.  Highly recommend.,4
"The restaurant is very nice and table service staff were excellent. The door staff and the hostesses were busy chatting amongst themselves to bother with customers but the most disappointing thing was the quality of the meat and shrimp, for both cooking and presentation of 3 out of 4 entrees. 
Cooking staff neeeds improvement.",2
I was disappointed with the experience at BlueBlood. First all All it seemed inappropriate to have to pay 10 for parking giving the cost of the meal. There was gum stuck under the table where we were seated and a waiter dropped Ketchup and it stained my dress and handbag. I had higher expectations for this restaurant,1
"Wonderfulrestaurant. Beautiful ambience, with incredible cuisine! Food is quite pricey, but the experience is worth it. Recommend going during December so that you can hear the live orchestra while you dine!",4
This was our first time visiting Blue Blood. We had an excellent meal and the service was great. Highly recommend this restaurant.,4
"Too expensive!! Great place and service but, not worth the money!! Probably the most expensive restaurant in TO.",2
"Great dining experience on New Year‚Äôs Eve.
(And our first time visit in Casa Loma!)

The waiter at our table was very friendly and he gave us excellent services! Thank you so much.

I would definitely go back for another special occasion :)",4
"The  steak tasting option was good , the service was excellent and  nice ambiance",4
Definitely a special place for a special occasion but not if you are on a budget - it‚Äôs expensive.,3
"There was nothing I could say bad about this restaurant. They went above and beyond in the service department to ensure my engagement went off without a hitch. They were accomidating on dietary restrictions on one of the appitizers and the Steaks cut like butter. They were seasoned perfectly with the right amount of salt and did not require more. They do bring you different salts to the table that did not need to be used. The Deserts were also amazing.

The sides were very good as well although I did find the spinach a bit salty for my tase and the side mushroom sauce a little bland. Stick to the red wine jus as it was very good.

People will say that this place is expensive and it is. But you are eating in a CASTLE. The atmosphere you won't find anything quite like it in the city. And unlike many places that go for that trendy or heavy on the atmosphere the food matches what you would expect. Even the service was 100% spot on. Friendly and attentive to the smallest details.

I will recommend to anyone looking for something special in their steakhouse.",4
"Was for a birthday, the restaurant provided a card, was a nice touch",3
"Absolutely THE best steakhouse in Toronto.  The service is top notch.  Decor is almost overwhelming.  We had the Wagu tasting.  Large portions of each.  The menu is extensive and has all the usual steakhouse classics (Caesar salad prepared tableside, etc.) plus a good selection of sides to round out the menu.  (We didn't make it to the seafood selections but the table next to us were enjoying the crab immensely.  Will return for that.)  The cocktails (especially the smoked applewood one - can't remember the name) are s selection of perfectly made classics along with a few really interesting new ones.  Recommend for a business dinner or a romantic evening.",4
"Outstanding restaurant!  My new favourite in Toronto.... setting is beautiful, excellent meal and first class service.  Not inexpensive so be prepared to pay for an exceptional night out.",4
"Love the place, very classy dining feel. Came here twice in one week for two seperate occasions. Definitely will return again.",4
"Definitely exceeded my expectations. Their steak and steak burger were both very good. The steaks are quite expensive so I would reserve going here for a special occasion unless you have money to burn. The meal cost was roughly $200 for 2 with 2 glasses of wine, 2 mains, and 1 side (as the steaks do not come with a side). 

The only infuriating downside that almost had us cancel our reservation is they ran out of parking onsite. There is virtually no alternative parking nearby. We had to park all the way down the hill by George Brown College and walk 15 minutes back up the hill in the snow.",3
"BlueBlood steakhouse is more than a unique location. Its excellent service, delicious food and an one of a kind experience. We were celebrating our 3 year anniversary here and I could not be more delighted. I was called ahead of time to ensure I was still attending and the service from when we arrived was bar none the best I have ever had. The restaurant upon entering was exquisite. From marble to hand carved walls & ceilings- I could tell why Blueblood had the beaming reputation it had. We dined in the Windsor room and most of the time we couldn't help but look around at all the details surrounding us. We were greeted with a hand written letter at our table that was celebrating us on our anniversary. It seemed like everyone knew why we were there; made us feel special. Valet parking is a must by the way (small difference in price comparative to parking it yourself- totally worth it especially in cold conditions or on a weekend when its difficult to find parking at the castle). Our waiter, Chris was professional, humorous and knowledgeable at anything that we asked. He walked us through the menu & gave us his personal favourites following our concerns. He had a great personality and seemed genuine in making sure our first experience was special.  The food.. DELICIOUS. My steak was cooked to medium rare perfection while the seafood options for my significant other was plentiful. Much to our surprise there was a symphony playing that evening in Casa Loma and following our dinner we were able to be seated at the front via private seating for Blueblood steakhouse guests which was impeccable planning and resourceful of the Liberty team. We then took a stroll through the castle to help digest the delicious food we had consumed.   All in all this restaurant really blew me away and I most definitely will be looking for plans and/or excuses to be visiting again! Romanticized by its surroundings and shining because of their service+food - BlueBlood Steakhouse is a must visit.",4
"The location is one of a kind. I wouldn't say the steak is top 3 in Toronto (compared to a Jacobs &Co). Also, we found the service to be a bit over the top as in they at our table every 30seconds. Overall, id recommend this steakhouse for a special occasion but if your looking for exceptional steak I would look elsewhere.",3
"found the lighting to be a little to dark to read menu, chair could have been cozier, a larger mixed drink menu, food was great but a little expensive, a special occasion place only.",2
"We had a fantastic experience. The service was exemplary, up to and including getting a handwritten list of the staff's favourite single malts. The ambiance is... I mean, it's a freaking castle. Definitely a special occasion place to keep on your short list.",4
"It was my first time at blue bloods, from the moment i walked in the hostess and the ma√Ætre de were both very nice.
The service was ok, the guy making the caesar salad was amazing, passionate and knowledgeable.  Drinks were so so, a couple of mistakes made
Steaks were ok, I would rather they season them themselves but overall It was an ok meal.",3
We celebrated our 25th Anniversary at Bluebloods. The service by the staff and the quality of the food was just tremendous.,4
Excellent service and food. Needs improvement for washroom facilities,3
Excellent food. Impeccable service but staff a bit stretched which resulted in longer than expected periods of waiting for service.,3
"Dinner in a castle - done and done. Amazing everything, will revisit.",4
We would like to thank all the staff for making our dinner fabulous. Our waiter was super helpful and the recommendations he made were great:),4
"Enjoyed a meal with my Husband for our anniversary.  The food was incredible -
steak that literally melts in your mouth.  The garlic mashed potatoes were a little slice  of heaven!  The only food item we were not crazy about was the jumbo prawns very bland & the seafood sauce waa not great.  Either than that we will be back.  A little pricey but I felt it was worth it for the gorgeous interior, atmosphere and the to die for filet mignon.",4
"I celebrated my 19th birthday at BlueBlood Steakhouse, and from the moment I arrived, I felt so special and welcomed. I honestly felt like a princess on my birthday, and all the staff (not just my waitress) went out of their way to make my experience the best possible. My waitress, Hayley, was outstanding, and all her recommendations were an absolute hit. She was so friendly and made the whole group have a truly magical experience. I recommend this restaurant to everyone who is looking for great food, atmosphere, and service. I will definitely be returning!! Thank you to everyone at BlueBlood Steakhouse.",4
"Loved everything about this place!

The food, service and ambiance was phenomenal. I would definitely go back!",4
"We went for my husbands 31st birthday, and everything was perfect. We were blown away at the food and the service. Zero complaints about this restaurant. I would go back, and have been recommending all of my friends to go here, it was an experience full of great conversation and food. It‚Äôs not cheap, but the portions are a great size. The French onion soup was the best I ever had, and their dry age tomahawk was to die for!",4
"The cocktails at the bar were a very nice start, and the ambience a superb mix of traditional with modern but classy. 
The service was good, in particular the sommelier spent a bit of time helping choose a wine with dinner. The waiter seemed perhaps to spread out and inattentive, and too cool to be hospitable.
The food could have been great, but the plates were barely warm and all the cooked sides as well as the mains were almost cold when served. 
Despite the good points, a dinner where one has higher expectations shouldn't fail on the primary reason why guest went there- for DINNER.",2
"What an amazing place for a fantastic night out,, how fitting to have a quality steakhouse in a Castle!  The atmosphere was relaxing yet elegant.  The food was phenomenal and the wait staff were all amazing.  

I would highly recommend BlueBlood Steakhouse to anyone looking for a quality night out.",4
It is rare that a restaurant lives up to all the hype. This one does!   Complements to Management who put together this team. ‚ÄòNuff said.,4
VERY average food.  Nothing to write home about.  Beautiful decoration and location.  Expensive for what you get.  Good service.,2
"Went with my friends and husband to celebrate my birthday. everything was great they even gave me happy birthday card. 

The profiteroles were amazing.",4
"We went for the first time Sunday for my husband's birthday.  For the price, more than $500 for 2 we were disappointed in the value. Filet mignon was a nice cut, tender but not much flavour.  Sides were pretty good (asparagus a bit woody), Cornish hen was delicious.  Caesar salad for 2 at $40 was fair--too much vinegar, not enough egg or parmesan so vinegary and lemony, too strong and heavy on the garlic--not a great balance of flavours--disappointing and was supposed to be table side... we could barely see the chef preparing it.  I had requested something for my husband's birthday re dessert but it never arrived.  Wine was good but very overpriced for quality.  Aaron, our waiter, was great--best part of the meal.  Attentive, helpful and professional.  Not sure we'll go again.  When we arrived at reception, several women, disorganized... best thing was the mini tour with Sammy.  She was great--that I recommend if you go for dinner.  And it was complimentary!",3
"Fine dining at its best.
This is the place made to impress.
Expensive, High End, Classy and fit for a Queen (as she looked down at us from the Art on the wall)
It's a castle...what more could you expect?
Cinderella never had it so good.
Highly recommend...",4
"First time dining here. Had the Caesar Salad, Wagyu Filet Tasting,  Duck Fat Fries and Profiterole. For the Caesar Salad table serving, the portions are big and would've preferred to share an order but it was min 2 people. Wagyu and fries were ok. Profiterole tasted great and nice presentation. Wine markup was high. I don't think it's worth the value. Service was great. Nice to try at least once but wouldn't consider it my favorite.",2
"Service was excellent. Food was very good.
Our special occasion was enhanced by our evening at Blue Blood.
Thank-you",4
"Had a 9pm reservation on a Thursday night for a group of three. Arrived at 8:55pm and weren't seated until 10:15pm. Nobody was the least bit helpful.... it was always ""you're table is nearly ready - it will just be a minute"". Heard that at lest four times. There were about 4-5 other groups is the same boat as us, so I can't imagine this was a one-off.

Once seated, food and atmosphere were both exceptional.

To their credit, a significant portion of our wine was comped and the manager was very apologetic once we were seated.

Still, an unacceptable thing to experience when you're paying >$300/head.",1
"Best dining experience ever!! From when you arrive to a beautiful castle, (yes an unbelievable castle in the heart of the city), to when you leave, everything is exceptional. The ambience, service and food were far beyond any dining experience in Toronto and maybe North America. Casa Loma and BlueBlood are extraordinary.",4
"Outstanding service, beautiful setting , great food---a lovely experience.",4
"A great evening.  Emily was wonderful, pleasant and professional.  Ambiance and decor and artwork impressive.  I would suggest a bit more light, hard to read the menu.  Also,my friend wanted to have black coffee but they only offered Americano.",4
"The American 10 oz wagyu came out very thin and small. I must say I was not impressed at all from first glance. 
However, it cut like butter and the meat was so well marbled it was delicious. It is so much better than the wagyu presented in the wagyu tasting. 

The scallop carpaccio was light with a tint of citrus and sweetness. Very yummy.

By far the best ceasar I have had! Our server Raz was very enthusiastic and gave impeccable service.",4
It was wonderful,4
It was ok. Just ok. Very overpriced for what you get. Don‚Äôt mind to spend that amount if the dining experience is incredible but food was average at best.,3
"Outstanding. Great food, great service ... definitely going back.",4
"Our first experience dining at BlueBlood. Ambiance was exceptional, as was our dinner and the personnel service was second to none. All the staff were extremely cordial and specially our server Peter.

Thanks for a great night out!

George C",4
Overpriced for the taste of the food. Not as good has harbour 60 or other local steakhouses. And good came out fast felt rushed good ambience and nice staff,2
"$1,000 for two people including a $250 bottle of wine. Insanely expensive",3
Outstanding food and service.  Highly recommend!,4
"Food was hands down amazing, had the Australian Wagyu... Words can not describe üëÖ

Atmosphere is different, cross between stylish contemporary and hipster dbag.  Service seems to be the sore spot, servers dropped a glass at the table next to us.  Then spilled a drink right into the lap of someone in our party.

At those prices, food is worth but service doesn't live up to the hype.  Perplexed about returning at this point.",2
"Great restaurants and food, but was wating for 30 minutes for a reservation , order two times a drink and after 30 minutes waitin at the lobby they let me in and brought the drinks at the same time. Not very well organized. It  is very pricey but it worth for one occassion.",3
Very expensive. Definitely for deep pockets. Service and ambiance outstanding. The waiter were very patient with our twenty something sons who had a lot of questions about ingredients and food preparation. Possibly the best service I have ever had. They encouraged my sons to check out the building between courses.,3
"Celebrated 2x birthdays - service and experience was amazing, steak dry aged was so so not sure I would try a dry aged from them again but lots of other stuff on the menu to enjoy!",4
"Very good food, excellent service, but way overpriced for what you get.",2
"It was my first time trying Canadian Ribeye and it was AH-MAZ-ZING! It's a beautiful castle that's been renovated (you won't be cold). They have an extensive drinks list, and a food menu that caters to every type of steak lover as well. The service was fantastic - and the servers were very knowledgable of the menu, exactly what you'd expect from an upmarket steakhouse. All in all, it's worth every penny - you won't regret a thing!",4
The restaurant was amazing!  The staff were very knowledgeable about the food. I had a allergy which I was concerned about and the server made sure that I would not have any problems. It is a very beautiful setting and it was a wonderful experience.,4
"Dined at Blueblood for a birthday celebration.  Absolutely beautiful space...both hip yet maintaining the grandeur of its Casa Loma setting.  Staff and service were top notch.  
Food was excellent.. Our steaks were done exactly as requested.  Wine list extensive albeit expensive.   Baked Alaska for two was over the top !!!!
Would definetly recommend Blueblood but be prepared to spend some money.   
It's an experience !",4
"After waiting for 45 min past out reservation time of 8:30, we were finally sat.....is this an attempt to pad the bar bill? Not like 8:30 is ‚Äúprime‚Äù dinner time.  Food was decent, sides were okay.....disappointed with the lobster mac n cheese....pasta was not macaroni but rigatoni and tasted bland (no seasoning)...disappointed with the blandness, not the pasta type, Duck Fat Hand-Cut Kennebec Fries were too large and as a result, the interior of the ‚Äúfry‚Äù was not fully cooked. 
The steak knives at the table were dull (all 3 of them).....nothing worse than trying to cut meat with a dull knife... 
ambiance was great, bench seats were too low for the table I think and not firm enough to make for comfortable seat for a meal.
Service (aside from the 45 min wait for our table) was fantastic.2",3
"Our reservation was for 8.15
We were only seated at our table at 8.50
That was not right!!!",0
The food was horrible. Waste of my money. I'm disappointed.,0
"The food, service and ambiance was very good but it was way overpriced. $1500 for four people. Some of the best restaurants in the city are $200 per person including cocktails and wine. This was almost double. We ordered some of the cheapest wines on the list and did not get carried away with expensive cuts of meat.",1
A perfect dining experience!!,4
Porterhouse wet aged was amazing.,4
"One of the worst dinner experiences we have had.    Overcrowded, late by 30 minutes to get table for 8:15 reservation made 3 weeks in advance, missing items on menu like no charcuterie board and ran out of Stella beer (they had 1 and search 20 minutes for another to say they ran out). Offered a corona and said it was on the house.  When I got bill they charged me for 2 Stella anyway. I had them correct it.  Food was horrible.  Expensive steak all had way too much salt and over cooked and charred.   Sweet potato fries soggy and saturated with salt.  I could go on but won‚Äôt suffice to say the waiter tried but The experience missed the mark and was more of a cheap pub experience.   Super crowded and noisy to an extreme.  And 10 parking with no valet?  Too many door staff not adding a lot of value.  Really poor and will never return",0
everything was amazing my only complaint would be about being seated. we had a 7:30 reservation which we were late for (called in advance to let them know) and we still waited about 10 minutes for our table to be ready...,4
Good place but not the best.. still beautiful building.,3
"For the price, steak was subpar. Steak wasn't cooked properly despite ordering it medium rare. Definitely not as good as some of the other steak houses in toronto, like Jacobs. If you are going to spend this amount of money, wouldn't go here.",2
"The service was outstanding, they catered to all our needs. The food was out of this world. Highly recommended.",4
"French onion soup had no Thyme. Fois Gras was the worst I have had, too much citrus in the Ahi Tuna Tartar, Steaks were all good, Lobster tail was well cooked, sides of fries, broccolinni, kale were seriously not worth it.
We eat out a lot, all around the world, if your going to command $300.00 per person....  food needs to improve.",2
"Food was amazing! 
The restaurant is beautiful. 
Service was also excellent.",4
I asked for my steak medium rare but it was over cooked to medium well. They handled the situation well and replaced it with a perfectly cooked steak medium rare.,3
"Excellent! A magical venue, fantastic service and excellent quality food!",4
"Overpriced food infused with popcorn?  
Never again, and never recommended.",0
Great service.  Very good food.  Excellent wine list.  Amazing ambiance!,4
I founded it a bit overpriced when you look at the general experience. Service was good but very disorganized. Wagyu was the real thing. Sides came almost cold. My meat was a bit more cooked than expected. Our waiter was really good and the young lady who was also helping him. I don't think I will go back again.,1
"Very over priced, average food, very noisey, pretty atmosphere. Far better steak places in the city.",1
Staff were amazing! Location was fantastic for a special night! Food was really good too!,4
Food was very good and the ambiance was very amazing. Our waiter was fantastic and the service from everyone was above par! Very good experience,4
Lovely food and service!!!! An enjoyable evening and such a special dinner,4
"Great atmosphere and beautiful space. I really was hopeful that the sommelier assistance would have been more insightful. Also for an expensive bone-in steak, I want it served the way I ordered it. It was served sliced and turned cold after I had explicitly asked the waiter for unsliced. I remarked but did not send it back as I didn't want the food to go into the bin. Just a few links to sort for this restaurant can be what it aspires to be.",3
Was seated 40 min late.  Other than that the place was great.  The service was excellent.,3
Service was outstanding. Beautiful restaurant and a great location - Casa Loma!,4
Best Steakhouse in Toronto. The ambience is the most spectacular in the Country from exterior to the interior details. The art is exquisite and the food and service compliment the fact that you are in a castle.,4
"Beautiful room. The food, not so much.  The steak was undercooked and frankly should never have ended up on the plate. Far too fatty. Would never have been served at other steakhouses in the city.",1
"We celebrated our anniversary at BlueBlood.  We liked the seating and ambiance right away.  There was a dedicated person who could explain the wines you were interested in.  That same person would fill up your glass as you were enjoying your meal.  Our server was so knowledgeable and great at his job.  The food was fantastic.  Our favourite sides were the gnocchi and mushrooms.  We did order the dessert in which it was prepared in front of us.  Overall, I would highly recommend this place to anyone.",4
"This place has a very nice setting,  for the food quality, the prices are a bit high, but that is to be expected with the high overhead cost. The food was great, presentation was on point, the servers although very friendly and attentive, lack subtle training of other high end restaurants. (Spilled multiple drinks and brought food while I was away from the table.)  But if some is that pompas as not to enjoy an evening because of little things, who needs them. Overall everything was good and I had a great evening.",3
"Wonderful! 
Birthday boy received the best seat in the house with a personalized birthday card.
Staff was polite and the food and drinks were outstanding.",4
"Naturally it was a beautiful atmosphere as it was within Casa Loma.  Parking was surprisingly cheap ($10) which is a stark contrast from the menu (as you can expect in finer dining restaurants).  Service is good, they have a variety of wait staff tending to your needs (our Caesar salad was made in front of us) and the ambiance of the restaurant is elegant.   The proportions of the appetizer we had (Scallops & Ceviche) were pretty disappointing, even by fine dining standards.  The steaks were pretty good as were the sides if not over-priced.  We certainly enjoyed our meal but for the quality it was just a bit too expensive.",2
Amazing ambiance and outstanding service. The cocktails were delicious and the food was very good. Old school classics served tableside added to the luxury of the evening. Would definitely recommend.,3
"Whatever your occasion, BlueBlood will remind you that you're special, and your tummy will also thank you for it.",4
"AMAZING, ONE OF THE BEST RESTAURANTS I HAVE BEEN TO.",4
Great atmosphere and decor. The bar is also fantastic!,4
We are foodies and loved this restaurant. It was perfect in every way.,4
"Excellent food though extremely expensive. If you're spending $300plus for dinner for two,  parking should be complimentary.",3
"Beyond expectations - this steakhouse takes service to the next level. Food incredible - Ambiance, come on its Casa Loma!",4
"Fantastic food, even better service. Raz, our server, went over and above to make my fianc√©'s birthday dinner memorable. Would definitely recommend it! Can't wait to go back!",4
Loved everything since the welcome at the door to the the chocolate served with the bill,4
"Beautiful dining experience. Service is great
 The good stood there. This place charges more than the average top notch steakhouse and the food is absolutely terrible. There wasn't one thing we ordered that was enjoyable. I'm not even sure I'd eat here if free. Our meal was $800 and I literally liked nothing .

I really wish the food was good because the setting was beautiful. I think it's not become a place to see and be seen type place and someone having good food escaped the objective list.",1
Fantastic experience!  Beautiful location with a nice ambiance. Food was delicious !,4
"BlueBlood....What a great restaurant. The food, staff and service was exceptional. Will be back soon. Worth every dollar!!!!!",4
No complaints. The steak was perfect. The tartare on point. The spectacle was exactly that on the ‚ÄúOnce upon a time‚Äù. Dazzling setting.,4
"An exceptional wine list, and the tomahawk streak certainly didn't disappoint! The crispy kale and garlic mash were exceptional also. Only complaint is that our reservation was for 9:45pm and we weren't seated at our table until 10:30pm-after having to also wait 20 minutes just to be seated in the mezzanine for drinks as we continued to wait..",3
"So much potential for this restaurant.¬† Food was hit and miss, my tuna tartare was excellent as well as my steaks were cooked perfectly¬† (had the 12 oz Dry Aged 35 Days Centre Cut Striploin from Rockwood asked for rare as well as the Japanese, Kagoshima, A5 asked at medium) but the sides and dessert were just okay, which is not what you expect from a 5-star restaurant. 

While the restaurant was nicely decorated nothing told me I was dining in a castle. I think their idea of al fresco dining in the warmer months is fantastic especially overlooking Castle Loma's beautiful¬† gardens. 

And this is the first time I have to say something about the seating at a restaurant. The seating would be great were Blueblood a lounge only but it is not and eating was awkward. If you sat back like the seating invites you to do, you are too far away from the table but sitting closer gave me no comfort. Honestly a good cushion at my back would've helped A LOT. And then the height of the chair was another problem. It was a little to high for the table *or the table was too low* which probably wouldn't be a big deal but given the awkward seating in the first place, it doesn't help.

The major plus for Blueblood Steakhouse is the staff. From the person taking care of the valet--$15 which I have no qualms paying. That's actually cheaper than average at other top restaurants--to the hostesses to my server to the ones bussing the tables, I found all to be courteous, professional and I liked their overall enthusiasm about working there.

Because the restaurant is still in its infancy I would like to return in a few months to see if things have improved.

Right now the only way I can recommend Blueblood Steakhouse is to say that at this point in time I can only rate it two and a half to three stars and that the restaurant is still working out the kinks. Don't expect 4-5 star dining. At least not yet.",2
"Absolutely perfect in every way!  Great food, beautiful restaurant, terrific and well trained (and experienced) staff.  A bit expensive ,,, but well worth it.  Impressive list of cocktails and whiskey plus options on quality of steaks.  They even have bottles of Louis Tre in the windows for decorations.   Highly recommended!!",4
"Great experience from start to end. The venue can not be touched. I mean, you're eating in a castle!!! Service was attentive  and lovely. The food and wine was perfect. Had a great time celebrating my boyfriends 30th. Thank you! We'll be back.",4
The food was amazing and the wine list couldn't be more perfect!,4
Poor service at the entrance to the table. Not to the level of restaurant. Mediocre appetizers (salad)  and desert ( for single) for the value. Overall service a bit to cold and impersonal fog the restaurant that is trying to gain popularity not just through DRAKE.,2
"Good Atmosphere

Good Staff

Good Food

Great Place Overall",4
I didn't know this restaurant was charging us for water I would prefer next time they let us know. Other than that it was great.,3
"Food was very very good. Service was way too slow and very subpar for prices. Our dinner reservations were for 8:30 and we had to stand in a cold room for 15 mins waiting while thr hostess had no clue as to why. Then when sat, we didn't even get our drinks till 9:30 and salads by 10! When you pay $60+ dollars for a drink, you assume that part of the inflated costs are service. A manager never came to our table once during the meal - again this is only expected because steaks are in excess of $200 for each person. We can't fault the food but restaurants at this price point usually spoil you ($1000+ for a party of 4) , not treat you like an after thought.",2
Perfect date night spot!,4
"The place was amazing, fantastic service from everyone. The food was great!",4
"We expected a lot, my wife and I, after all the hoopla in the papers. We knew the prices were steep but we wanted to risk it for something special.

The ambience was promising.

But the steaks were terrible.  We had the Striploin with bone in and we were going to share it.  It was done perfectly, just as we asked.  The meat was tough and tasteless. The cut was unexpectedly thin, about an inch or less and didn‚Äôt even look good on the plate. They took it back no questions asked and we didn‚Äôt trust on a replacement steak. So at least we got out of there without breaking the bank.

Very disappointed. I told the waiter they should visit the Harbour ‚Äú60‚Äù Steak house if they wanted to see what a steak should look and taste like.",0
Extremely overpriced for poor quality food. All food was served lukewarm or cold. Steaks not cooked to a proper medium -rare. Beautiful space and average service. Does not measure up to the other top steakhouses in the city.,0
"Food was so healthy, place is so clean. I'm glad there is the option to overspend, if you want to. 
and yet there is a huge price range, you can spend very little as well if need be. 
I am happy there, relaxed.  
I love being around proper etiquette for a change, everyone is extraordinarily beautiful there.",4
Dining in a castle‚Ä¶ enough said‚Ä¶ great food and service‚Ä¶ amazing skyline views‚Ä¶ prepare to spend $$$,3
"Our server, Dax, was great! Took the time to explain menu items and make recommendations. We had the 20oz Rib-Eye from Erin, Ontario. It was good, but not life-changing good, which was what I expected from a place like Blue Blood. The cream corn and garlic mashed potatoes were great! In a nutshell, this place is worth a visit but I'm unsure if I would be back here for steak cravings.",2
Exceleltn ambience and amazing waiter service.  My date and I had an excellent time and the food was a real treat as well.,4
"Decent place, but a bit overpriced for what you get.  Some if the decor felt out of place.  Should have made more use of the fact that it's located in Casa Loma.",2
"Beautiful ambience and decor. Come for the art - that is all. Unprofessional junior staff everywhere. Worst steak I have ever had, especially for the price. It looks like they cooked it from fridge cold because the inside was blue rare and the outside was completely dried out and leathery. We could not slice through  25% of the steak,  never mind trying to consume it. As they say, all sizzle and no steak. Will never go back, you can do much better for the price in this city.",0
Great food. Service could‚Äôve been better. Took a while to get a server to help us order drinks and additional items from the menu.,3
"My partner, & I had a fabulous dinner - we will be returning.",4
The food was very delicious and our waiter provided us with the best service. Everyone there was friendly and the restaurant is one of the most beautifully designed restaurants in Toronto.,4
Unequivocal perfection. Blue blood exceeded my expectations in all regards. I highly recommmed it,4
"Amazing, would go again",4
"The decor of this steak house is regal. Most likely the nicest venue in the city. 

Regrettably, the service is troubling. After spending almost four hours having dinner, I lacked both interest and an appetite. I am amazed that after charging $100 for a piece of steak , that service can be so non existent.

Sadly, a place that I would take no issue with the premium pricing if they could simply get their act together.
The king has gone mad if he thinks I am returning to dinner at this castle.",0
Had a great time and will be going back again. Our server was very professional and  answer all of our questions. My husband had the waygu rib eye steak and made love to it......thank you blueblood for making it a great experience.,4
Wonderful experience at Bluebloods - Service exceptional - Food Phenomenal - French Onion Soup Spectacular. Will be back often,4
"We had read the mixed reviews and were a little apprehensive, but had a wonderful evening.
Went with 3 friends and the noise level was very good, music in the background but not intrusive. 
Service was excellent. Very helpful suggestions from wine to dessert.
Food was very good, if I was being really picky, I would say the garlic mashed potatoes didn't have much garlic flavour and were a bit gluey, but we're very tasty.
Yes, cost is high, averaged $132pp, but that was from wine (glass) , appetizer ( Caesar salad for 2, shared with 4 ) dinner ( Tomohawk for 2, shared amongst 4 women was plenty) a selection of 4 sides and 2 shared desserts and an 18% tip.  Plenty of food and we were not distressed at the cost. 
I am sure we will visit again.",3
"Not up to par for a $1,000 meal for two.",2
"Wonderful ambiance.
Loved the water glasses.
The button on napkin is genius.
The wine list is amazing.
The decor is wonderful,especially the Prince painting.
The wait staff was very good.
However ~
Too expensive.
The seats are too low.
The tablets are too kitchy for this type of place.
The round cutlery is hard to hold.
The plain white plates do not befit a regal castle.
I would have though silver charger plates would be nice.
The steak knives are too big.
The truffle oil seemed off.
I did not like the cast iron plate my steak arrived in.
The sides made it difficult to cut.
The steaks need spicing up.
The dessert menu is too small.
They would not seat us in the seat we requested MANY times,weeks in advance.
I even went into the restaurant a week before to let the hostess know about seating.
They ran out of creme de cacao the night before and the drink I wanted needed it.
I did not get the drink I wanted.
They knew what they needed and did not replenish.
We were charged $40.00 for a salad and NOWHERE does it say per person.
The valet parking is $15.00. 
$5.00 more than the ,park yourself price.
Valet parking should be free at these prices.",3
"Service was superb, but I felt our server did not give good recommendation for menu. He suggested a seafood tower for appetizer when I had ordered dry red wine to pair with steak.  
Price of menu was no surprise and I did not think it was overpriced comparatively, but I thought wines were definitely over priced. most of half-bottles started at $100. 
Another downside was that the washroom did not have mirrors aside from the big mirror outside. 
As for food, I got dry aged tomahawk and the portion was big and more than enough for two women. I wouldn't say this is the best steak ever in my life, but it was one of good steaks I had in  Toronto. Dessert - castle baked alaska is AMAZING! must try! 
Overall, I was very happy with my dinner at Blueblood and definitely will come back.",3
"The food & experience were fantastic.  There were areas of improvement in our experience, but I'm still giving them a 5* review.  Prices are higher than Jacobs, but you're at the Casa Loma, what do you expect?  My father enjoyed it so much, he wants to come back for my birthday.

Service - Great.  Our server was attentive and present for most of the evening.  It was a packed dining room for a Tuesday night.  Water refills were always there.  My wife felt like they were ""trying too hard"", but I found it appropriate.

Reservation confirmations - I think we had at least 5 calls to confirm our reservation in the week leading up to our dinner.  Way too much for my liking.

Ambience - It's Casa Loma, definitely a cool place to be.  Add curtains to the windows to block the sun!

Dinner length - We arrived at 5:30 and didn't get out till around 8.  Far too long for our liking.

Food - !! Mmmmm...

Tableside Caesar - As my father would say, ""better than Jacob's!""
French Onion Soup - Small, but intensely flavourful! I'd say that's the best French Onion Soup I've ever had.
Oysters - Very fresh, some of the better ones in the city.
Foie gras, carpaccio, steak tartare - A solid showing, but far from best.  I'd actually say these were disappointing based on price & standards.
Steaks - We had Australian wagyu, and Canadian steaks at the table.  For Canadian steaks, they were fantastic, best I've had.
Fries - The biggest fries we've ever had.  Each fry felt like the size of 4 Kit-Kat bars stacked in a 2x2 formation.
Cognac Peppercorn sauce - Recommended by server, and it was amazing.
Sea bass - They gave the whole fish.  Wow.  Great value here.
Baked Alaska - A great show for dessert.
Poached Peach - Good.",4
The overall experience was amazing service was impeccable but the only bad part was our server was a little off key didn‚Äôt seem to fit in and get the full hospitality we assumed we be receiving at this venue .,3
"Unfortunately we waited 45 minutes for our table and just asked to wait on the side. 
I believe the restaurant is new and getting the hang of the timing, however, at many good restaurants you are offered a complimentary glass of wine while waiting. This would have helped our group pass the time.",3
Truly an unbelievable experince. Menu is detalied handcrafted and service was over the top!!,4
"It was our first time here, the ambiance is nice, sort of dark and cozy. Feels like a mans restaurant. Steak was great, burger was little oily",4
"I have long wanted to see a fine dining restaurant at Casa Loma so I was excited to take my family there for a special occasion.   It is over-priced.   Bottles of wine began at $100.  I was charged $20 for my favourite cocktail.   The steaks began at $65--but then you had to purchase sides!  My daughters shared a $35 hamburger and fries.

The atmosphere is charming and the service was impeccable.  I would like to see this restaurant succeed but I don't believe it will at those prices.",2
Great food and ambiance. Friendly staff and table side Caesar salad was awesome.,4
"Had an amazing time!! Our server Quinton made our first time there memorable and we will definetly be back. Food was amazing, service was impeccable, atmosphere was fantastic for  the wife's birthday.",4
The service was impeccable.  Every food and drink item we had were impeccable.   I think it's a little presumptuous to have the debit machine preprogrammed to leave a tip of 18% or 20%.  That being said it is completely appropriate that the servers be tipped at that level given their knowledge and high standard of service. Excellent all around.,4
they seem to be still working out the kinks when it comes to service,2
Over rated!!! Beautiful inside but way to hot. Steak wasn't cooked properly.,2
In a word...terrible....only open a short time and they have a lot of issues to work out...everything is 2-3 times overpriced...paid $250 for a bottle of wine I can buy for $50 online...server was nice and very apologetic but it was the worst $600 meal I have ever had...very disappointed,1
"Got to come here twice within a week. I was able to try all the appetizers. They have a good list of apps compared to Jacobs and Co. The must get is the scallop civiche, braised shortrib rivoli & tableside caesar salad. The list of steak is smaller compared to Jacobs though so I still prefer to dine at Jacobs but I would definitely come back here for the ambience. Its unique that its apart of the casa loma so its picture worthy. Overall food is good, service is fine our server was busy serving alot if tables and doing the tableside items like the salad n dessert so maybe they shud designate another person to help with that.",4
"Ohtstanding food and service.   Emily was amazing!!!!!
Truly an experience in a stunning location.",4
The most incredible steak house I‚Äôve ever been to. The staff were amazing,4
"Loved the atmosphere, the decor and especially the food.  Service was outstanding.  My new favourite restaurant!",4
"Well where to start. I knew that this would be an expensive meal and indeed it was. I visited Casa Loma with my wife and two kids, 19 & 13.  We looked at the menu before going just to get the shell shock over and done with. 
My wife ordered the French onion soup as an app and she said it was the best she had ever had, small bowl $14. My kids and I stuck with the free bread with truffle oil and a savoury butter, very nice. 
As our mains we my wife and I got the rib eye steak, cooked well but too fatty for me not worth the $65 for 14oz, just the steak. The waiter should have mentioned that the sides, $16 for a potatoe, could feed two. I ordered the table side ceasar salad, way too much garlic, thinking it was $20, when the bill came it was actually $80, $20 each, yup, $80 for 4 side salads. 
Waiters cleaned down the table after the apps and took my free bread, not happy about that as I still wanted it. After the mains came the waiter asked it everything tasted good, normal, then 30 secs later another one came and asked, then another. I joked to the wife that because they don't necessarily have one designated waiter they don't communicate, 30 seconds later the 4th guy came and asked the same question, funny. My daughters had the Cornish hen, great. Also the scallops and mac n cheese, also great. 
Dessert was a $5 small americano coffee and the frozen Alaska. This is a small ice cream Yule log covered in meringue and set on fire table side, $28, not worth it. 
Total bill $456 plus tip $525. I would choose the Keg over Blue Blood sadly",3
Early days for the restaurant so hopefully will improve over time.,1
"Had better value diner with $340...  Exceptional quality food with great service... Therefore, I still tip well added $40 tip to the costed:)",1
"Absolutely a great experience at BlueBlood! Date night to celebrate my wife‚Äôs birthday and everything was on point.  The restaurant even had a happy birthday card at our table for her. The food was amazing, steaks just perfection. It‚Äôs a beautiful place too so overall ambiance and experience is worth it.",4
"Dined at BlueBlood yesterday evening, where upon arriving we were told we had to valet our car since all public parking was taken due to their Halloween Haunted House and a wedding. You would have thought that parking would be set aside for patrons with reservations over haunted house goers. Moreover, these two events also compromised the ambience within the restaurant, including incredibly long line-ups for the restroom. In terms of dining, we were rushed to order our appetizers and entrees at the same time because the kitchen was running an hour wait time. We ordered the table side caesar salad, which took almost 20 minutes to arrive and it is not explicitly mentioned on the menu that it is $20 per person. For entrees, I had the tuna which was prepared nicely and my fiancee had the salmon, which was quite salty. We also had the asparagus, and gorgonzola gnocchi - not bad, but not phenomenal. As many others have mentioned in their reviews, the service was disorganized and there is lack of rapport. Finally, beware of the tipping  as it is programmed to tip on the total (with tax), not subtotal. I realize this issue has arose at other high end restaurants in Toronto, and BlueBloods is no different. Overall, pretty disappointing and doesn't compare well to other steakhouses in the city.",2
"Top notch service in the beautiful casaloma. The food was very well prepared and beautifully presented. Cocktails were very creative and yummy. 
The dinning room is very dark. It was difficult to read the menu. The wine list is very limited in the low end, so if you plan to have a bottle they start at $75 and jump quickly to $150+",3
"We had a great time at BlueBlood for my boyfriend's birthday. We both ordered steak which came out perfectly and we shared the spinach and gnocchi sides which were delicious. The sommelier was very knowledgeable and answered all of our questions, even though they didn't all relate to the wine we ordered. While the price was a bit expensive, it was well worth it for the overall experience, we even got taken on a tour and the wait staff let us end our night walking through the haunted house at no extra cost.",4
"7:30 reservations but not seated until 8:15. Mediocre food,
Particularly for the price point. Service quite good but a bit disorganized.",1
"wait staff needs lots of training, very poor service.. food does not compare with other good steakhouses and very overpriced.",1
"Food was delicious, staff was terrific and the room is gorgeous.....very expensive.",4
"This is the first time in my life that I have left zero tip; I usually tip 20% or more. The meat was good, however the rest of the food was hit or miss with soggy salads and over-salted kale. But what brought the place crashing down for us was the absolutely inhospitable, infrequent and inattentive service.

4 of us are executives in luxury hotel and dining, so we know what to expect. We asked to speak with the manager who was apologetic and comped some drinks (about a 10% bill reduction) but vehemently defended the server as his best, and insisted that our table was the only one with any issues. I would have expected the comp to at least include the food items we complained about and a change of server.

Just a few of the many issues:
- server was brusque and looking around the room while talking to us - it felt like we weren't important enough to warrant his attention. He kept forgetting the order NEVER cracked a smile.
- a broken chair,  that was only replaced after being indicated multiple times over an hour. We also had to keep asking for service with long waits.
- salads that were brought to the table with the cheese missing. When we advised the server, we were slowly brought out a small cup of cheese to add to our half eaten dishes. I would have expected the salad to be removed and replaced afresh
- sides were not brought out together despite being specifically asked for. We actually felt they forgot to ring two of them in as they only arrived much later
- the wine list is confusing, on a tablet that is too bright. We asked for a printed version or to reduce the brightness; neither was possible. The sommelier's attitude made it clear that he did not expect us to spend enough money to warrant his attention
- still water poured into our sparkling multiple times and when indicated, not replaced with a fresh glass

The room is gorgeous so if you can handle average, overpriced food with the most rude and inattentive service in Toronto, check out this place.",0
"It was to die for. I loved all of it. It was time Casa Loma did this. 
I watched it from the time I was in Brownies, and the Boy Scouts had their run of the place (40 years ago), to the catered in thanksgiving and Christmas time buffets, but this tops it. 

I was saying to the waitress, it seems a prerequisite to work for this place is to be extraordinarily beautiful. All were polite, well mannered, professional. The food, the sea bass was the best I ever had in my life.  I used to catch fish as a kid and none of my bass tasted that good, fresh from Lake Simcoe. 
K! Hugs, I love you all. :) I wouldn't change a thing. 

Well one thing....I would change your window cleaner. I know they were clean, but the cleaner  left streaks, noticeable when the sun was setting. The place was immaculate and clean none the less in every other aspect. I was surprised to see the women and mens washroom are in the same room, but it was elegantly done, in a limited space. 

Bottom line, price was just right for the quality.",4
"Blue Bloods is as magical as the castle itself! Your staff made us feel like queens and the food is unbelievably well presented and exceptional. The history,artwork,statue and wine cellar tour was all worth the long anticipated wait, I can't wait to go back! 
Thanks so much for the wonderful memory xoxo",4
Found the food very bland and tasteless. At best the experience was so-so. Disappointing considering the price of dining there. Was hoping for a memorable dining experience on the night I proposed.,1
Excellent food and service. Wouldn't expect anything but from Liberty group.,4
Warm and friendly staff from the moment you enter until the moment you leave.  Our server Sheila was amazing. The food was  absolutely delicious and surpassed all expectations.  Looking forward to returning in the near future.,4
Stunning setting. Beautiful decor.  Pleasant staff.  Food - average.  Price - absurdly expensive.,2
"This had to have been one of the worst steaks I've ever had. We ordered the Porterhouse medium-rare and it arrived well done and charred on the one side of the bone, and blue on the other. I still cannot figure out how they managed to pull this off on a single cut of meat.

To management's credit, they did take the charge off our bill and offered us a replacement. Unfortunately we had to make a show and didn't have time to wait for a new steak. Ended up throwing a frozen pizza in the oven when we got home after the show... at midnight.

The setting and atmosphere is great, as was the staff. Service was friendly and attentive. Unfortunately, it was all for naught when the star of the show disappoints on such an epic scale.

I hope that this was an anomaly or that they learn how to cook a steak properly because I would really like to see this restaurant do well. The Casa Loma is a tourist destination and I expect Blueblood Steakhouse to represent our city well.",1
Everything was fantastic. Our server Anthony was friendly and his service was outstanding.  We took a nice tour of the wine cellar. It was a wonderful evening overall.,4
The staff were so incredible! They treated us like royalty. The food was delish and the castle decor was magical.,4
"Loved the atmosphere of Blue Bloods, our waiter was great and the perfect choice for an anniversary dinner. Plus one of the best steaks I've had in a while. Will go back again.",4
"A Unique dinning experience in Majestic Casa Loma. BlueBlood offers an extensive menu for all, including pescatarians with its delightful sides and unlimited choices of drinks , wine and cocktails all while in a posh setting. The Staff was attentive and gave superb service.  Cannot wait to go back!",4
"Very generous portions. Tables a little crowded and you can overhear other conversations. I wish there were more opportunities to take pictures and use casa loma as a backdrop. 
Washrooms on the lower level are not heels-friendly",3
It is a new restaurant so I'll give them a pass on their service kinks. The salmon crudo was half delicious half inedible (the skin was sucked of all its flavour and dehydrated to a rigid plastic). Tuna tartare was standard. Short rib ravioli a bit dry. The mains were thoroughly fantastic (burgers steaks and ribs). The mushrooms and onion sides were a little lack lustre. I enjoyed the broccolini. The baked Alaska is very boozy despite our server telling us the prosecco foam was on the side. Cheesecake and profiterole were perfect.,3
Service was top notch. The steaks were well worth the value and cooked nicely (I think they may sous vide prior to searing?).  Braised short rib was delicious. The sides were good but not great. It got noisier later in the evening.,4
We really enjoyed our anniversary this weekend. The food is very good but the location is fantastic. The dessert was one of the best we had ever tasted.,4
"A perfect evening. The service was great, very attentive and engaging. Food was wonderful from appetizers to dinner.  We were too full for dessert.",4
Everything was amazing in one of the coolest atmospheres I've had the pleasure of dining in. This was a home run!,4
"We went during the weekday to celebrate a birthday month which was very quiet, great if you were trying to have a nice conversation without having to shout over each other in most restaurants. The ambience was fantastic, service was amazing from the hostess to the servers. Menu was nice and simple, food all came at once, we ordered steak, wagyu burger, a starch and dessert. Accompanied with two glasses of red wine. The steak was amazing, one of the best steaks I've had! We ordered the baked Alaska for dessert upon recommendation. Which came with a little table side show which was awesome! Before the bill arrive we were offered chocolates from a box, great way to finish a nice meal! Will definitely come back!",4
"I have been to Casa Loma previously just to see the castle so once I found out there was a new steakhouse I had to drive up from Buffalo, NY to try it. It was a second date for me and once we pulled up, it had my date in awe. It was the most pleasurable evening I have had at a restaurant, it had a certain elegance and it created a special night.",4
Fantastic all the way around. Price paid was worth the experience.,4
"I knew I'd like this restaurant when the hostess at the door said I really like your jacket, and she meant it.   The first reception inside was welcome and please enjoy your stay with us.  We even had a tour because we were there early and the first dinner guests.  The  Andy Warhol art, the pictures of the Queen and Prince (funky and fun) and the decor so beautifully defined.   It was an honour to eat in the castle and the food top notch and the waiters down to earth and generous with their time.  I thoroughly enjoyed every moment.  My husband went through some stressful times with Hurricane Irma and I wanted to do something nice.  BlueBlood Steakhouse was perfect.",4
Fantastic meal. A must if you live in Toronto,4
"Very nice setting... all 6 steaks were burnt on the outside and not cooked thru on the inside, service was very good, manager vey nice...very awkward to get to the washrooms...One of the highest prices in the city, I am sure it will get better in time...",2
"First, the bar was lovely and bar manager, Oliver, as well as rest of bar staff, were most personable and knowledgeable   We moved to Oak Room for dinner, where there was a noticeable over-abundance of serving staff, who milled about quite a bit.  The dinner was a big disappointment, with exception of scallops, which were quite good.  Food seemed pretentious, was over-sauced, over-salted, and, definitely overpriced.  Wine list very over-priced and offered no selections, by bottle or glass, which enticed because of exorbitant cost ( there were some stellar selections, to be sure, but not for everyday dining.  Dessert menu did not impress.",2
"I would recommend this restaurant for anything.  It is fantastic, beautiful, staff is amazing and everything about it us outstanding.    
Can't wait to go back.
Anita Rapp",4
"Quiet restaurant with beautifully presented  food. My fianc√© and I were here for a birthday and the service was impeccable - our server was wonderfully friendly and always around to answer questions. Entr√©e food  would be slightly better if the portions were bigger, and (not sure it was just us) but would have appreciated if we didn't have to pay for the flat-rate parking to eat at the restaurant (we also didn't bother to ask about this). Would highly recommend the appetizers - and a definite must-go for all those foodies, or those planning special occasions.",3
"Perfect night!! Food was delicious, service was good, place is beautiful !",4
Gorgeous inside. Great service. We were well taken care of.,4
Beautifully decorated restaurant with a menu for all palates. Has a great swanky vibe.,3
"This is a beautiful steakhouse in the West End of Casa Loma. The d√©cor is stunning. The service is a bit mixed, even though there were at least a dozen waiters etc. in our area. We ordered a glass of champagne and had to remind them 5 or 10 minutes later to bring it. The wine list is extensive but expensive at about a 3 times markup. My wife had the Nebraska barrel cut filet, which was one of the best she (or I) have ever eaten. I ordered the Japanese Kagoshima Wagyu striploin and when the food arrived it was at least one third grizzle, not acceptable for a $150 6 oz. steak. They graciously replaced it with another, but by the time it arrived my wife had finished eating, not a very romantic dinner at that point. There was no offer of any compensation for the screwup, like a glass of wine or a couple of chocolates. In fact it was very disappointing to go to such a restaurant and not receive an amuse bouche compliments of the chef before the meal or anything at the end of the meal. Admittedly they have not been open long but with prices like they charge expectations are high and the expectations were not met. The service and attention to detail needs to be ""kicked up a lot of notches"".",2
Wine list hard to read on the iPad they give you. To many categories to go through. Steak tartare was bland with the garlic bread the only thing you could taste. Foie Gras was decedent and a nice portion. Steak was well cooked. The sauce that we got with it was a small tablespoon at the most and a disappointment for $5. Mashed potatoes were cold. Got a second and they were cold also. Mushrooms were ok but nothing to write home about. The C√©sar salad down table side took a very very very long time to come and was disappointing with soggy croutons. The atmosphere really makes this place worth going to. Very nice!,2
"Was excited to try, first night so many issues might be related to that (lighting levels constantly changing, etc) but disappointed in a lot of areas. Design is great, room looks fantastic, little touches beautiful (ros√© gold cutlery, etc). Very attentive service with tons of staff but lacking some of the basics like getting cutlery for your salad (had to ask), getting drink order wrong, clearing one plate but putting down another with oil on bottom so oil on table, all the food arrived at exactly the same time, clearing too quickly (felt like at least twice someone offered to take seafood tower away when it was still about 40% full), some staff were clearly excellent (somelier and french waiter who didn't handle our table but stopped by twice) and some not at all in tune to high end service details. Steaks were excellent as were side dishes, Caesar (tableside) was way too salty (Octogan does a much better version), seafood tower was ok but have had way better with more flavour (La Banane), dessert menu very limited if you want something on the simpler side. Same rough pricing as other steakhouses (Morton's, etc) but not consistent enough in quality or flavour to justify price. Consider the number of managers and ownership and how the place was not very busy we were quite surprised that no manager or senior person ever checked on our table. Nice note when we arrived for our son's birthday. Hope they work out kinks as Toronto does need more cool steakhouse options now that NAO is closed.",1
"Everything in the restaurant was excellent from the music, French Onion Soup, to the Steak. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone visiting Toronto.",4
"We've been to Keg's York several times but last night was exceptional. Everything seemed to align, from our server Stephen Longdon to the pacing and taste of the food and wine we ordered (three of us, my wife, me and a friend). Stephen actually made a major difference. His professionalism, attentiveness, patience, and friendly demeanor truly made our evening special. It was seamless. In addition to the outstanding service, the meal itself was exceptional, thanks in no small part to Stephen's suggestion. Thank you for your exceptional service. We look forward to returning to the Keg in the future and hope to have the pleasure of being served by you again. our Thank you for going above and beyond to make our evening at the Keg so enjoyable.",4
"So good, Steven the server is a top class server and person. He‚Äôs gonna go places with that attitude!",4
"We absolutely love the keg, but we noticed a few small  details. I found that the ladies in the front of house didn't greet us very friendly. Even just a smile would have been appreciated. It was a special night and overall we had a great time. The Manager Stephanie was so pleasant and gave us a birthday cake and a card! That meant so much. Thanks!",3
Lively place with excellent customer service from the moment you walk in to sitting down to have your meal to when you leave.  Awesome!,4
One of the nicest of the Keg chain of restaurants. Meal was tasty and well presented. Service could be a little more attentive.,3
Lovely late afternoon meal - steak ü•© was as requested and service with a big smile!,4
The dinner was great and the server was excellent. You never have a bad dinner at the Keg. Unfortunately while leaving someone had fallen down puking all over the floor right near the front entrance of the restaurant. Took down the ambiance a notch. These things happen though; it's all good.,3
"Over cooked steaks, stale veggies. Servers were very nice and attentive though.",2
La nourriture √©tait excellente comme toujours. Le serveur √©tait amicale et courtois. Vraiment appr√©ci√© notre exp√©rience,3
"Good service, attentive waitress and good food. What‚Äôs not to like!",4
"Beautiful restaurant. It was very busy so we had to wait 20 mins for a table but we were 10 mins late for our reservation too. Lots of ppl were still ahead of us waiting so I don't think it would have mattered much. When making the reservation I had indicated that this was an engagement celebration and neither the hostess or our waiter took note of it or even asked us if we were there to celebrate anything. We didn't mention it because there wasn't an opportunity to but so we thought this was quite inconsiderate and sort of dampened our celebration. We had just gotten engaged an hour earlier.
Overall, our waiter seemed new but still polite, just not very engaging . Food was great as always but service could have been better.",2
"Requested outside seating, then  changed mind due to chilly weather. Key was very accommodating and were seated inside. Service was great. Lots to choose from on menu. Only regret , selected mushroom rice as a side and found it to be very bland (no flavour at all) will skip this side in any future visits.",3
We enjoyed the experience! .. waiter was pleasant and the food was good along with the sangria!,4
"Excellente viande de b≈ìuf, parfaitement cuite √† notre go√ªt, service diligent et aimable,
Un peu saisis par le niveau sonore en entrant, mais secteur resto plus calme et tr√®s cosy",4
Service was OK. Nothing special. Food is not that good. Ordered 2 steaks both medium and it came almost medium well. Not tender and juicy at all.,1
"Dined here based on the great reviews but we were gravely disappointed. Didnt expect to have a steak the quality and taste of Ruth‚Äôs Chris, but the ribeye was so subpar in quality and taste. It was also served luke warm. Highlight was the veggies served with it as they were cooked perfectly. The prime rib was served hard and tough as wood. Wth? Why would someone even serve it like that? Sent it back and the mgr apologized and comp‚Äôd a shrimp app which was nice. The shrimp were cooked perfectly but served in enough butter & oil to clog the arteries & cause an immediate heart attack if we didnt soak it off. The ambiance was nice and it was quiet at 5pm when we dined. The service was horrible too. Our waiter Skylar acted less than enthusiastic about his job and/or serving us. Never introduced himself bit got his name off the receipt, never came back to check on us or see if we needed anything, had a flag down other servers to get what we needed about 3 times, never refilled out empty water carafe, he just disappeared. Waited 15 min after finishing the meal before we asked someone to have him bring the check. Again the manager that came by was very pleasant and kind, but the server was trash and the tip I left reflected the service he provided. Needless to say we wont be dining here ever again in Toronto or Montreal. Total waste of money, time and calories. They didnt even acknowledge the birthday celebration indicated in my reservation. We dine out 4-5 days/week in sit down restaurants and this was THE MOST HORRIBLE experience we‚Äôve had in years as this place failed in every category except ambiance. Do yourself a favor and dine elsewhere. Plenty of other enjoyable places to go.",0
Service was good.  Food was delicious and plentiful.,4
"Good atmosphere and good service, but food was just ok.",2
Cesar salad was crap.  Romaine was old and brown. No bacon bits   Just lettuce and dressing with 4 croutons for whole salad.    Very underwhelming,2
"Great experience for our anniversary. The server went above and beyond, and all the food was cooked perfectly.",4
"Quality service, quality food, value for money and lovely setting",4
Our hostess was absolutely amazing.   Friendly and helpful and so nice.  I do not remember her  name but she has long dark hair and young and is Greek lol.,4
"Lovely food, reasonably priced, friendly staff, and an extra special touch as we were celebrating two wedding anniversaries.",4
"Nice dinner at the Keg on York Street in Toronto. Very consistent, very good steaks, met all of our expectations.",4
"Probably the best steak I've ever had. Our service was outstanding, from the people to the food I had the best time at the keg.",4
Food was not great this visit - meat was tough.  Service was excellent.,3
"Our server was excellent to say the least.
The location itself could probably use a facelift and it is so dark but otherwise its all fine",3
"Food was ok, service slow and cutlery not spotless",3
Our service was absolutely amazing!! We enjoyed his energy and warm attitude!,4
"It was a very god expereince, lovely atmosphere, delicious food, courteous staff",4
"We had a nice meal outside but there were a few mice running around right beside our table.  We told the waitress about it and her reply was, ‚Äúyes we know.   We are outside after all‚Äù.",2
"We have an excellent server for our evening. She was outstanding and very helpful!

Thank you!",4
"Great KEG location, always good service. My steak was a bit dry and overdone this time, and it took longer than usual I felt. Still, a good steak place with reasonable prices.",3
Service was amazing!! The french onion soup is seriously tasty! 8 ounce sirloin steak was cooked to perfection!,4
Food was cold and prices getting too high for a chain,2
"The server was very friendly and informative. One person had egg and nut allergies and the manager (Matthew) came out to discuss specific menu food items and hidden allergens which was super helpful and reassuring. Portions were good and one person decided against an entree after the Calamari appetizer which was a generous size. It was a short walk to Scotiabank Arena where we were heading for a concert. Even though TIff, concerts and a Blue Jays game were happening it wasn't hard to get a reservation. All in all a great night and I will definitely be returning.",4
Service was great! Food was wonderful. An overall great experience!!,3
Wonderful evening concluding our East Canada holiday tour. Service great and the food just as expected. Hard to beat.,4
"I went here for my birthday, and the service was outstanding. I have a nut allergy and the team had the kitchen manager come speak to me directly about how they resuce the changes of cross contamination and their kitchen protocols. Food was perfect, and this was a great meal. I will recomend this location always!",4
Lovely outdoor patio with shade while I was there between 1pm & 2:30pm.  The food is consistently good and the service is very good.,3
Good steaks for a good value. Our server (Rio) was tops.,4
The store manager and server are very friendly. Tuna Tartar and Prime Rib Sandwich are very tasty. Recommend.,3
"I booked my appointment at 6:oo p.m., but I arrived there around 5:45 p.m.. The restaurant was pretty empty on Labour Day. However, I was arranged to sit on a very small table in a dark corner. Since it had a lot of tables available, why didn't the staff give me a bigger space to enjoy my anniversary dinner. I requested for another table, the front desk staff looked to be not willing to do anything. I had to explain it to her for over 6 minutes, finally she changed it. When I left around 7:05 p.m., many tables were not occupied. I hope the staff can do better arrangement next time.",2
Food in a very high quality. Meat very tender. With Kevin a good waiter. Enjoyed our stay very much.,4
"I really appreciate the customer service. Team work was very evident at this location. I didn‚Äôt get a ‚Äúyou are not my table, wait on your own server‚Äù type of vibe. Everyone was working to help on another. 

Very sweet manager (Charmaine? I think her name was. 

Great location and great food‚Äî-I would go again.",4
Lovely table for two off the passageway and service quick and efficient.Noise level fine after fire alarm fixed but overall no problem recommending,3
"A little disappointed with our server. They didn't come to check in when we start our first bite, like most do. They were very friendly and courteous, but maybe had an off night with the usual service The Keg offers.
Would we go back? Of course! We love The Keg!",3
Nice atmosphere and delicious food. I also enjoyed the chill music in the background and the outstanding service. Thank you for making our dinner experience and special occasion memorable.,3
Seated promptly and greeted by a very cheery waitress. Ordered drinks and these followed swiftly. Well presented and a good choice available. Food was excellent and the steaks were cooked impeccably. Really cannot find any fault at all. Extremely happy,4
"Great service, great food. Not loud allowing for conversation.",3
"Came for my daughters bday and as usual our food was amazing hot, fresh, cooked perfect, great presentation. Our waiter was polite and let us know all the specials , afterwards he came over with the billy miner pie with a candle in it for my daughter . We come to this location all the time and absolutely love it Thank you so much",4
The food and service far exceeded our expectations. It was memorable and special! Looking forward to our next times!,3
"The food was incredible and the service was great, however, I am not sure why this location asked if the reservation was a special occasion if they aren‚Äôt going to acknowledge it.
It was my anniversary and I mentioned that in the comments and no one said anything to me, not the host or server. I found this quite upsetting as I thought this would be a great place to hold a special occasion. After this I will definitely rethink coming here for any future events.",4
"Very delicious Food and wine!
It was not my first time and for sure not my last",4
"Excellent service. Ordered the steak sandwich, portion was extremely small and nonexistent mushroom and onions. Keg used to be good value but seems to be slipping",2
Fabulous server. Salad was over dressed. Was drowning and I had to give it mouth to mouth to revive it.,4
First time at the Keg and I was quite impressed. From the front counter all the way to the time I left I felt comfortable. Food was great. I ordered the steak and lobster tail. Everything was great! Will be returning when I get back to Toronto.,4
"The food was very good; a colleague's steak was undercooked, and the manager came to talk to us about it despite not complaining or sending it back. He noticed it, and addressed it unprompted. I was very impressed with the level of service.",4
It was a lovely touch to be wished a happy anniversary and receive a complimentary dessert x,4
"I needed to get some work done and sat at the bar with my iPad. The service was stellar. The lobster gratin√©e was perfect! When my steak was overcooked a bit, they remade and took care of me quickly. Thanks to the bar team that served me and manager Matthew this was a great experience.",4
"Great service, great food! Super energetic atmosphere! Will definitely be back.",4
"Great Food, Fabulous ambiance. Great Service , decent Wine List",4
"We had very good time and nice food. 
I will go back with my family.",4
"Essen war sehr gut,ausser the baked potatos waren sehr trocken. Service und Ambiente toll.
Gerne wieder.",3
"I ordered filet mignon and it's the first time being to the Keg that I had to question if it was actually a filet mignon.  I sent the steak back with the waitress.  The manager came over with a fresh plate and assured me that it was a filet mignon.  I couldn't even see the bacon on the first piece.  Filet mignon as I have known it for decades is small but thick and wrapped in bacon.  This piece of steak, although was very good was not shaped like a filet mignon.

The music was loud.  Had to shout to have a discussion with someone sitting beside me.",3
"Great food nice place. Good location..,,,,;‚Ä¶,,,,,,,,,,,",4
"Great food and great service ‚ò∫Ô∏è

The patio was a great spot this time of year!",4
"I can‚Äôt remember my waiters name but he was absolutely amazing !! The vibe was top tier ,he made my birthday dinner really enjoyable.The food was was amazing and prepared to perfection.I sat outside and the ambience was great!I will be returning !",4
Excellent as the Keg always is. Beautiful patio in the back of the restaurant. Staff always helpful and attentive..Thank you,4
"The waitress was very nice & polite. Service was excellent, the food was perfect as well.",4
"The thing that stands out most to me about The Keg is consistency!  I have been to several locations across the country and have always experienced similar service, delicious food and fantastic ambiance!  We love it!",4
"Excellent as always, but a little noisy‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..",4
"Nice lunch on the patio. Excellent service and good food except, unfortunately, the steaks. Tough meat.
What a spoiler for an otherwise delightful meal.",3
I found the meals inconsistent. I had a fabulous medium rate prime rib on Wednesday night. Thursday night I had a medium rate prime rib. The prime rib cut was very scrapy incomparison to wednesday night. The atmosphere is always lovely but find it hard to talk at the table due to back ground noise due to the high ceilings. The servers were amazing both times and very attentive without being intrusive. Billy pie is amazing as always but will probably not order again because it is rather expensive add on to the meal. I would recommend to a friend as it is convenient located to the Sheraton and the table service is excellent.,4
"I always eat at the Keg when I visit toronto. The food, drinks and service are always a consistently high standard.",4
"The Keg has great ambience, amazing food and excellent service.",4
got my whole order wrong. Had to wait for it to come back while other person had thier meal,2
I have great night there with my parent. The food is amazing and absolutely worth the price.,4
Our server was excellent and the food was amazing!,4
We enjoyed the back patio for a quick bite. Great service and was nice that the Culinary Manager Brian came to the table to discuss my son‚Äôs allergies.,4
"Server Stephen was fantastic! 
Tuna Tartare  was delicious.",4
"Food came out quickly and cooked perfectly. The server ended up being an old friend from junior high (great seeing you again, Ted!) and was very friendly and helpful. We sat on the back patio which was great. Overall fantastic experience.",4
"Unfortunately one of the meals had a bad potato which was replaced but new one didn‚Äôt have butter as requested & extremely dry.
Turn around ti resolve problems was slow so partner had to eat first.
Staff where very accommodating and apologized plus provided free dessert.
This is the first time with an issue at this location so will certainly return and assume it was a one if.",1
The food was excellent; our favourite place from now on.,4
Consistently exceeds expectations.   The service always amazes me at how good it is.  Kudos to you!,4
Food was good as normal. Our server was fantastic.,4
Our server was knowledgeable and explained the specials. Our food came at appropriate times (we didn‚Äôt feel rushed). Everything was cooked to perfection.,4
Great value for the money. Food was delicious and the service was fantastic. We really enjoyed our waiter. Class act.,4
"Food was excellent, server very attentive. We had a very good time.",4
Service was slower than expected but the food was very good.,2
We were seated at an area where we waited for 10 mins before I had to go to the hostess area looking for our server.  Turned out hostess sat us at a closed section.  Needless to say experience was not top notch .,1
"Emma was amazing!!

The rib steak was perfectly cooked and very tender. The bacon wrapped scallops were also a favourite!",4
"Excellent service, quiet table, not super spacious. Waitress was fantastic, brought a complimentary dessert for our anniversary celebration! Thanks so much!",4
"Ryan, the bartender, and Sara my frequent server, were excellent as usual .",4
"Everything was amazing no problems with the meal or Server. 

The problem that I have is that the Ladies Washroom leaves a lot to be desired for sure the sinks and counters were clean, but the stalls were very very dirty including up the walls of the stalls and the doors as well. I will also mention that there is so much dust on the bottom of the hinges that if it was wider I could write my name on it. 
This needs to be addressed immediately please as it leaves a bad taste in my mouth and would definitely stop me from returning to this location in the future.",4
Our most recent dinner at the Keg on York Street was exceptional from start to finish. My fiancee advised the server of a food allergy and was provided with all of the information she needed to make an informed choice and the Keg was most agreeable to substitute as needed. A short time later the Food Quality Manager approached the table to review the order placed and offer up some other alternatives. This genuine care was most appreciated and removed the normal angst associated with choosing a dinner while paying attention to one's own specific food allergies. Both of our meals were exquisite and prepared to perfection. The entire experience was exceptional and very much appreciated.,4
A wonderful experience as always... I never hesitate to come here for dinner when I'm visiting Toronto... consistency is key and the Keg always delivers that in spades,4
C‚Äô√©tait parfait ‚Äò moi et mes amis nous avons appr√©ci√© le cadre .,4
Our service was amazing! The food was pretty good. Steaks were great and sides were just okay.,3
Food was great and they went above making sure my sons food allergy was taken care of.,4
Liked the non alcoholic cocktails available They were delicious !,3
Server was amazing - very personable and genuine. A great experience overall!,4
Super pleasant server. A small issue was resolved immediately and we were treated with respect.,4
"Steaks cooked to perfection- lobster butter perfectly creamy and better the ""new way"" for sure! Matt was personable, available and effficient without hovering- great relaxing patio evening for my Mom surrounded by the awesome York street staff :)",4
"We visited The Keg on York Street on a recommendation and were not disappointed. The service from Paddy was friendly and attentive throughout our visit. The food was excellent. We'd recommend the caesar salad, strip steak, salmon with pistachio crust and the blackened chicken. The mini creme brulee was a tasty treat to end the meal on. Great choice of wine and speciality coffees too.",4
"Absolutely fabulous evening, food was amazing & really great server Suzanna who took the extra time to talk everything through with us & chat with us.  Our son tried lobster for the first time & Suzannas service just made it that little extra special.  Steaks were absolutely perfect & desserts just topped the whole night off.  Honestly one of our best meals out, would highly recommend.",4
Beautiful ü§© restaurant definitely worth going to.,4
"Visiting from Florida.  First time to The Keg.   Seated promptly.   Service by Ashlyn was outstanding!  She made great recommendations, checked back frequently, good conversation about the local area.  Food was delivered quickly & prepared correctly.   Excellent!!!!",4
"We booked a Summer dinner evening on the lovely back patio for three. It was sublime. Our guest was being treated to a delicious meal, great ambiance, and good company. The server was polite but not intrusive. Thank you to the chefs and staff for a great evening out.üçæüëç",4
Super good food the service was good and did not judge me even I am a guy who like to dresses I would definitely be back  good end of a tirp lunch  thx,4
Best steak and service:) food was very fast coming out,4
"Our server Susan (I guess is her name) amazing service she gave us, to be honest she was super worries if we need something or not, my father birthday cake amazing‚Ä¶KEG in york st. again 10/10",4
"amazing food, amazing customer service, beautiful place, fair pricing. Definitely the best keg location In the city.",4
"Great service, manager Stephanie stopped by to ensure everything was as expected. Food was delicious as normal.",4
"When I made the reservation I mentioned that it was for our Anniversary and first time visit. Erin was our server. He never asked if this was a special occasion. He didn‚Äôt even ask if we wanted dessert before he brought the check. The food, filet mignon for my husband was excellent. The server did not ask me how I wanted my prime rib. Normally they will ask if you want the rarer side which I do not. Mine was more rare to my liking but it was good. Portions are good, server needs more training.",2
"The Service was very good 
Friendly and efficient. 
The restaurant was clean and comfortable. 
The food was tasty, not outstanding
Overall we enjoyed our experience.",3
"My ribeye steak was not AAA grade. The Keg had better. I come all the time for their steaks, and I would say 7 out of 10 times, the steaks are AAA grade. I couldn't finish my ribeye steak last night. It was that bad.",3
Always love the keg - consistently great value.,4
Or steaks were cooked incorrectly and we were not offered lobster summer menu,1
"Foos was delicious and cooked perfectly, our waiter Skyler was the best!",4
This was a birthday lunch and on all counts everything was outstanding. I highly recommend this location.,4
Our server Patrick was excellent! Food was great as always,4
"Hubby ordered medium well steak- sent it back because it was medium
I ordered a medium rare steak. 
1. came blue rare sent it back + mashed potatoes cold
2. re cooked steak - now in two pieces came out rare, sent it back
3. steak cooked more- zucchini was over cooked, outside of steak was very tough becuase it was cooked 3 x + fatty on one side.  Manager came and said sorry its on the house but really--- didn't enjoy steak becuase it was very hard to cut and chew because outside was cooked 3x and very seared. Plus I ate after my hubby was done eating.  Not a great date night/ pre theatre dinner experience.  Would think twice about returning. I would give 10 stars to the waitress though",2
Always great at this location. Servers are awesome.,4
Very disappointed with my prime rib and they didn‚Äôt have a spinach as a salad option,2
"Excellent service with delicious beef served up and no potato quite as delicious as the double
Baked!",4
"The steak and roast beef was great . Salad was bland and calamari was weak . Waitress was good , no singing happy birthday was also a disappointment .

Keg Leslie food is way better !!!",2
"Disappointing. Had to ask for silverware. Had to ask for steak knives. Overrated, overcooked. Server never cared to ask how things were. True bummer.",0
We had a guest with allergies and the Chef came over to make sure he has the right allergy detail.   Very impressive.,4
The Keg is consistently great. Food and service always top notch and great value.,4
Doors were locked at 11:30!,0
"My salmon was great. My boyfriend had the keg classic New York strip and substituted extra asparagus in replacement for the mushrooms and seasonal veggies. He received 5, stringy, thin, dry pieces and was very disappointed. Our service was great until he received his salad and then our waitress went Mia. She kept walking by us (while we left our empty vodka water and rye and coke glasses on the side of the table). She continuously bussed empty tables rather than taking our next drink orders or clearing our table. We didn‚Äôt say anything to management and didn‚Äôt want the waitress to feel uncomfortable, however, we love the keg (and frequent regularly) but this experience was unfortunately disappointing :(",3
The server did not offer more bread or Soda refills,4
"The service was extremely slow. The women‚Äôs bathroom was disgusting. There was paper towels and water all over the floor along with two stalls that were out of order. I did bring it to our our waitresses attention however, I‚Äôm not sure that she would‚Äôve shared it with the manager. Our dinner out was a total disappointment.",1
"Specifically asked for a nice table in the reservation request but was seated next to the til and washrooms.  Had to ask to be reseated.  Asked if they read the request beforehand and was met w a blank stare and ‚Äúummm‚Äù .
Waitress was nice but disappeared for extended periods and we would have to flag down other servers for refills.
I go to The Keg for the service and value but unfortunately tonight was an off night.",1
Always enjoy the lobster summer but I will say it‚Äôs more expensive now,3
"We were researching open table for the top steak house in Toronto. This one kept coming up in the top 5 with the most reasonable prices of the list so we gave it a shot. The filet was excellent and entire meal, drinks, and service were also top notch. We will definitely be back",4
Staff was great. Food was good. One of my favorite places to eat while in Canada,4
Excellent steaks all around.  Cooked exactly as ordered.,4
This is a great steakhouse central location and close to parking. Near theatre district and other venues. Near main business district also. The food is great! service very professional.,4
"Was sad that we were asked on this app if we were celebrating anything but it wasn‚Äôt acknowledged.  10th anniversary.  Small detail.  
Overall good.  Nice that it‚Äôs open for a lunch crowd, more Kegs should.",3
First time in town for a blue jays game and last minute reservation. Food was fast and tasty. Service was excellent. I‚Äôd return.. and recommend! Thank you for the evening.,4
"We went for a late lunch at 3, the restaurant was not busy. Our waitress came to take our drink orders. I placed mine, my son asked for a minute to look at the menu. It took 20 minutes for her to return with my drink and she didn‚Äôt ask if my son had decided on a drink, she just asked for our food order. My son ordered the calamari for an appetizer and the Keg burger for main course. He said neither had any flavour. I ordered the teriyaki sirloin and it was the worst steak I‚Äôve ever had at the Keg. There were multiple pieces I had to spit out as they were too tough to chew through, there was literally no flavour (I don‚Äôt think they put the teriyaki on it but there wasn‚Äôt even the taste of salt and pepper). Our waitress didn‚Äôt bring any of our food, we had to ask for refills, she wasn‚Äôt attentive, very poor service. I expect so much more from The Keg. This was a complete disappointment. I definitely won‚Äôt be returning to this location or recommending it to anyone.",0
"Our server was very nice and kind. Ordered the Filet mignon rare and my friends ordered entrees as well. Their steaks were nice and warm, whilst mine was literally cold. Server was very understanding and took it back to the kitchen to be reheated, but the manager came over and was very passive aggressive.

My friend‚Äôs plate also had a long hair on it and the manager said ‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm so sorry about that‚Ä¶ I mean you did still eat it all, but that‚Äôs fine.‚Äù, but there was still an ample amount of food left on the plate. A very back-handed thing to say to a guest.

The french onion soup had good flavour, but I found multiple chunks of raw onion skin in the soup which made it unpleasant to have to continuously pick out.

All-in-all, I wished the manager had handled both situations with a bit more patience and less attitude, but our server was great the whole time. I would come back to the keg, but not to this location.",2
"We had a great night, all the family enjoyed there meal. We will recommend for sure. Lobster (in season) is great",4
Service was well-timed and friendly. I love the relaxed feel of this place ‚Äì I definitely would return to try more dishes.,3
Service was outstanding.  I didn‚Äôt see a drink that I liked on the menu and our server asked the bartender to whip something up with my fave ingredients.  It was a delicious drink.,4
We waited a bit long after finishing everything for our check and then the machine to pay,3
The food was amazing and their choice of drinks was extensive. Loved the atmosphere and the wait staff was pleasant.,4
This keg is always great and good is consistent. Comfy place to take parents to dinner.,4
An excellent experience and parking across the street was a bonus. Great service and perfect steak.,4
"I order a black and tan beer, the barman didn‚Äôt take the time to separated the 2 different beer and was so much foam , was missing atleast 1/3 of anormal beer , I expect from keg bartander  more professionalism , my waitress was very good !",3
"I was extremely happy with my experience at this location. The service was great, the food was amazing, and most importantly they made sure to make the birthday we were celebrating extra special. These things helped us make great memories, so I cannot be grateful enough.",4
First time to this location and it was fantastic. Can‚Äôt wait to go back,4
The Keg is (almost) always consistent. This time was a bit off. The baked potato was in the oven or warming for too long and was mealy and unappetizing - and cold. Roast beef was cold too. Usually the food comes too quickly. This time it took forever and then I couldn‚Äôt find anyone to give me a steak knife so had to go to the reception desk. The server was‚Ä¶ too chirpy?  And‚Ä¶. She kept calling us ‚Äúmy love‚Äù. Didn‚Äôt like that at all. We will likely return and hope for a more typical dining experience at The Keg.,3
Very friendly staff.   Great menu choices and food was very tasty.  Only negative is dirty plates (salad) not removed before the entree arrived.  Just hate looking at a dirty plate.,4
"The service and the food were excellent 
Tables are a very good size and seating very comfortable",4
"The KEG is always consistent and reliable for quality of food, service, cleanliness and ambience.",4
"The Keg is one of my favorite places to eat, and have been to this location many since I work close by at the TMX.
Yesterday July 12h service was a bit disappointing.
First one wait staff came ask how we are  doing and never came back. 
Then another one came, and we  ordered two drinks, only one came. Usually the wait staff would suggest something that is not on the menu, but special of the day, nothing.
Overall it was not out best service.
I will come back to the Keg since I like the food etc and have had good wait staff in the past.",2
The Food was good but had to yell across the table to hear each other. Don't recommend for anyone with sensory issues or hearing problems unless you request a table in one of the quieter parts of the restaurant.,2
Wonderful as always. Might be my favourite Keg location.,4
"Like all restaurants these days, it's hard to hear converation.  Anything The Keg can do to dampen the noise levels would be appreciated.  Everything else was superb -- food, service, and quality of the setting.",4
"Service, food and ambience were great. The outdoor patio is beautiful and comfortable but the music was very loud.",4
My husband and I love the Keg. We've been going for our birthdays for years.,4
"Great venue, and the food is always reliably good.",3
Lovely food and service from Emma! Thanks for helping usove around avoiding the veyr hot sun!,4
"We ordered the lobster tail, steak and grilled shrimp dishes and the food was excellent.  The service was exceptional.  A wonderful experience for a date night and break from the kids!",4
"Our server was delightful, the food was good and the price reasonable. You can pay more (much more) for a steak in Toronto but you won't get much better in flavour than the Keg, which specializes in the basics - steak and potatoes - and does them very well.",3
"Unfortunately this place really disappointed us. We were so excited to finally get to go to a Keg. Everything was fine except the food. The fried calamari was dry, the barbque and chicken you could tell the food had been sitting all day. The BRUSSEL SPOUTS WERE AWFUL... Never had worst. Service was good, drinks were ok and the dessert was excellent.  Overall, we were very disappointed.  Very expensive and not worth it.",2
"Highly recommend. Excellent service, good food and plenty of choice.",4
We had dinner in this restaurant yesterday and it was excellent.  Both the food and the service were exceptional.  Thanks again to Ashley for serving us so well !,4
Very good service. Food was hot and delicious! Noise level was up there but the place was full so not unexpected.,4
Exceptional service. Very friendly and professional! Our meal was perfection as it always is at this location. We asked to sit in a quieter section and it was a much more enjoyable experience. It gets too loud when sitting in the main dining area. We sat at the front and will be sitting there moving forward. It was a more mature and lovely experience.,4
Very nice. Very busy after mlb game. Wait staff was over whelmed at first but all worked out.,4
"Food and service is always consistent.
Great place for a celebration",4
Excellent service with a fabulous meal,4
The food is very good but the service can surely be improved.,4
Great meal as always we always book here when traveling over from Scotland. Food is first class staff are great will always be a go to every time,4
Fabulous meal and service. Would definitely recommend,4
"Our waitress so super attentive, helpful and happy. The food was lovely and the back outdoor space was a great space to sit outside and eat in.",4
"Service was excellent. The cocktail shrimp were excellent. However, I did find the steak tough, although perfectly cooked. It may be because I am from Alberta that I am a bit of a beef snob :). Lovely locale and ambience. Thank you.",2
"Great spot, great staff. Food was fast and amazing",3
"Excellent filet, cooked as requested. The waitress was very amicable, checking 3 or 4 times during the meal that everything was fine.",4
"Amazing service and great food! Our server was sweet, kind and exceptional",4
"The Keg never fails to serve us great food and drinks at reasonable pricing.  The Keg, York Street, has a beautiful, hidden, quiet patio in the back.  Thanks Keg for another wonderful dinning experience!!!",4
"Visited two times this week - perfect service, great steaks and lobster - Andrea and Otmar Austria",4
excellent meal and service. drinks and wine selection is great,4
"As always, the steak and prime rib were stellar!  Excellent service and ambiance.",4
"Best Cosmo! Great escargot, so garlicky. Steak and shrimp done as ordered perfectly. Shrimp were huge. Steak tasted amazing. Highly recommend The Keg on York!",4
The best steak I have ever eaten! I will recommend to my friends!,4
"Excellent meal, very nicely brought to us by a friendly server.",3
We had a great experience. Excellent customer service when we had an issue with the way the steak was cooked.,4
The service at the Keg was amazing. Our server was attentive and friendly. The food was delicious and served pretty quickly. The drinks were cold and tasty on a hot summer day. Love this location.,4
"Whilst seated quickly service was slow, entrees took
Forever to come out and were cold.
Could have made loads more drinks sales if our server had been more attentive.
It felt like they were short staffed
Half way through the meal it became quite hot, and the volume of the music for the amount of people was far too loud.
The food was good but overall the experience fell far short of the usual standard at the keg.",1
"Service and food quality was excellent and super consistent, as usual.   To my mind, consistency is synonymous with The Keg.   It's a quality that's quite rare to find and so even more appreciated.

  Super reliable, consistent and very good quality, overall.   ‚Äì¬†Thank you to our server, Paul and to the team at The Keg!",4
The server was training and talked to much to the trainee he could have listened and watched and figured it out‚Ä¶.they didn‚Äôt check on our meals at all and my daughter's steak was to raw and didn‚Äôt eat it and they didn‚Äôt even notice it was untouched at the end of the meal They food was good and the front service staff were good. But drinks were slow to come ( also good) as well as the clearing at the end. Not overly impressed for the price,2
"Great value, kid friendly options. Attentive staff and mgmt.",4
Food was great. Service was great. Quality for the price is unbeatable.,4
"Awesome, great foood, big portions , kind service! Will be Back",4
Nice quiet dinner to start our vacation. Great service and the food is tasty and fresh.  Definitely a nice restaurant,4
"Food  is  great, service  too.  The 
 musica  was  too high  and  the  room too  dark  for  my taste.",4
Great for a business lunch meeting. Great service. Good food. Relaxing room.,4
"Wine (French SvB) was great,, steak (sirloin) cook to our liking and tender, my cauliflower mash was yummy - food was great, and with helpful calories. Our server was cheerful and excellent.",4
We were lucky to be seated at the back of the restaurant which is much quieter than the front as it has a fairly large bar area when you first walk in.  Our food and our server were both excellent.,4
The food is always outstanding! Service and ambiance ideal.,4
We had a great meal and service would definitely recommend,4
Our server at table 44 I think was not attentive and her service was very poor. The other servers around us were very helpful.,0
Delicious steak dinner with delicious sides  and appetizers. The Brie appetizer was delicious.  The filet with the blue cheese topping very delicious done exactly as I ordered it. Mashed potatoes  were also very good. Excellent service. Prices were very good for a very good dinner. Highly recommend.,4
"The food was great and so was the service. Steven was a great server. He was friendly, welcoming and attentive to my requests.",4
A good place for a business lunch. Service and food were excellent.,4
The keg food is always amazing and the waitress was super friendly and helpful. Lighting was too dim.,3
"As always the keg did not disappoint:) 
Everything about it was stellar ‚ô•Ô∏èüòä",4
"Although the restaurant was nearly full and there was a lot of conversations going on, the loud music continued to be played which made conversation difficult. It is bad enough that most restaurants have very poor acoustics which hinders conversation; playing overly lound thumping music is totally unnecessary on such occasions.",3
Great service and great food.  Wait for food was a bit long but worth it.  Waitress was awesome.,4
Best steak I‚Äôve had in a long time. The server was friendly and attentive.,4
"MY steak and fresh vegetables were very good. Doug, my server, was very friendly, welcoming and helpfuI.",4
"Choose your meal. Don't be greedy. It can be huge and expensive. Yet, the smaller portions are satisfying and moderately priced, inexpensive for the quality.",4
"Another wonderful experience at this Keg location. I was hoping for the complimentary sparkling white wine upon entry as previous times but learned that only is offered once they are busier with people waiting for their tables. Fair enough.

Everything was perfect. From the front of house staff upon entry and our server Skyler, it could not have been any better. Even the other staff who brought some of our dishes were personable and kind.

The escargot and baked garlic shrimp were delicious as we have remembered on previous occasions.

My wife had the 8oz Top sirloin and I had the 12oz Baseball Top Sirloin Classic because at home, I never seem to be able to get a thick cut from the grocery store.  This time I had it medium which was perfect and tender. Last time I had it medium rare and it was difficult to cut and chew due it its level of doneness in the centre but I did not have that issue this time.   The side vegetables were cooked to perfection remaining some of it‚Äôs crunch and the double baked potato, yum.

Really enjoy their gin basil lemonade cocktail again. Not sweet as it‚Äôs made from real lemon juice and not a sweetened lemonade. Fresh basil of course.

Enjoyed their bottle of rose offering as well.

As we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, the Billy Miners Pie was complimentary. If you have never had it before, it‚Äôs huge and is really a flavourful (I think maybe a hazelnut caramel flavour but don‚Äôt quote me on that) ice cream pie.  It was presented by who I believe is the manager who I spoke briefly to upon entering this excellently run Keg.

Very highly recommend this restaurant due to all the personnel there and the wonderfully prepared foods.   The ambiance is very nice as well.",4
Great food and service at good value. This is our go-to place for night out with friends.,4
"The service was excellent!  However, my Teriyaki sirloin was tough as shoe leather. My husband‚Äôs filet was very good.",3
Great service by the team.  A special shout out to Nikki and Matthew.,4
"Me and my husband went to dine here shortly after after arriving in Toronto. It was my birthday and I couldn't have picked a better venue. The food was excellent, my steak was cooked to perfection. The service was also very good, we weren't waiting for too long at all. A great way to spend my birthday and a good start to our Toronto adventure.",4
You can always count on good food at every location.,4
"I love the Keg!!

We need one in the UK!
 
Great steaks, great customer service, nice atmosphere",4
Always a great meal at the Keg. Perfect catch-up for our team.,4
"Very good experience. Thanks
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",4
Our night out at the Keg was great. We arrived early and they brought us in before our reservation time. The steaks were cooked to perfection. The service was impeccable. We were never without anything and it was quick. We highly recommend.,4
We enjoyed an early dinner after matinee theatre performance. The restaurant filled up and was pretty much full for dinner. Food well cooked as we have had before. Service friendly but seemed a bit short staffed for servers for such a busy evening. Still great time overall.,3
"My guest had a top sirloin that was very tough. The manager did graciously take it off our bill. The service was very good, ambience was great. I would certainly return again.",4
"Love the Keg 
Please don‚Äôt remove the Nachos, Hoisin Cauliflower and Baked Brie off the menu 
Thx",4
"Mostly everything was perfect. The wrong beer was brought, the server forgot to bring the bread, and forgot to put bacon on the caesar salad; he brought bacon in separate little dishes and we were charged $4 extra for the bacon. Other than that, always love the Keg, so these were minor disappointments.",4
"I was shocked that even though I made the reservation three weeks in advance I still had to wait 20 minutes for my table. While people who just walked in got a table while we had to wait.
The other issue was sitting by the serving station where staff kept tripping and dropping/breaking dishes because there was no way to see if someone was coming or going in the space a simple dome mirror on the ceiling would have fixed that and then I could have relaxed and enjoyed my dinner instead of telling the staff to watch out as someone was there. i am sure that the dome mirror would cost less then the broken dishes and glasses.",3
Great food and service. Just hard to find food under $50 a plate.,3
"Ashley was amazing, friendly, helpful, knowledgeable about the menu. Based on her service alone, I‚Äôll be stopping by this Keg location when I‚Äôm in Toronto next.",4
This is definitely my go to restaurant for steak and a nice night out. Highly recommend.,4
"Loved our waiter Chris yesterday. He was quick, professional and checked in on us often but not enough where it was annoying. Can't recommend him enough. Thanks Chris.",4
"From walking through the door, staff were very friendly, and couldn't do enough for you. Food was amazing, decent size steaks.",4
"Our server was great!  She was friendly, professional.  Definitely made a great impression.",4
Excellent wait staff. Good price for servings portion.    The Prime Steak was cooked perfectly.  The sides were bland but there.,3
Great food.  Amazing rack of lamb.  Wonderful server ‚ÄúHeather‚Äù.  Ambiance was superb.,4
John was a amazing server that looked after our every need and even gave me a free birthday cake! I highly recommend you celebrating your birthday here and ask for John!,4
"Love the Keg, always consistent. It was an early Sunday dinner, place wasn't overly busy.",4
"Steak was slightly burned , service was good, prefers other kegs",3
Always love a trip to the keg. The food is reliable and reasonable priced. The keg on york is the best location in the city in my opinion. Beautiful patio.,4
Perfect diner on this wonderful place downtown. recommend the outside terrasse,4
The meal delivered to our table was not what we ordered. My wife and I actually did not eat the meat that came to our table. The steaks were not cooked to what we ordered. The Manager was very accommodating and removed the meal charge.,2
Our server Scyuler was fantastic! Friendly and efficient! Would recommend this restaurant to everyone!4,4
The Keg is truly classic on all levels. Has a lovely evening with my son .,4
The top sirloin was horrible! It was cooked medium rare but so difficult and rough to chew! Steak quality was very very bad!,2
The patio staff were very attentive and kept checking on us which was appreciated. The service was quick and the food was top notch. They even offered alternative seating when the heater near our seats on the patio was not working.,3
Everyone had an excellent meal and service! Very happy.,4
Delicious food and exceptional service. Ambience and outdoor patio is a nice retreat from the downtown hustle and bustle.,4
Received excellent service from Edina. Steaks were prepared to order and our after dinner drinks were complimentary as they found coffee grounds in my espresso. That‚Äôs what I call ‚Äúlooking after your customers‚Äù. Received an apology from the manager also. Well done Keg! Will definitely return to this one.,3
"Nice atmosphere, lighting is perfect. Food and service were excellent . We were able too have a nice conversation. 2 sisters and daughters!",4
"My son and I chose to visit the York St location to celebrate his birthday. I made a reservation online and our table was ready when we arrived! Our dinner was perfect! The service we recieved was amazing. It was an unexpected treat when a generous slice of ice cream cake arrived, wonderfully presented and with a candle, for my son.  
An enjoyable experience and we will return!",4
"Husband and  I are regular customers of the Keg. This was by far our best Keg experience. Food was A+.  However, the main complaint regarding this location is that it would be great if management would not permit homeless people to lay on the sidewalk right outside your main doors entrance. It was very off putting to see a man camped out immediately outside the front door of the Keg.",4
"We had the classic prime rib and the filet mignon, they come with sides. The mushrooms were to die for! Both were cooked medium rare and they were perfect! The specialty dessert, a mocha ice cream pie, was a perfect way to end the night!",4
"Nice place and tasty steaks here. I‚Äôd like it!
There only one thing was confusing 
Me and my wife ordered 2 steaks but one was 7oz and another one was 10oz but both was the same size, so take small one it will be cheaper)",4
"Lobster bisque was sour. Searched for any evidence of lobster, could not find even a small piece.  Chicken was not fresh and very chewy.  My error for ordering chicken at a steak house I guess.  We mentioned it was a birthday celebration on my reservation which was not acknowledged in any way which seems to be a common oversight via other reviews.  If it is a special occasion, communicate this another way other than noting it on your reservation.",3
"I usually go to Hy‚Äôs but tried the keg today instead.  The steak at the keg was far superior to Hy‚Äôs in my opinion. Was cooked to perfection, very thick and juicy. It will be my go to spot going forward.",4
"Great food, but didn‚Äôt have the wine we ordered off the menu.",3
A bit too noisy for my taste. Difficult to hear my partner.,2
Music is too loud! Not all diners want to eat at a disco...,3
Always a safe and very good choice for a good steak!,4
Emma was a fantastic server and as always the food was consistent and delicious,4
My colleague‚Äôs and I had a quick lunch and the service is always consistent at the Keg.,4
The team at this location is stellar! I have food allergies and they were so careful with me. I have never had so much care and attention from staff! The food had an issue and they made it right and even took it off the bill when they absolutely didn‚Äôt have to! I would recommend this location and service again and again!!! Please give them all raises!,4
"I have been to the Keg many times and this experience was nothing special. Service was ok, food was ok‚Ä¶nothing really outstanding about it at all. I don‚Äôt believe I will visit this York Street Keg again.",3
Food was great - server was really busy with a much larger group which resulted in our service being slow and an appetizer not being served.,3
Had theatre tickets for 7 o‚Äôclock 15 minutes away by cab and were seated 15 minutes late so a little tight for time but otherwise everything good.,3
"the keg is consistently great, can't say I've ever had a bad meal there",4
Are waiter/waitress was great. Food was great as usual. Not much to say; I will say that some of the other staff came off as a little smarmy. They were trying to be nice but it just wasn‚Äôt genuine. Please take this as feedback but not a complaint.   Everyone was super nice. Just wanted to letting the staff know they don‚Äôt need to put on airs. They are already nice!,4
"Food was great, service was excellent. Prices not bad for today‚Äôs world.",4
"Going to the keg isn‚Äôt what it used to be.

Ordered a keg sized Caesar initially and said I‚Äôm going keep the wine menu because I‚Äôd like to order some and have picked it out yet. I don‚Äôt think they put any alcohol in the Caesar. Was terrible.

Someone other than our server brought our food and usually they check in on you shortly after they bring the food to make sure your steak was cooked to your liking and everything tastes good. No one ever checked on us. Didn‚Äôt see the waiter again until I‚Äôm finishing my food, and he sees the wine menu left open and asked if I like to order wine. The meal is over! Why would I order it now? He could see I was annoyed and tried to make it better with Billy Miner pie.

My dining companion just had a Pepsi and was never offered a refill.

Steak was pretty good but mashed potatoes were lukewarm at best. Ôøº",1
"We had a great meal, with great service from Dane. The Keg is consistently good, and this was no exception.",4
"Staff are very prompt we're shown to our booth as soon as we arrived.  Our server was very helpful and knowledgeable as we chose our meat.  Steaks were done to perfection!
Overall a very enjoyable experience.",4
"Just great steaks, reasonably priced, and excellent service.",4
"Great Server & Hostess
Food is always very good.
Will come again.",4
"Very good! Server was very pleasant amd
Food was excellent",4
"Beautiful location, delicious food. My waitress was very friendly and attentive. I'd definitely return to this location",3
"We love The Keg and go fairly often. We brought our kids this time (9 and 5) and the service was great. The kids love the kids menu options; prime rib was excellent as usual. I feel like we can always count on consistently good quality food and service. Only odd thing this time around was that the kids ice cream for dessert was a two teaspoon serving (not an exaggeration). I think it is possible they ran out of ice cream... Anyway, we laughed it off because it isn't a big deal, but hopefully that isn't the new normal as dessert is a treat for them so they were a little disappointed this time.",3
"Typically Keg. Attentive service from all involved, waiter, table service and roving managment. Only complaint was noise level, hard to have a conversation with tablemates over thumping music.",3
Miguel was an exceptional server! He was friendly and attentive. The food and drinks were perfect!,4
This was a 16th birthday dinner out before attending the Opera for my son .,4
"From start to finish we had a fantastic experience, the starts mains and deserts where superb, the drinks where 1st class
The service was 2nd to none
As it was my 50th birthday the management provided me with a free out of this world desert
Well done üëè üëèüëèüëè the Keg",4
Outstanding experience. Ample choices and great food and superb friendly service. Ribeye is a must! The salmon made with maple butter and pistachios was a standout .. kudos for a steak house! Wine choice was great.. merlots from Niagara area were fantastic.,4
"We love the keg! Best Restaurants ever, we go for every occasion",4
I found that the quality of the food (especially the steak) has declined in the last couple of visits that I have had at The Keg.  Based on what you are paying for a steak dinner the meal was disappointing.,2
"Great place, delicious food, great service, will be back soon for sure!",4
It was a cozy evening spent enjoying a delicious steak meal with family. The service and food were excellent.,4
"You can never go wrong with the Keg; food is always top notch, fresh and tasty. Service was impeccable, we had a wonderful time.",4
"This was a business lunch with two colleagues.  Service and food were excellent.  The table shared some sizzling shrimps for the appetizer, while the mains were divided between the steak sandwich with fries, 10 oz NY striploin with side Caesar, and 6 oz NY striploin with fries.  All were cooked to order and delicious.  No one had dessert.

The Keg is consistently good and I am always pleased to dine there, or to recommend it to friends and colleagues.",4
"The Keg never disappoints.  Good food, great service and wonderful ambience.",3
"Service was very attentive and friendly. The restaurant was busy the night of a Leaf playoff game, but we were served our meal promptly. Everything was delicious!",4
"The usual reliable good food, service and atmosphere.  All he reasons we continue to come back.",4
It was amazing thank you for having my friends an I,4
"Greetings. I was put next to a table with a couple, one small child and a baby. Not exactly what I was expecting. Best regards,",2
"Amazing restaurant 
Always good and careful about allergies",4
Our server was friendly and was sure to get all of our orders correct.  Food was very tasty.,3
"Excellent steaks, cooked to perfection. Great  fresh salads. Service professional and pleasant.
Very large resto but we were seated in a small section which was intimate and friendly. 

Only downside was very poor coffee.  

Definitely need to reserve a table.",4
"The food was amazing, our server got very busy and we waited to long to get our final bill. The problem we had is with the pot lights shinning in your face while you are at the table.  Also the bench seats don‚Äôt work for short people, we sat at a table for 2 and one seat was a bench, my wife was not able to sit at the bench because she was too low at the table. Then we switched seats and now she has the pot light shinning in her face. My suggestion, remodel the restaurant remove bench seats and change to indirect lighting.",4
"Over all, it was a pleasant experience. Though we showed up right at our reservation time which was 5pm and mentioned to our server that we were pressed for time, it took her a long time to take our orders, and by the time the food came out it was already 615-20 ish. Given that we didn't even order appetizer to make sure we were on schedule, it was bit surprising. And even then there was some mix up with orders, it felt very unorganized and we were very close to missing a show. Food was delicious but it really would have been nice to celebrate birthday in slightly less stressful way.",2
"Not a positive experience. Made a reservation at 730 and asked for a quiet booth. Was originally seated on a bench seat with tables on either side of us. Requested a change for a booth. We were then moved to a seat BEHIND the bar with a 1/2 wall separating us from the noise. Brilliant. Needless to say we had to yell to each other sitting 2 feet away for the rest of the night. Our server arrived and was about as blah as one could be. Not enthusiasm, personality or anything resembling wanting to make this a pleasant experience. We were constantly waiting for her return to refill drinks, check on status of our orders, quality of the food, advance the next part of the dinner. So thankfully our steaks were excellent. 2 New York 12 ounce cooked perfectly. The billy miner pie was a good finish. The service from start to finish was subpar and why would you seat us behind an open bar area??? We won't be back and I'd recommend going elsewhere for a date night.",2
Awesome dinner!!! Steak was perfect!!!! Cooked to perfection and the service was perfect!,4
the food was excellent as usual and the service was very good.,4
Amazing. Looks so nice compared to other locations. I will be back soon.,4
"I love the Keg normally. This was the first time to this location. 
Food was cold and not cooked to my liking. Waitress wasn‚Äôt very attentive to us or our needs. Usually when entering the Keg, you‚Äôre asked if you are celebrating anything. We were not asked and we WERE celebrating a birthday. So disappointed",2
"Both customers had steak.  One was cook perfect.  The prime rib steak was not seared, therefore, it was bland. 

Also the table we had was in a very poor location.  The outside was directly in the path of the stairs and close to people going back and forth thereby bumping into customer‚Äôs chair.",2
"The bread was good - they should cut it instead of simply scoring the top esp when there are 4 ppl sharing it's awkward for everyone to grab a piece.    The calimari was super bland, the lobster bisque was way too salty, the shrimp and crab cakes were good.   Need to up the game on non steak offerings, I went here for a work lunch (not my choice) and I don't like steak, and always select seafood.    It was nothing to write home about, you expect a steak establishment to have seafood options that are  decent in comparison to the steak - I don't think this was the case.",2
"Server was very friendly,  excellent service. Price is a bit high!!",4
"The music being piped through the restaurant was to loud causing the patrons to speak loud to be able to hear each other over the music. Music was also not conducive to a date, romantic or quiet evening.

Tables in some areas were also extremely close to each other you felt you were having dinner with strangers. 

Food was great - service wonderful!",2
Large downtown restaurant with terrific staff and great food.,4
"Excellent as always, great steak and lobster.  All very reasonable priced.  Would definitely recommend The Keg",4
The food was cold even though it came out quickly? And our server forgot our mushroom order and then took 15 minutes to get the bill to us? We had to get the hostess to find our waitress and my then my kid (there was just two of us) was dragging me out be door :( not what I was used to for a Keg. Hopefully a one time thing.,2
"wonderful, meal and service. Food is always consistent from location to location.",4
I am a fan of The Keg but had never been to this location. I love the more modern feel. Food and drinks were superb and it is hard to find a delicious peppercorn crusted these days and server offered it on a 6 oz sirloin as opposed to the normal 12 oz NY striploin which is a little large for me. Service was helpful and friendly. A great experience.,4
Always reliable for a great night out. The watermelon cosmo is really good. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive.,4
Food amazing. Don't forget the Billy Miner for desaert,4
We had a great time at the Keg! The atmosphere was great and our water was great.  The food is always good. And last night did not disappoint,4
"Great value at good price and great service, would recommend to anyone",4
Only issue we experienced is that gift cards were not able to be processed. Everyone was very polite however about the circumstances. Overall good night and our server was very courteous.,3
Great experience as always at this location of the Keg.,4
Great food and service. We arrived early and were accommodated quickly.,4
Way too loud initially but then as patrons left a normal conversation could resume. Our server was OUTSTANDING!  And the food was incredible. Overall a very positive experience.,4
"consistent excellence in service and food quality

always a great experience",4
The hostess was a bit abrupt with us when we arrived early but from that point the service was great and we left happy. We will return.,4
Excellent service and friendly smiles from all staff. We felt like honoured customers,4
Had a great dinner on our trip to Toronto!   Great service excellent food!  Definitely recommend!,4
Any steak is done well. Recommend all the Keg classics.,3
"We had great service, delicious food, great recommendations and fast service, will be back, thanks",4
"Went there for birthday celebration. We specified that but nothing recognized.
First thing, the escargot used to be nice in garlic butter but I don‚Äôt know what the flavorful was but they were awful.
I ordered filet mignon. I got a pepper steak which they assured me was a filet! It was so hot. There was so much pepper my tongue was burning. By the time they had made a new, correct one, my 2 sons had finished their meals. 
The manager apologized but not so much as a beverage offered for all the trouble.
Spending nearly $300 with tax and tip for 3 people, with just 2 alcoholic drinks and being so disappointed is pretty bad on my birthday.
Will definitely not return to the Keg, very disappointing!!!!!",1
"It took 15 minutes for us to be greeted by a wait staff once we were seated. However once she did come over she was lovely. We were seated in a spot that backed the bar and was sectioned off by glass. VERY noisy. Food was good but outside of filet mignon was tough. Disappointed there were no non-alcoholic wine options. Apps and main course was good, dessert was extremely disappointing. Apple crumble was almost sour? Very off tasting.",2
Service was prompt and professional. Food was well prepared and as ordered. Will most certainly revisit.,4
Always fantastic - I love this location and have been here virtually every time I visit Toronto.,4
We appreciated the good service and delicious food! Thank you for being accommodating and caring about allergies.,4
"The food was as good as we expected, the server was excellent, courteous, and quick.",4
Bread was cold so a bit hard to chew the crust. Noise was loud had a hard time conversing with  my friend,4
Our server was wonderful! She gave us amazing recommendations which tasted fantastic and helped me around my dairy sensitivity. The energy was calm which made the environment pleasant.,4
Service was great and the food met expectations.  Always a good meal at the Keg,4
"The service at this Keg location was great! We were greeted warmly when we arrived, and thanked for visiting as we left.  Our server was attentive, engaging and responsive.  Food was absolutely delicious.",4
"Final meal in Toronto for our holiday visit, food and service were fantastic and it gave us a great end to our visit. I‚Äôm gluten free as well and the staff knew there stuff .",4
"Great meal
Great service
Great atmosphere 
Great value",4
"Went to York St Keg before the leafs game Saturday night and it was great at usual, but our server Cassie really elevated our experience that night with such amazing service. We would go back just for her!",4
"Overall we enjoyed dinner, table was ready when we arrived, appetizers were great, calamari, crab cakes, stuffed mushrooms. Our sirloin steaks were a bit tough to cut, med rare, completely red inside, but stll delicious. The vegetable to accompany was out at 5:30 p.m. so we had to substitute.",3
"Best quality meats, great service, great selection of wines and delicious desserts .",4
"Great food, fan atmosphere and great service, really enjoyed our evening",4
Our waiter Ted was excellent! Went above and beyond accommodating all our requests.,3
Food was amazing. All staff were great and friendly. Very energetic. Great experience overall. Definitely worth going back,4
"Excellent experience, as usual. Anytime we are in a city with a Keg location, we make a point of going. The food and service never disappoint.",4
Reunion at,4
good reliable food.  expensive but still value.  a bit noisy. service was excellent,3
"Very noisy behind the bar. Moved to longe and it was better but still loud. Fillets were good, cooked exactly as asked. Hard to hear waitress though, even in lounge.",2
The Keg is always very careful when you need gluten free meals. Every single time they‚Äôve taken great care and I‚Äôve had no issues eating there.,4
"My husband was looking for a great steak. The food was so good and service was also great. The waitress took the time to explain the types of steak they prepare. Overall, it was a great experience.",4
"Good food, good service, pretty consistent but not a wow venue",2
"Delicious meal, Vanessa made it fabulous! Like the new condensed menu. Birthday ice cream cake very much appreciated!",4
"Food is always reliable and meets all expectations. Unfortunately had the worst experience in service ever at a Keg ‚Ä¶ the time between each visit from our server was very long. Had us waiting to order a drink, then meal, then dessert and clearly didn‚Äôt want us to leave cause we had to wait so long for the cheque. Hopefully it‚Äôs a one off but wasn‚Äôt impressed",2
It was awesome our server was great! It was a nice to get together and enjoy dinner,4
Overall it was a great experience. We will definitely going back.,4
I took my wife here for her birthday.  A great dinner and vibe at the Keg.,3
We had a great server who was very attentive. Our reservation was seated on time and we were not rushed.,4
"Food was great as was our server John
There was a large group next to us so a little louder than usual
A little more space between tables would be nice
A little more pricey too",3
"Tr√®s bonne viande, onctueuse et go√ªteuse. Je recommande...",4
Overall was good meal and service.  Only complaint would be the very undercooked long beans as part of the vegetable portion.  They were not good and neither of us ate them.,3
"We had a dinner at Keg as a staff appreciation dinner. We all enjoyed the meal, and I, personally, couldn‚Äôt get enough how good the 18.oz prime rib was!!

Thank you. 

We will come back!",4
Ryan (our server) was phenomenal! He was super attentive and accommodating towards all our needs.,3
"The staff were extremely friendly, helpful, and took very good care of us.",4
The food was great as usual. However the noise factor is through the roof.,4
Always pleased with the Keg. It's a family favorite.,4
"Always a positive experience.  Friendly, professional staff.  Excellent menu and delicious food cooked to perfection.  Great venue for a quick business lunch.",4
"Terrible experience at The Keg York Street. Steak was cooked like a hockey puck despite asking for medium rare. Server took so long to come back and check that it was too late to get a replacement as the rest of my party were finished their meals.
Of course they took care of my meal but not the best fix, customers don‚Äôt dine there looking for a free meal that they couldn‚Äôt eat. :-)",2
"I ordered a 10 oz. Prime Rib (medium) more than a third of it was fat and gristle: I did not complain because my daughter was treating me to a meal at my choice of restaurant (before we went to the Theatre).

She was very satisfied with her meal.",3
"An excellent pre-show meal with great food and an amazing server, would recommend this to anyone who asks.",4
Excellent service and as always the food was great.,4
"Had a great tasting steak that didn't cost me my first born child. My waitress was friendly and the manager spoke to my dinner companion specifically about their allergies, which was appreciated. Ambiance was good too with solid music and a dimly lit atmosphere but still well lit enough to easily read the menu and see your companions.",4
Aaron B was the most amazing sever. Only thing our table was near the stairs so lots of traffic.,4
"Great service, excellent food!!!! Love the York street location. Nice ambiance.",4
This is a great Keg for a downtown lunch. Very thing was fantastic.,4
"A decent place for business luncheon, especially now there are fewer nice restaurants opening for lunch in downtown core.",3
Excellent food and service as always - big difference between quiet table and louder bar area.,4
"Very attentive service.  My dining partner and I have food allergies, which were very promptly and professionally looked after.  Very few, if any, other restaurants in Toronto take dietary restrictions as seriously as does The Keg.",4
We sat waiting for a server for far too long in between visits.,2
"Consistently excellent food and attentive service. The only thing I wish were different is the noise level. The ceilings are not particularly high, so it can get pretty loud.",4
Forgot the name of our waiter but she was amazing !,4
"Awesome service, super attentive with allergies issue, was handled as it should!! Really recommend!!",4
Enjoyable food and great service. Could have been less noisy,3
Had the best experience here with my wife to celebrate her promotion. Highly suggest this location over all others.,4
It was as expected. We enjoyed ourselves and will definitely be back,4
Everything was great except for a particularly loud table near us.  Wish they had asked for a private room.  It infringed on at least 6-8 tables nearby,4
"Nous √©tions 2 adultes avec notre adolescente de 16 ans. Un premier serveur est venu nous porter les menus sans plus. Lorsqu‚Äôil est revenu une autre serveuse est arriv√©e et c‚Äô√©tait un peu la confusion‚Ä¶elle travaillait dans une autre section. 10-15 minutes plus tard elle est revenue avec de l‚Äôeau et est repartie. Elle est revenue une dizaine de minutes plus tard et on lui a demand√© si on pouvait commander quelque chose √† boire, nous √©tions attabl√©s depuis au moins 25 minutes. On a donc commander les drinks et la nourriture en m√™me temps. Les drinks sont arriv√©s, le gin tonic √©tait flat et ma Sandro a √©tait dilu√©e et j‚Äôavais pas de fruits dedans. Mon mari et ma filles ont re√ßu leur entr√©e mais pas moi. Comme la serveuse ne revenait pas j‚Äôai pens√© qu‚Äôelle l‚Äôavait oubli√©. La serveuse est arriv√©e avec les 2 plats principaux mais pas d‚Äôassiette vide pour que je puisses partager mon repas avec ma fille malgr√© que je l‚Äôavais pr√©cis√© lorsque j‚Äôai pass√© ma commande.  La serveuse est revenue avec l‚Äôassiette vide et mon entr√©e‚Ä¶..j‚Äôai dit √† la serveuse qu‚Äôil √©tait trop tard pour l‚Äôentr√©e puisque mon repas principal √©tait arriv√© et que voulais manger mon steak chaud. Elle m‚Äôa regard√© avec un air b√™te et  m‚Äôa redemand√© si je voulais mon entr√©e et j‚Äôai dit que non. Elle est reparti f√¢ch√© avec mon entr√©e. Nous avions presque termin√© notre repas lorsqu‚Äôelle est revenue nous voir (toujours avec l‚Äôair b√™te) pour nous demander si tout √©tait correcte‚Ä¶.une chance que la cuisson des steak √©tait parfaite car sinon on aurait attendu longtemps. Elle est venue enlever nos assiettes et a demand√© √† mon mari pour la facture. J‚Äôai pay√© la facture et j‚Äôai quand m√™me laiss√© 18% de pourboire malgr√© le mauvais service. Elle m‚Äôa demand√© b√™tement si je voulais la copie et est reparti sans dire merci ou bonne soir√©e.  Je ne sais pas si c‚Äôest parce que nous √©tions des francophones, parfaitement bilingue, que avons √©t√© trait√© de la sorte mais ce fut un experience tr√®s d√©sagr√©able.",1
"While the food was up to expectations, the service was not. We had ordered (we thought) from the ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù menu but our server took it as a la carte. As a result, we did not get our salads and had to ask for some of the side dishes. The ambience was not good; far too noisy.",2
"The food was just as we expected and had experienced before, always delicious. What made our visit the best was our server. I regret not getting her  name or keeping our receipt, but we were there at 1pm Fri 17th March, in case you cannot trace the reservation back. Sherri is my  name and we sat on the York street side of the restaurant. She was friendly, polite, just as engaging as you would want, and let us take our time. This was important to us because this was our first dining experience since covid hit, and with my sister and brother in law so we had alot of catching up to do. Not being rushed was extremely valuable to us.",4
"The food was great the service was great. The choice of music was bad and it was to loud, it gave me a headache.  
We were celebrating our anniversary and got no recognition from the restaurant.",2
Dane was super and so was the food. I haven‚Äôt been in decades and was really surprised by the quality and value. Thank you!,4
Sandy our server was excellent. Very welcoming and fast with our requests. Food was up to your usual standards. A nice overall experience!,4
"Delicious food, great service. We loved everything we ordered, and there were things we wished we could have tried, but the portions are HUGE and we ran out of room.",4
"Our server Patrick was great! No rushing us, perfect with our orders. Took note of me being Celiac and the manager came out to assure me that my meal would be carefully looked after. A great start for our evening at the theatre!",4
Our server was amazing!!!!  The food was also excellent but again our server was amazing,4
Everything was perfect other than the fire trucks coming over during our meal..! The waitress and manager were amazing and kept is updated on the situation..! It was resolved quickly and we finished our meal ..! Thanks again..!,4
"They sat us at the worst table. It was like a cubby hole, very dark too, and not the romantic kind. As we sipped our drinks a fire alarm started blasting every few seconds for almost 15 minutes. We were just about to leave as it stopped. Then the food came she got the fillet and I got the prime rib. Neither was anything special, and the filet was the wrong temperature. Overall it was a terrible experience and we will never go back!",1
"As always, we have enjoyed the dinner!  The service was good, thank you!  Two things to improve:  my steak was well done instead of medium well (very dry) and cappuccino did not look/taste as it should be (no foam, too much milk).  Thank you",3
"The waiter was fantastic, food was great especially the billy miner pie",4
"Perfect dinner with great friends to celebrate a birthday. The food was consistently excellent as always as were the cocktails and our service by Kristin was superb.
Definitely will be back soon!",4
It's a keg. Pretty good food for a decent price. .,3
"Excellent service and food as always. It‚Äôs a busier location, so I recommend a reservation!",4
The service was at a high level and the food was outstanding in terms of quantity and quality. We were there for an early dinner which included their cocktail hour. I think one ounce of alcohol for their special cocktails was on the modest side. I remember more Keg size cocktails that were epic!,3
"I always love dining at the Keg. I had the mushroom rice with my dinner this time and it wasn't my favourite (rice was too al dente and it didn't have a lot of flavour), so will stick to the potato options when I have a full dinner.",4
"Great meal, great service and liked the atmosphere",4
When we paid the option for tip was minimum 18% I should have the option of how much tip I want to give our server was very good,3
"Unfortunately the restaurant was overwhelmed with lunch rush and we were on the tail end. It happens , but had limited time and was with clients . Food was good",2
The service was amazing as was the food!  Overall great experience!  It did get a little loud at peak hours but nothing to takeaway from an overall very positive experience.,4
"Thank You for an overall very pleasant experience while dining with some dear friends. 
Our only quite bothersome concern was the fact that we apparently needed to fold up our rather bulky and heavy winter coats and store them on the booth seats next to us therefore leaving inadequate seating for four adults. However, as always The Keg was otherwise excellent.",3
"We thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience at The Keg, York St. Toronto. Big thank you to our server Paul.",4
"Not all tables were filled, but it took too long to get our food out (over 45min). We were late for meetings.",2
"I can never say enough great things about the Keg on York Street!!  Food is always excellent, but it's really (for me) about the staff.  When you walk in the door you are greeted by the most friendly hosts (shout out especially to Gem, but I adore everyone!).  I always sit at the bar and the servers are wonderful - especially Kaley and Andra.  The busboys are very friendly as well - shout out especially to Ricky, Matt and Noah.  It is a comfortable place to visit for lunch and I always look forward to seeing the people that work there that I can now call my friends.  Last shout out to Andrea!!!",4
"Great job and great food, service was outstanding as the waitress was very friendly and smiling",3
"Everything was great except our table felt a bit crowded for the size of our party. Thank you for always taking food allergies so seriously, it is greatly appreciated.
On a side note:
Please change the soap in the bathroom, it smells terrible.",3
Salad and bread came quickly.  Main course took a while.  It was very busy though.  A good experience overall.,3
"The Keg was great, the staff were super friendly and polite, the food was amazingly delicious, it was our anniversary and we got complimentary dessert on the house üòç we loved the food and of course the dessert, 100% recommended üëåüèº Thank you Keg for made our night great ü•Çüçæ",4
The staff were very polite and professional. There was no wait even though we were early. Meal was cooked the way it was ordered. Waitress was very good and professional. Made for a pleasant meal and night.,4
"Opted for Bar Seating........Organized confusion, as we were handled by four different Servers throughout our dining experience; took three attempts to get a Wine List.
Appetizers were good (Ahi Tuna and the Baked Brie)
Entr√©es were hit & miss.
My Client ordered the Pistachio crusted Salmon & was pleased with the choice.
I ordered the Peppercorn NY Steak (Bad choice); poor cut, as the Steak was tough & riddled with fat (Not just Marbling).
NOTE: They did deduct the Steak from the Bill. However, the Manager remained in
             hiding & wouldn't come out to discuss the issue.
             We have  supported this Venue (Since its inception) & spent $$$$ 
            throughout the COVID Lockdown.

Don't sacrifice 'Quality' in an attempt to hold the line on pricing !",3
"Food is always amazing at the Keg, it truly maintains its standards from location to location. Service was ok, nothing great. Kinda felt forgotten about near the end of the meal. Would be back again for food!",3
"Good food good service good vibes
Fillet mignon perfect",4
"Tres bon service ! Soucie de la satisfaction du client! Fais 2 fois que j‚Äôy vais et les 2 fois j‚Äôai ador√©!
Je vais revenir sais sur!",4
"Excellente nourriture et excellent service ! 
Le steak cuit parfaitement selon nos demain et assaisonnent de la viande tr√®s √©quilibr√©. 
Je recommence !",4
We had the classic 7oz tenderloin meals.  The mixed greens salad was tasty and fresh.  Meat was cooked to perfection.  The service was great.  Lighting was a bit dim where we were seated but that's my only complaint.,3
"Perfect place for our anniversary
Food was amazing. Lighting was a little lackluster, but my girl made up for it.",4
There was a hair on a bun.   I did not tell anyone because I did not want to upset anyone I was with.,1
All good - fair prices.  Great service,3
Staff was very attentive and friendly. Service and food was exceptional,3
The service was great. Just wish there was somewhere to put our coats! It felt crapmed in the booth with our coats.,4
"You didn't get outstanding, because there's always room for improvement",3
"Best Steak House value for the money in Toronto, and lots of other options for other members of the group.. Great food and warm, relaxing surroundings.",3
Great steak in a wonderful atmosphere.,4
"10/10 at the keg. Menu could be more inclusive for someone joining a group for a business meal. It‚Äôs a steakhouse, so only a couple vegetarian options.",4
Always a good time and good food.   Great location and great staff.,4
"Our server, from BC LPN was excellent. She went above and beyond with her service. The manager brought my daughter a surprise birthday Billy Miner pie which was lovely.
Reccomend this restaurant!! Keg classic was outstanding!",4
"Over crowded booth
Over cooked dinner",2
The keg is always reliable. The steaks are always good always great! The only chain restaurant I will go to.,4
"Our food was perfectly cooked and delicious. Our server Alicia was friendly, attentive and gave a great wine recommendation!",4
Awesome service and food. Would absolutely go here agai,4
Beautiful restaurant.  We had reservations and they seated us immediately. Food was delicious.  Staff was accommodating and we had an enjoyable evening!,4
"Our waiter never introduced himself, never really checked on us, and didn't bother showing any personal rapport.

When paying, he just hovered and stared at us, as if expecting a good tip. Judging if not.

Terrible service, never really made it about us, and food came slow.",2
"It was great food, fast service. Amazing experience",4
Food was outstanding and they were very cautious with our allergies,4
"Blackend Chicken was good, loved the garlic mashed potatoes.",4
Great evening!  Staff was very good.  Food was great.  Perfect evening!,3
"We waited waited for a very long time for our food to arrive. We thought that an hour and a half should be enough time for dinner as we had a show to attend. Kids didn't get to have their desserts as we had to rush to get get to the show. They were pretty upset. Overall, the food was great as always but services needed some working on, as at time we couldn't locate our server.",2
Muy mala mesa en un pasillo sin vista al restaurante,2
"Our server was Skylar.   His  attention to detail , spectacular level of service and wonderful presence made the whole evening really memorable-     Truly a night our friends and my husband will never forget.

I have food allergies- these were handled with great care
:   Great Wine  and food suggestions made.   Constant checking on us for anything needed ‚Ä¶.in a friendly, approachable but very professional manner.

He took the time to get to know us and what was important to us.  Bravo!   And all the best!

We will be back!!",4
Can never go wrong at the Keg . Service (Matt again) is always great as is the food. Perfect pre Leaf game dinner.,4
"Service was great, but food was just okay.  I find with the keg, it can be hit or miss‚Ä¶",2
"We booked for Valentines Day at the last minute. Grateful we got a reservation.

The food, as always, was delicious; the service attentive; and the atmosphere perfect for conversation.",4
"Service was impeccable. Unfortunately my husbands steak was a little tough.  He‚Äôs not one to complain. When he told our server, she immediately took it back. One of the managers came over and apologized and asked if there was anything she could do. They replaced his whole meal.   
They were very generous.  We were very pleased with our night at the Keg, York street. 

Will definitely go back.",3
"Amazing service by our server Katie. Food was delicious, large portions and very tasteful.",4
A great experience at York Street Keg! Food was delicious and service was outstanding! Thank you for another memorable celebration.,4
The 20 oz Rib steak was awesome. Our server even made the whole evening betterüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª.,4
Great place to celebrate birthdays.  Great food and great service!,4
"I frequent the Keg often, not necessarily the same location but I have been to this location a few times in the last year. This time was by far one of the best visits I‚Äôve had at any Keg. Our server Skylar was amazing, great service, good conversation and easy to deal with. Food was amazing, same with the wine. Not one issue. I‚Äôll be back to this location sooner than later.",4
"We had a nice meal in the lounge/bar and our server was excellent. The only downside was there were small kids laying on chairs and sleeping near our table. If you‚Äôre going to welcome kids in a downtown restaurant at 9pm on a Friday night, they should not be in the bar.",3
Was great!,3
Food was on point as usual. I go to the Keg all the time but the server was legit full of attitude which is something I've never experienced at the Keg. Maybe it was because not all of us ordered alcohol but that doesn't excuse the attitude. At other locations they put amarena cherries in my cocktails but I didn't get them in my drink this time.,3
"Had a business lunch at The Keg (York Street), first time back since the start of the pandemic (which interestingly was where I had my last meal out on the day before the lockdowns started).  Service was great despite us being amongst the first in.  My colleague and I both started with the onion soup, which was hearty and hot.  I had the prime rib with Caesar salad for my entree and he had the prime rib sandwich.  Both were properly cooked and tasty.  As we both had afternoon meetings, no dessert or coffee, but overall a very enjoyable meal.",3
Wonderful environment and a great meal.,4
"This is a great place to dine. The server was amazing, and the ambiance was very good.",3
"The service was fantastic. The food was absolutely delicious. The atmosphere was lovely, quiet and had a fabulous time. Thank you",4
It was the best medium rare prime rib I‚Äôve ever had at the Keg.  Excellent.,3
"Nice location, wait staff friendly,hostess accommodating. Food tasty. Salad asked for dressing on the side was served precoated. Herb butter and warm bread amazing. Open table login confirmed account and  reservation via email. My special birthday request was not recognized by your comment section.",2
"Steak was amazing, but the Caesar salad was pedestrian and the service wasn‚Äôt very attentive. Unfortunately we were stuck beside a 22 person table. Still very good.",4
"Excellent service! Food was really good, drinks and everything ‚ú®",4
Birthday dinner,3
This Keg restaurant is perfect location being close to subway and Union Station. Our server was very attentive & helpful. Prime rib cooked to perfection as always followed by their famous Billy Miner pie. Perfect end to a perfect meal!,4
We had a great evening at the keg!  Amazing food as always and great service!,4
Loved the rod and wine!,4
Excellent food and service as always! See you soon!,4
Dinner before the theatre,3
"The Keg has always been our favourite restaurant.  This was our 1st visit to this location.  Food was fantastic as always, but the service was terrible.  My order came out wrong, and we barely ever saw our server - always needing to flag someone else down when we needed another beverage.",1
"Always a great dining experience. Steaks cooked perfectly every time, comfortable seating and attentive pleasant service.",4
"The keg York street was great, our server Emma was very helpful and kind.",4
Great food and service!,4
"Come on....it's the Keg
They have their formula down to an exact science.
Great service just added to the experience.",4
The service was excellent and Jonathan our server was the best we have had at any restaurant in any city for years. He really went above and beyond to make a night out with my wife perfect.  Great place to enjoy top quality food and service. The KEG.,4
Nice meal before the Harry Potter play. Great server and high quality food.,3
As always it was amazing.  Always know what you're going to get at The Keg.  The food is terrific and service always great.,4
Keg is always great for pre Leaf meal.,4
"If you're in the mood for steak, you can't go wrong at The Keg! Juicy steak, cooked the way you like. Try a delicious appetizer to start, and if you order the Classic you get salad and an accompaniment. I was too full to order dessert. The service was attentive without being intrusive.",3
"My friend and me had the most delicious steak, light fried calamari and the house famous pie for dessert . Our server Johanna was incredibly attentive, very helpful and courteous‚Ä¶ she made us WOW!! 
Reasonable price as well, so I will definitely recommend this place and if it‚Äôs possible will request‚Äô Johanna ‚Äò for the luxury service.",3
Everything was absolutely amazing‚Ä¶definitely looking forward to the next visit,4
"Jennifer was a great host, super thoughtful in bringing us two cakes for a new hire on our team and a birthday. Thanks!",4
"Food was excellent , server was wonderful ! 
It was rather noisy with a peculiar soundtrack for the age of diner they generally get there .",4
"Had a birthday dinner and tried out this location for the first time. The food was not as good as the King street location. We also had bugs on our table going into our food. The server was friendly but was constantly busy serving another section. The manager reacted to the situation well, took care of our mains and our appetiser but expected a lot more in general from the Keg. The food was bland (steak, potatoes, and vegetables) and we couldn‚Äôt really send it back as when we were asked how it was, we were half way done with the meal. The manager didn‚Äôt touch our table after the conversation about the incident and that surprised us. Wouldn‚Äôt repeat at this location, but we love the Keg as a brand and would definitely visit elsewhere.",1
Our waitress Emma was friendly and courteous.  Had a nice evening,4
"our early arrival was accommodated; food was all good; nice timing of arrival of courses. asked for no butter, arrived with butter...not the end of the world. Waitress did her best to satisfy. nice spacing of patrons between tables, felt private",3
Very good service from getting seated through to the end of our meal.,4
"Great service, and our dinners were perfect!
Thank you!",4
We waited for over 45 minutes for our food and we ordered 3 salads and two sirloin.  The table beside us came after us and got their food and drinks before us.  We asked another server when our food would be coming he checked and said soon then our waitress came over and didn‚Äôt say anything about the delay or wait but did role her eyes when I asked how long we have been waiting,2
Took a while to flag down someone so we can get the bill.  And it was LOUD.,2
Food was good,3
"I enjoy the ambiance, service and food at the Keg, on York Street.  I dine there, often, and It is always a very pleasant experience.",3
The service we received was fast and efficient. Service was very accommodating to our reservation and the fact that some parties were arriving later. Our waitress was attentive and friendly.,4
Best steak I‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôve been to the keg a lot - but this was different. Blue cheese filled was like butter.  Our sever was great! Ambiance was beautiful. Two thumbs up.,4
"Excellent service and excellent food, we went two nights in a row!",4
The food was great! And the server was really nice. My son and I really enjoyed our time. The filet mignon was really tasty even without a peppercorn sauce. The ambience was nice too. I love the fireplace. I will definitely go back.,4
"This is one of the best locations of The Keg, overall. Service is great and the food was good. Treat yourself to the tuna tartare ‚Ä¶ one of the bests in town.",4
"We love coming to this Keg restaurant! We had a fantastic experience! Our waitress Brittany was the best, she was super friendly and made our experience even more magical! We will definitely be returning!",4
A wonderful special occasion celebration and the surprised cake by the Manager at the end of our dinner was a wonderful touch.  Great steaks!!,4
"Was lovely to have a nice dinner with my friends.
Patryck was a great server and was on top of all of our needs.",4
"Not up to the usual Keg standard. 

The food was nice, but very rushed. The steaks were delivered to the table while we were still eating our appetizers/salads, my steak was cold by the time I got to it. The timing was extremely disappointing.

Service was not what we have experiences in the past either.",2
Food was great! We had a great evening celebrating my husband's birthday.,4
"Enjoyed night out with family at The Keg. Great service, even helped celebrate a birthday. Food delish, server terrific.",4
Never disappointed with the service and food at the Keg. Top notch restaurant,4
Excellent service and predictable good food. Asked for a quiet table and got one!,4
"Amazing food as usual, great fast and friendly service",4
Our waiter was fantastic and the food was delicious,4
Lovely evening ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ as always. Steaks were excellent and our server ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ simply delightful. Staff at The Keg are always amazing.,3
"Great service by April. Good food, it was cooked exactly how we wanted it. Got a semi window table although I asked for a window table for our anniversary. Small selection of white wine Pinot Grigio. We still liked the bottle se picked.",4
The waitress we had went above and beyond to meet our allergy needs and made sure everything was good throughout the meal + the managers where amazing as well. We got sat earlier than our reservation which was great.,4
Excellent service by Rio .  Reservations are required to ensure prompt seating.,4
Great food and great service always a great place to go,4
"We arrived 15 minutes early, but only waited 5 minutes to be seated.
Then it took 15 minutes before the waiter came.
The beverage and food orders came quickly.
The food was very good.
The staff were pleasant and polite.",2
"My son has a severe food allergy and our server is extremely diligent on handling our food request. The food was great, service is great.",4
Everything was excellent. My steak was cooked to perfection. Great place. I will definitely return.,4
Skylar was our server & very good to us.,4
"The Keg is consistently excellent. York Street location is no different - great food and service. I have celiac disease and I appreciate how careful the Keg staff are, to ensure that we can avoid any dishes that contain gluten. Thank you for your delicious, gluten-free food!",4
Service was excellent and the food was very good.  Really enjoyed the creme Brulee.  First time trying the prime rib; I like the steak better.,4
"The Keg has been our family ""go-to"" for celebratory dinners. It never disappoints. I particularly like the Keg on York Street. Nice, modern decor and great service. Can count on excellent Prime Rib and a nice wine list as well.",4
"Always good food and service at the Keg. Consistency, nice setting and good value.",3
"My evening was nice but I left a small wallet on the table or it fell out of my purse. 
Really small wallet the size of a credit card. It holds five credit cards and I had cash inside. Even if the wallet is empty please notify me me for the wallet. It was a gift. 
Thank you, Rhonda Hall 4169095707",3
This location has the best ambience and is conveniently located on the PATH.,4
"I really liked the feel of the restaurant, it gives off expensive vibes, but I‚Äôve gotta say the food is not the best, and don‚Äôt match the vibe. Our food took forever, and then one of the plates was undercooked. The appetizer and the main plate was bland. Our server, however, was excellent.",2
"Overall a moderately positive experience, however waiting almost an hour for a steak it's really borderline acceptable. Offering an appetizer or a drink in these kind of situation would make it more pleasant.",2
Our food took an hour and a half to arrive and our server did not communicate that there was clearly issues in the kitchen that evening. We told him as soon as we sat that we were a little pressed for time and he said that it wouldn't be an issue. We barely got to touch our food before we left. Complete waste of money.,0
"Everything was great with the first round of drinks, appetizers came out so quickly and the food was right out of the kitchen very hot and fresh. The only issue we had was it took close to an hour to have our entrees brought to the table and we had even ordered everything at once as soon as we sat down at the table so there was no reason it should have taken that long. We had to ask our server how much longer the entrees would be as we had plans at Scotiabank Arena for 8pm. Our reservation was for 5:45 and at 7:15 we were still waiting for entrees. Keep in mind we ordered drinks, apps, and entrees all at the beginning of our reservation since we knew we only had about a 1.5hour window. When our entrees finally arrived the steaks were room temperature and the liquids from the steak and vegetables were dried on the plate. We didn‚Äôt have time to mention to the server how mediocre the steaks were as we were running close on time. I love the keg and I will definitely return but this visit was lack lustre for me. The restaurant was not crazy busy either so there was no reason it should have taken that long. The excuse we were given was the kitchen was backed up. Maybe it was a one-off experience but it did add stress to missing our pre-planned show for 8pm.",2
We had a great dinner at the Keg ! The service was amazing .!The food was good ! Could not have asked for a better evening !,4
Wasn't satisfied with my reservations for the new year. My request prior to booking wasn't considered. There was a piece of wood in my champagne.,0
Was a lovely place to have a New Years dinner with my partner. Really enjoyed the food and excellent service. I would recommend this location to anyone in Toronto,4
"Keg is always so awesome! The food, the service and the ambiance is top notch. My most favourite restaurant!! Can never ever stop eating here. Thanks!",4
Delish food as usual and the service was lovely!,3
"I've been many times, I don't know if it's because it was new years eve and very busy but the steak was awful. I ordered a 10 ounce fillet medium and it was cooked on one side well done and rare on the other. 

Service was good.
Spent $300 on dinner.
Disappointing.",2
"Had a wonderful New-years dinner with the family. 

A very nice contemporary steakhouse experience. 
It‚Äôs a great value over all.",4
"Honestly, The Keg on York St is fabulous. The service I had on NYE was incredible. The food came quickly, it was hot and Alex the waiter was very kind and polite. 

Thank you so much for a wonderful dining experience. I will definitely come back.",4
We were very pleased with the food and the ambience and the service.,4
Waiter Steven was excellent. Really enhanced our experience.,4
"The York downtown location is a gem. The staff is attentive, kind and come around when you need them

The food was great value and the best steak I've had in the past 10 years",4
Delicious as always but very disappointed that the sundae is no longer on the dessert menu.,4
Great food! Wonderful service! I highly recommend.,4
Baked garlic shrimp is always a winner if you want a delicious appetizer to start your meals. Steak was cooked exactly how we like it. Overall great experience.,4
"Steak whitout any question, try fried cauliflower as well",4
"The glass of water were dirty.
The bottle of water had also suspicious parts inside.
We had a great evening and the waiter (Miguel - fantastic person - 10 out of 10!!!) was excellent!!
We had a cake for desert for free! But both: glass (twice) and bottle were not clean. A great opportunity to get 5 star in everything next time.
Other than that, it is a fantastic place!",3
"We had a really great dinner to celebrate my 45th birthday. I brought my two young boys and wanted it to feel special for them - and it did. Great ambiance, excellent food, wonderful service.",4
food and service  are consistently very good. never a disappointment,3
Amazing food as always. Paul was our server and made sure to include the kids when he was speaking with the table. The ambience was wonderful. Food was cooked to perfection and delicious.,4
Our server Patrick was fantastic!  The food was great too.,4
"I always like the food at the Keg,however,yesterday I ordered the chicken pot pie and it was dreadful.
It was a gelatinous mix of vegetables and one small piece of chicken covered by a wet pastry.
I suggest the kitchen staff try it.
Gordon‚Äôs Food Service would produce a better pie.",3
"First time visit at this location and it was a total treat. Pleasant very efficient server, excellent food and very fair lunch prices. Will certainly be back.",4
"Last night, December 28, 2022 was our second time dining at The Keg (York Street). As usual, it was amazing experience - great food, great service, and great ambiance. Thank you to Paul and to the Manager that night for being so accommodating. We will definitely dine again.üòä",4
Food ok but service was slow and full of mistakes. Prices are over the top. Not going back.,2
"A lovely date night.  We had an angelic server (Brittany) that let us switch to a private table-for-two.  Brittany even let me order a slight twist to one of the cocktails.  My date and I both enjoyed Peppercorn Steaks and a shared plate of Asparagus with a dash of sauce.  It was a lovely meal and a really nice night out. - - -  Sidenote:  Initial seating arrangements were odd (semi-private shared bench) despite mentioning on the app and to the hostess that we were on a date.  But there were alot of empty private tables-for-two, so our server helped us switch.  :)",4
Server killed our night out that evening. Dining is always a hit or miss in regards to server and drinks.,1
The food was still good the first time as it was the last time,4
A great spot for dinner just before the Raptors game. The service was absolutely amazing!,4
"Dinner was amazing!
Waitress was funny and very attentive.
Cant wait to go back!",4
"We had a great time at that place. The service was so Great & having April at our table was excellent. Thanks .
Merry Christmas & See You God willing next year. ‚ô•Ô∏è",2
Great keg classic dinner and we celebrated a birthday,3
I was actually surprised at the decline in quality at this location. I‚Äôve been many times and this was a significant disappointment.,2
Great experience good food and service. Great atmophere very clean,3
"Amazing experience
S
The service is really nice and food as well",4
Twas the night of Dec 24th.  The server was courteous. The steak was good and arrived in acceptable time.  Relaxed atmosphere. The pin light directly on top of me seemed too bright in contrast to the dimmed overall ambiance.  The wine glass displayed on the table prior to dining was not pristine spotless sparkling clean. For met it's a letdown. Imho that's a big no-no. Other than the negatives it was a good evening.,3
Miguel was sooo nice !!!,4
Great food and better service. Hostesses we‚Äôre friendly and helpful,4
Usually have a great steak but this time had the worst steak. No flavour & tough.  Great server tho.,2
"We really enjoyed The Keg experience, food was super delicious, highly recommended!",4
The food and ambiance was amazing! Order the New York strip loin and it was cooked exactly the way I wanted. Our waitress was always on top of her game which was great and always made us feel looked after.,3
My friend and i got ripped off at this location. Never has this happened at any other keg,2
Was Great amazing service. Food was perfect. Prices were reasonable. Ambiance was sophisticated but warm.,4
The Keg has always been consistent. Prices seem to be creeping up but that is to be expected. Overall good night at the Keg,4
Server was outstanding.He made the evening very enjoyable.,3
The server was rude and inattentive. The section was not super busy. There were empty tables.  Been there many times and never had a bad experience like this.  It was my husband‚Äôs 65th birthday.  Very disappointed. The food was great though.  I would recommend the Keg but I will not recommend that server.,2
Our server Katie was outstanding! She recommended a red wine that was excellent. Her friendly demeanor elevated our experience. The food as usual is excellent at the Keg. The noise level was a bit high but it was the holiday season.,4
"I wait or never introduce himself. He never attempted to make small talk with us, or ask the reason for her visit. On more than one occasion, my drink remained empty.  We assume that he was simply having an off day, until we saw two other parties sat beside and adjacent to us. These groups do not include any children, and he was very polite and chatty with them. Despite all this, I still left him a tip because it‚Äôs the holiday season however, my 13-year-old stated he did not deserve one. 

The kitchen manager was very kind to us, and if it had not been, for that, this experience would‚Äôve been rated overall a one",2
"Lovely meal  be as always - French onion soup and a lemon tart after a great prime rib

Only criticizm was there was way too muck herb in the au jus

Great service",4
"Filet mignon was great, cheesecake amazing. It was noisy but fun at 8-9pm when we were there. Service was good as well.",4
The noise level was ridiculously loud. What should have been a nice dinner felt like dining in a club. Having to yell across the table as opposed to having a nice conversation.,2
Always a great experience here with excellent food and outstanding service. Best Keg in Toronto,4
Our food was delicious!!! And the server was outstanding! She was very informative and made sure we were satisfied during the dinner!,4
Our reservation was honoured without any wait.  Service was fast and friendly.  The food was served as ordered and there were no headaches.,4
This restaurant is one of our favorites and never disappoints. The food and drinks are always first class.,4
Excellent keg restaurant very good OnPoint-food was great. Bottle service was good.,4
Took way too long to be seated. our server took way too long to take our order and this was a lunch reservation so most people including us are expecting to be eating and leaving within one and half hours.,0
I normally order steaks at the Keg which are fairly good. I decided to order a blackened chicken this time. It was very salty and wouldn't order it again. A manager said it's probably the spice which was put on it.,3
The music was too loud - very difficult to have a conversation but otherwise it was a nice atmosphere.,3
The service was spectacular. The fire alarm went off and the server and manager came over to assume everyone that everything was fine and service would resume shortly. This bit of chaos was handled with such professionalism. The food was very good with vegan options on the menu. The sangria was also light and refreshing. We will be back to this location again next time we are in the area.,4
"FINALLY! 

We found a Keg that cooked my steak perfectly üòã. Tara knows EXACTLY what I'm talking about. LOL.

Everything was fantastic. Dane, our server, had all the tools a Top Notch server should have. 5/5 for this young man and if he chooses a career in the restaurant industry, I hope to see him as a manager some day.

Thank you for a delightful evening üòä",4
"An excellent dinner.  Both steaks and accompaniments were well presented and delicious.  The atmosphere and vibe at this restaurant is always just right.
Our server, Cassie, was was both friendly and knowledgeable with her helpful recommendations.
Will definitely be back next time that we are in Toronto.",4
"The Keg is always a great spot to eat.
Filet Mignon is our favourite‚Ä¶..along with Billy Minor Pie!",4
"You can always count on The Keg for a wonderful, delicious meal.",4
"Overall the experience was good.  We were seated quickly, but we did have to wait a while for our waiter to attend our table.  Overall the service was good.  The only problem we experienced was addressed satisfactorily by the restaurant.",3
"Perfect evening,  the food was sooooo delicious and well cooked. The service is great, fast and friendly.",4
"It was me and my partners anniversary, our lovely server brought us out a delicious cake to share! Great service, and best food I‚Äôve had from the keg!",4
What happened to your brownie dessert!!! It was our favourite,4
"It was our 10th anniversary.  We were seated in the bar/lounge area as an option instead of the dining area.  Nestled nicely in a corner near the fireplace, it was perfect.  Ted was our server and he was outstanding.  From taking care of the little things, to apologizing for being out of Creemore, Ted was everything you‚Äôd want in a server.  Attentive and clear, jovial and professional, Ted even went as far as showing me where the washroom was instead of just telling me.  The meal and evening were perfect.  We will return, and hopefully will have Ted as our server.  Thanks",4
The food is very mediocre. Ambience and service are nice.,2
"Amazing dinner, service, and atmosphere!  A memorable experience!",3
We had a show to attend at 7 pm and Aaron our severer was aware and we finished in plenty of time to attend our show.,4
Our server was fantastic!!! Food was amazing and I‚Äôll definitely go back,4
Appetizers were great but when our dinner came they forgot my daughters chicken fingers and my husband‚Äôs steak was too fatty and the mashed potatoes and gravy were cold. Cheesecake was delicious.,2
I appreciated a festive glass of prosecco as I waited for my friends to arrive. Nice touch.,3
Loved our server.  She was super friendly and helpful,4
"Excellent service and food
Will be back soon
Thank you",4
Always nice coming to the keg. Food consistent and thanks Lisa for the great service.,4
Went out if the way to help us accomodate for food preferences. Extremely good service and food was great too! Perfectly cooked steak to the requested temperature,4
Lovely dinner - only complaint was the Billy miner pie I got to go was all but melted when they brought it out,4
"Foods were excellent, the service was perfect. We'll do it again.",4
Great service and great food!,4
Excellent service and food quality has returned to a pre covid time.,4
We had a rude server who kept forgetting to bring things we ordered. We asked for the same things multiple times and he just seemed like he really didn‚Äôt want to be there.,1
"Really enjoyed the food, service and overall experience of the Keg on York Street.  Simply a great place to have dinner.",4
"Food was wonderful and our server was exceptional!
His name was Steven and he did everything possible to make sure we got to our event that evening on time.
He really took care of us!!
Somehow I hope management can let him know how appreciated his wonderful service was!!
Truly a great dining experience!!",4
Very impressed with service quality and attention.   Music could be a bit lower volume.  Hard to have conversation. Overall very satisfied with York Street location experience,4
Before the Nutcracker with our Granddaughter,4
"Grear good, great staff with lots of attentiveness!",4
"Our waiter was fun and knowledgeable and very attentive.  The food was very good, everyone enjoyed their meal.  This group always gets together always at The Keg, as the food and service are always great and the cost is reasonable.",4
Our sever was amazing and the food quality was superb.,4
"Wonderful evening. Great service 
Steak was spectacular",4
"Our server Ash, was very attentive at all the right times and very accommodating with our odd request. The food did take a little long to get to the table but very worth it, probably the best food I‚Äôve had at the keg very happy with the experience and will definitely go back to that location",2
"Really enjoyed my night, good food, great service.",4
"Had made reservations for dinner prior to a show. They were unable to seat us at our reservation time and we ended up waiting 30 mins to be seated.

We were ready to order right away, but service was incredibly slow. We ended up only able to eat our appetizers and having to leave and cancel our mains, in order to not miss our show. 

I would not suggest going prior to a game, show, Etc. we gave ourselves 2 hours and it ended up not being enough time to even eat.",1
We waited 2 hours for dinner -arrived at 4:30pm on a Saturday. Otherwise the food was good quality and taste. They rushed our order and forgot our salad. A bit expensive.,2
"Great dinner. Not the first time we've been to The Keg. The food was delicious as always. We ordered the shrimp cocktail and scallops & bacon to start. Moved onto a prime rib and the Kansas City Striploin.  Service was friendly, attentive and helpful (Sorry, I forgot our servers name). Overall a great dining experience.",4
We had a lovely server who was able to help us make our train whilst not making us feel rushed or panicked. She was very profession and made our night 10x better.,4
Great service my sever was warm and guaranteed the food was awesome,4
Great service from the moment we arrived with an exceptional meal. Everything was great.,4
Server was inexperienced. Very poor service. Food was not cooked to our request and specifications.,0
Boys night out,4
Always order my steak ‚Äúblue‚Äù which can be a problem but they nailed it! We were seated in the back which really lowered noise and added to ambiance for special night. Waitress Nicky was awesome!,4
Absolutely perfect ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..,4
They were pretty busy at lunch but the food took a long time to be delivered. Management did recognize this and apologized which was appreciated.,3
"Server was excellent.
My filet was undercooked, manager replaced with a properly prepared filet.
Bread was stale.
Billy Miner pie was brought to the table for birthday, nice gesture.",3
"Taylor did a great job, Restaurant was too loud",2
"The au jus was watery and tasteless! Far inferior than it has been previously. Also this is the second time my order was delivered incorrectly and the bill was incorrect as well. Those last issues were corrected well, however I won‚Äôt come back if the au jus  problem isn‚Äôt ameliorated.",2
Good Keg food in central Toronto,2
Great food and fantastic service.,4
Perfect service . Fair price . Quality of food is great. Would go again !,4
We had a very enjoyable time at The Keg. We will definitely return,4
"Usually the Keg is very consistent, but unfortunetly not only did certain items, just never arrive that we were charged for, we also had made specific requests for dietary restrictions that were not followed.",1
The staff from the hostess to our server was excellent.  He was very attentive to us but not in a overwhelming way. The steaks we ordered were cooked exactly to our liking. I will be back as it was a very pleasant experience.,4
"The service was excellent. Present when needed service but not ¬´¬†pushy ¬´¬† to get us out.  Prime Rib was excellent as usual, and served at a good pass .  For a chain restaurant we did not feel like a ¬´¬†chany¬†¬ª atmosphere.  The only nigative comment is the limited selection of French wines.",4
The management here is amazing great customer service.,4
Great dinner at the Keg.  Service was very good.  Even got an offer of bubble while waiting for our table.,4
"Service was impeccable, food was amazing as usual",4
"Love going to the Keg in 50 years @ lots of locations,never had a bad meal or experience, consistently good",4
"Very busy location, great food and service",3
"Great service even though they were really busy, enjoyed the free glass of bubbly while we waited for our table",4
"The Keg is one of our favorite places to go.  The food is consistently good, the prices are in line with other restaurants in the area and the service is always friendly and effiicent.",3
"Always great food, great service!",4
"I had advised this was an 80th birthday lunch at time of reservation and to server.  We waited 45m for our food. The order for the person celebrating his birthday was incorrect. Zero acknowledgment of the birthday. They often bring out a slice of cake with a candle. 
I frequented this location on average once a week pre Covid and new several staff/managers by name. I work across the street.  Disappointing experience. 

I did flag to one of the managers who was highly receptive. I‚Äôm hoping it was a one off",2
"The food was amazing, i tried a new appy Ceasar Brussel sprouts and they were amazing! i was traveling and i am not really ambitious about trying new places or foods but i know i can count on The Keg to serve me a great meal. Thank you!",4
You can never get tired of The Keg. Their tried and true menu can be counted on every time and the seasonal specials keep it fresh. I can‚Äôt think of any other establishment that delivers greater value.,3
Simon was absolutely terrific. We really loved the Caesar Brussels sprouts!,4
The service was great but the bathrooms were almost empty of TP in every stall‚Ä¶.the fries were cold and old tasting‚Ä¶.,3
Good was good staff very friendly,3
Great food and a great atmosphere. This was my first time going on a Sunday. It was surprisingly busy for a restaurant this size. I know on Thursday nights after work it's packed.,4
It was a fairly busy night when we went. It took half an hour for someone to attend to us and 45 minutes to get our drinks. My husbands drink was fine but mine was watered down. The food was delicious.,2
What an amazing experience! Thank you to our great server for taking great care of us !,4
"The food is great. We tried one of the festive winter appetizers, the mushroom Gruy√®re cheese dip, it was delicious ü§§!!! Highly recommend. 

One disappointing thing was we were celebrating my fianc√©‚Äôs birthday, which we told the waitress about, but unfortunately we never received a slice of birthday cake. :(.",4
"Excellence service, and they always deal with my mom's allergies with absolute care and professionalism.",4
Delicious dinner and ambience. Our server seemed somewhat ambivalent about serving us. The Keg is a special dining out experience and I think he needed a little more engagement. But overall I had a very good dinner with my two daughters.,3
This was an amazing dining experience from beginning to end. One of the best Keg steaks I have ever had. My only note would be to avoid the bar area if you don't like a noisy environment - the dining room was very relaxing.,4
"Hostesses were very friendly and helpful!  We sat in the bar area and had drinks and apples as we were very early for our table.  The hostesses offered to sit us despite this but we decided to sit at bar.  When we came back to the front, they recognized us and sat us quickly.  Our wait staff, Jonathan, was very knowledgeable and friendly.  He was at our table every time we needed him - he seemed to know!  Any requests were made quickly.  Food was perfect temperature and perfectly cooked.  The Billy Miner pie was soooo good we ordered a second one!!

We usually go to the Keg on Argentina in Mississauga but we were downtown for a Mirvish Show!!  Love the Keg!!

Anne and John",4
"We felt the noise level for a steakhouse was quite sufficient from customer conversation, without adding thumping music to it. It makes it hard to hear for conversation. Overall our dining experience could have been much quieter.",4
Excellent evening even though we did not take advantage of the complimentary  birthday dessert.,4
"Really enjoyed the happy hour pricing on wine and bar snacks. The cauliflower bites were prepared differently than I've had before. They had more sauce on them, and the coating was falling off, which hasn't happened before. The Caesar salad with chicken was awful (the chicken was rubbery/hard and I couldn't eat it, and the salad dressing was very tart and not very creamy) - the manager compensated me for the salad by taking it off my bill.  It was a very busy time there, being after-work hours and dinner time and FIFA world cup games on TV, the food came out very slowly. The server we had was delightful.  Very fast to bring out drinks and refills, checked on us often, warned us the  kitchen was behind. She was great.",3
"Went with family for a birthday celebration. Food and atmosphere was great as usual but what stood out the most was the excellent service from the waiter Stephen L.  Very attentive and professional. Out of all the times we‚Äôve been to the Keg, he‚Äôs provided the best service.",4
"Fantastic dinner experience.  Exceptional greeting at the entrance, as well as service, food and not a long wait for our food.  Dinner was  perfectly cooked.",4
"Always consistent and dependable.  Great service, quality food, and decent prices.  Only issue is the noise level which is a concern given my hearing impairment.  However we were seated in an area that was quieter that made our visit enjoyable.  Definitely would visit again without hesitation!",4
"Amazing experience ( as usual) it was my boyfriends birthday and our Server Stephanie was beyond amazing. Loved the food, the service, the drinks, the ambiance .... EVERYTHING we always come from far east to downtown for dinner here as we always have a wonderful experience. Thank you all for the great birthday dinner üôÇ",4
"Just lovely. Food was amazing, service was amazing and everything was perfect!",4
"My wife and I went there to celebrate her birthday. Excellent meal, great service and a very enjoyable evening.
We both had filets and they were cooked perfectly. We had never tried the lobster tail and it was very tender and tasted superb.
Hats off to Kisha, our server and Matt, the manager for a very memorable enjoyable evening.",4
"The food and service was excellent, great portion sizes and cooked to perfection.  I will definitely be back",4
Great place. - always make sure to have a meal here when in Toronto.,4
great service.... food timing was a bit off so the prime rib was overcooked a bit but they made it right by not charging us and threw in a a billy miner pie!,4
"Keg is always good and always consistent from location to location. 
Love the teriyaki steak, veggies and of course the hot (free) sour dough.",4
Food and ambiance are sooooo great! We love our server Sara so much. We will definitely come back again.üòä‚ù§Ô∏è,4
"never a disappointment

consistent above average service and food quality",4
"Our food was fantastic, we were seated in a great area and our server was great.",4
We had an outstanding waiter who made the whole experience that much better. Kudos to your terrific wait staff,4
"We have been at this location multiple times, usually after theatre, etc. Food well prepared as usual, friendly efficient service, even though it was almost full when we finished up.",3
The best stake ever! Very nice service! We will be back!,4
"Our server Patrick was very attentive and personable. Food is average but the service definitely makes up for it. 
The chilli mango margarita was fantastic.",3
"It took a while for our server to arrive, but once she arrived her service was excellent. The food was superb.",3
"Had a great experience, from the top notch service to the excellent food.",4
Staff from start to finish were excellent and took care of all my particular requests and needs perfectly.,4
Excellent meal and overall experience....always great value,4
First time visiting and definitely not last. Server welcomed us and gave us the full Keg first timer experience and gave us her personal recommendations when asked! Such an amazing experience will be back next time we visit Toronto.,4
"The Keg is consistent, and last night did not disappoint. Tasty cocktails to start.  We enjoyed our meals and they were as expected. Ordered the Barolo, great price point for an enjoyable wine.",3
Great work! Server Stacey was really great too. We enjoyed ourselves. Thank you!,4
Excellent prime rib! Qwertuioogffdghhgfghhgfhhhhhhh,4
"The plate was hot food was cold, steak wasn‚Äôt cooked as ordered and the service was extremely slow.  It took over 2 hours for us to complete our lunch.

Having said that, the staff was great in fixing the issues above without question and I understand the labour market these days so we‚Äôre much more forgiving.

Still done work to do and I‚Äôm hoping that was an anomaly.  Booking again for next month with a visiting vendor and hope the experience will be to the kegs typical standard.",2
I think for anniversary night they could offer a better table to us but totally I enjoyed,3
great environment/ambience and really terrific food.   service was terrible,2
The prime rib was excellent! The booth helped reduce the noise level but it was noisy. Lovely server. I highly recommend this venue for dinner before the show at the Four Seasons Centre.,4
Excellent evening...food and service excellent....see you again soon!,4
Convocation,4
Amazing service,4
Amazing food and service. Overall is perfect recommend to everyone,4
"Excellent food, service was flawless, attentive and fast.",4
I had the salmon which was dry and must have been sitting under a heat lamp too long.,2
"Great experience from beginning to end. Our server Ashley was bubbly and wonderful, the food was delicious and the ambiance was lively and decor was nice. Would definitely recommend.",4
Great service. Visiting my sister. Great food first time in this Keg. Excellent server excellent food as always.,4
Love the keg. Consistently delicious and good value.,4
Excellent experience!,4
Work guests in from overseas,4
"Excellent food, great service and professional service",4
Always consistently good food. A great spot to catch up with friends.,4
Overall it was a great experience.,4
"as always, the Keg never disappoints.  Two members of our dinner party had allergies and the manager came over to ensure that their meals would be handled with care.  Very good experience",4
"Booked the Keg for a last minute lunch meeting, they were very accommodating, quiet enough to allow for conversation and the food was good! The server went the extra mile to offer me additional vegan options from their dinner menu, which I appreciated.",4
"Party of 5, it was almost an hour from when we were seated till our lunch order was served to our table. Our waitress disappeared for almost 15 minutes, when she arrived back to the table she asked if we needed anything and I responded ""yes, our lunch, we have been here almost an hour"". When food was brought out, no apology for the delay.",1
"Food is consistently good, service efficient, prices have increased - it‚Äôs an expensive night out.",3
Decent steakhouse. Nothing special,4
"We went there as for a birthday celebration. I put it in the request for the table saying it was a birthday celebration When we arrived there we had to wait for a reservation which wasn‚Äôt a problem, but then the greeter asked if we were there for any celebration??  Which was then a surprise to the person that was having a birthday celebration, then the seater told me to inform the server that it was a birthday celebration!!  So what was point putting in the request in that it was a surprise celebration in the first place. The server kept clearing the table dishes  faster than we could eat the food!! It was here‚Äôs your hat what‚Äôs your hurry?? Thanks you‚Äôre done I was very disappointed in the lack of timing & the service. The food was as usual very good but the price has been present astronomically compared to what it was! It will be a long time before we will be going back ü•≤",2
"It was our 33rd anniversary.  And yes we have a Keg nearby, but I know the York St location has been upgraded from the local operations.

Our server, Kevin was very attentive.  He made us feel like he wanted our evening to be extra special.",4
Never disappoints! Delicious! Great prime rib.  Huge portion!,4
Great steak dinner in keeping with the consistent reputation of The Keg for a delicious steaks made to order. Outstanding service. Highly recommend for a dependably good meal.,4
"Food ,service was excellent! Will definitely return on my next trip to Toronto.",4
Keg always our go to !! Always great service and the food it‚Äôs DELICIOUS ü§§,4
Food was great. Service was great. Overall great experience!,4
"Si mangia bene, mi √® piaciuto.
Grande Attenzione alle allergie",4
Service was amazing! Paul made sure we were taken care of. The food was delicious and the ambience was perfect for a romantic date night. Will definitely be revisiting!,4
"Very good food at an affordable price. And our waitress, Britney, was outstanding!",3
Always a great experience.  This is why we keep coming back after attending the TSO at Roy Thompson Hall.  I cannot remember our servers name but he was excellent as always.,3
"I came during the lunch break to take my new assistant for lunch. Our waiter, Steven, was exceptional! Took care of us from the get go and made sure we were not missing anything on the table. If I could say one thing it's that the service is too long because they are sooooo busy! If you go for your lunch break anticipate about two hours, especially if you're getting apps first. Anyway Steven made sure we had a great experience and I will definitely come back. :)",3
"Food was great, but service a little slow. Took a long time to get glass of water.",2
"If you're looking for great food, drinks and service, The Keg is the place to be!
Paul Mc was our very attentive and knowledgeable server. Each and every recommendation made was spectacular and the food .... oh wow!!! 


Definitely recommend this restaurant.",4
"The service was Amazing, food was outstanding. The staff  was kind and friendly.",4
"The meals we had and the service were great. My only complaint is the lack of gluten free food now. We had 2 choices, Steak or wedge salad. Why were all of the gluten free items taken away?",3
Mediocre food and drinks but good service.,2
"Made the reservation the day before because The Keg is consistent with their food. I ordered a bottle of wine, Konselmann Merlot from a near by winery in Niagara on the Lake. Then a starter, escargot, perfect, love their spice combination. Then ordered a classic filet mignon dinner, came with a starter ceasar salad and a side. Seasonal vegetables were cooked perfectly. Our server was attentive and quick with service, as it was our anniversary, we enjoyed a complimentary Billy Miner Pie for dessert. A very good meal.",3
"Good as always was great. I ordered the filet mignon with mixed vegetables. Meat was cooked to perfection. I got lots of vegetables which I was really happy about. We ordered white Sangria which was mostly ice and hardly any juice or alcohol which was disappointing. I‚Äôve had Sangria at the same location and it was really good, so I don‚Äôt know why it was so watery this time. We were going to a show so I didn‚Äôt bother complaining because we just didn‚Äôt have the time to wait. Service was good.",3
"Overall enjoyable, however we had a theatre time and we ordered a specialty coffee which took long to come out, to be stone cold.. they deducted from our bill but we never drank it so I wouldn't have paid for it anyways..",2
"Great atmosphere. 
Beat meal I‚Äôve ever had at The Keg. 
Our waitress was wonder and an absolute delight.",4
Our new favorite Keg location. Had a great wedding anniversary. Thank you!,4
Waiter who served us (don't remember his name) was fantastic.  Very attentive and personable.  A wonderful dining experience.,4
We had a wonderful experience last night that is typical of The Keg. Our server was very pleasant and looked after all our needs. We always enjoy our visits to The Keg.,4
"Geishelle was fantastic, very knowledgeable and perfect amount of service given. Food was amazing and the wine we ordered was served professionally.  Thank you we will be back.",4
Service was excellent!,4
"Pepper steak that we ordered was good but all vegetables were warm at best.

Very, very noisy

Need a flashlight to see the menu",3
Waited 1 hour between appetiser and main dish....meat a bit tough and not aa my previous visits,1
"I sent my daughter and her friends there to celebrate her birthday.  I notified them during the reservation that it was her birthday and even called ahead and spoke to a manager so they would know to send dessert with a candle after dinner.   They totally forgot, very disappointing.",2
Great food,4
Great food and great service!! Would recommend,4
Main course was unfortunately served before Appetizer was finished. The assistance because of my soy allergy was very good.,3
Food and service was awesome!,4
"The food was great, as always.
The waitress was very professional , especially regarding taking care for our kid allergy issue.",4
Tr√®s belle ambiance.  La nourriture est excellente.  Le service  est extraordinaire.  Les gens ont l‚Äôair heureux d‚Äôy travailler.,4
We took the kids before Harry Potter and had an Amazing Experience.,4
The nice thing about The Keg is the consistency between restaurants.  It is why you don't mind paying the extra it costs for a meal you know is going to be great.,4
"Service was excellent, food was delicious as always.",4
We were promptly seated even though we were early. Table was in a quiet area. Food was terrific as always!,4
"I would say average service , steak was excellent‚Ä¶ side dishes poor and very poor plating / presentation - way too many under cooked fries thrown on the plate - vegetables just thrown on the plate. Not a good look
In addition with the pre dinner sour dough bread we were presented with 3 cheese butter ‚Ä¶ seriously?  When questioned the server said we need to ask for true butter. I would think it would be that other way around",2
"Very loud , server was excellent.  Apps were so so had the escargot and baked shrimp. Mains were good . Prime rib and new york steak.",3
Great food and service within a nice setting. However very loud from both patrons and staff talking together right outside our booth.,3
"The food, ambiance, service was all great. My particular favourite thing about the night was that my dining partner was stuck in traffic and 30 minutes late, and our server never once made me feel self conscious. I felt very well taken care of!",4
"It was very noisy and the staff were really run off their feet, but overall it was a lovely lunch and I look forward to returning in the future.",3
All good as usual re food and service,4
Excellent service and good food.,3
"We were there for our 2 year anniversary and baby moon. The staff was very kind, professional and I have a shellfish allergy and they really took it into account. When we go back will definitely eat there again!",4
My steaks were cool in 5 min,3
Alex was amazing. My friends and I enjoyed our food as well.,4
"Decided to make reservations when hubby and I were in town for a show and early anniversary weekend away! Started with the Mango Basil Mule and delicious bread. Not sure what precisely is mixed with the butter spread but the flavor is delightful! We both opted for Filet Mignon and they were cooked to our specifications. Personally would've loved a little more crusted pepper on the exterior but it was still tasty. The twice baked potato and vegetables were divine and paired perfectly! My only regret was not being able to finish everything! Service was attentive without overbearing and, while it was busy, it didn't feel that way while seated at our table.",3
"When booking I mentioned it was out anniversary. Every other year we've gotten wished happy anniversary and a dessert on the house, at other locations.. but this one did nothing. Why bother asking if it's a special occasion? Food was over salted, cold and just not great. We've never had such a poor experience at the keg before.",1
"Enjoyed cocktails and snacks i. The lounge.  Garrett was a friendly, efficient server.",4
"Great atmosphere, great food.
The service (Steven) was so proffesional and kind.. Highly recomended restaurant",4
"We went to the keg on York for dinner last night. We were very pleased with our server as she was very kind and knowledgeable. However to be honest it was one of the worst keg experiences with regards to food we have had. Usually the food and beverages come very quick, however we had to wait a fair while after we ordered our beverage for it to come to the table. When it came time for our meal, it was almost as though my prime rib had been sitting under heat lamps for 15/20 minutes. My mushrooms were all wrinkled, and the meat instead of it being a beautiful medium rare, it had lost a lot of its pink and looked more medium. Just not the same level that you expect from ‚ÄúThe Keg‚Äù. Left us disappointed when we left.",2
"good food, great service; had the wings and they were great",4
"Decent ambience, quality food and drink, prompt service!",3
"usual excellence in service, food and experience
so, so reliable",4
food took a little longer than I expected but other than that everything was amazing!,3
"Standard excellent dining experience at the Keg on York. Great food, excellent service, and an ideal setting for a business lunch.",4
"Perfect place to a romantic diner .
Food was very good",4
"Patrick was a great server. He made our dinner that much more enjoyable. Our meals was great, as always.",4
One can never go wrong with the Keg...very good quality food..excellent service ..great value !,4
"Can‚Äôt beat The Keg for reliable, good food. This location is terrific.",4
"Excellent value and enjoyable overall, as always. Experience was marred by the following:

(1) Many out-of-stock wine bottles, without their being properly marked as such on the menu.
(2) Imperfectly prepared beef Wellington. Admittedly very hard to do well, but perhaps ought not be offered then.
(3) Server was not great. Could use additional training and coaching, especially in social interaction.",1
The service was excellent and the food was cooked to perfection.  I just don't think the value is there.  It won't stop me from going for a special night/event but would go more often if it wasn't so expensive.,3
"We arrived at 8...all ready with phone w reservation for 815 open for reception...were well received and within 5 minutes taken to nice table for 2....Simon was our host...friendly...
knowledgable...got our wine quickly...took our entree...n kept in touch all evening...great job...steaks perfect...we did Blue Jays game earlier...was great spot to end our day n will come again when we r in town.",4
The steaks were really dry and chewy. It was a peppercorn steak. Really disappointing,1
The table we sat at was beside the blinds that leads to the patio. The blinds were very disgusting. They haven't been cleaned in a very very long time. Besides that the rest of the experience was great. Our server Emma was amazing!!!!!,3
Always consistent quality. Good and enjoyable. Good service,4
"I can always rely on the keg for a really good meal, and as we were eating after a baseball game even at 10:30 pm it did not disappoint.",3
Thank you so much for making our anniversary so special!! We enjoyed all our food and Heather was amazing!! We will definitely be back!,4
Food was great. It was just fairly noisy to start as we were sat near the bar.,4
Birthday with family.,3
"I find this keg is so inconsistent with food quality. 
Good service sitting at the bar",2
A very good experience. Has Keg made it across the Atlantic to the UK?,4
"The service was wonderful, the food was fantastic!! Can't ask for much more.",4
Recommended by a friend. We love steaks and have had the best. You are now the best we've had. The waiter Patrick was fantastic,4
Had a flavourful meal at the Keg. All was excellent except my twice baked potato was cold in the middle. The Caesar salad was top notch and the prime rib was exceptional.,3
"Experience was incredible from start to finish. We had champagne handed to us while we waited for our table as we were a little early for our reservation. We had an excellent waiter who was very friendly and attentive! The food was amazing, the best steaks we‚Äôve ever had by far. Drinks were great and dessert was excellent as well!",4
"Top-notch customer service from our server and our meals were served hot and tasted absolutely delicious! We highly recommend the Keg, as the Keg never  disappoints!!!",4
Ordered a new york strip loin medium rare.  Must have been this particular cut as the streak was extremely tough and chewy like it had a tendon or vein embedded in the meat.  First time ive ever experienced at the keg in my 30 times at this location.  Only ate half.   My 2 friends ordered the same cut and their steak was fine.   Disappointed with this particular experience.   I expressed my concern with the server but nothing was done.,2
Great service and the food was amazing. Atmosphere was 10/10 as well,4
Food was great as was the service. Erin was fantastic.,4
Love the keg. Food is consistent and service is usually great.,4
"So we birh ordered a 6 Oz sirloin steak. Mine medium; my date's medium rare. We couldn't tell the difference between the two. A small matter but worth noting.
The Ceasar Salad was way too small even for lunch and was poorly prepared. 
The server was excellent. Attentive but not intrusive. She apologized several times for my drink not arriving until my meal was almost finished. Not her fault.
We were seated in a initially quiet table but once the large table next to us became occupied the noise level rose to unacceptable levels at our table and we had to leave.",4
We were seated in the back of the restaurant. Our waiter seemed to forget about us once we had ordered our food.,2
"Overall, still a fantastic and classic place.  The food and service (Kevin) were great, and The Keg never disappoints.",4
"Excellent food. After travelling in Canada and so much fast food everywhere, finally we found here. Ate 2 nights on trot.
Not cheap, but you get what you pay for. Top class",4
"Excellent service, excellent food, good wine-pairing. Best dinner of our 8-day visit in Canada.",4
Thank you for taking care of my guest. I love recommending your restaurant every time someone asks me for a good steak house. the keg is always a must!,4
"Both steak and prime rib were cooked perfectly, mashed potatoes were delectible.",4
"As always The Keg never fails to deliver. Good, service and atmosphere was terrific!",4
"Always a good experience at the keg. Good prices, great service and no timed seating so you can enjoy time with your friends/family without worrying you‚Äôll have to leave within a 2hr time frame. I would def recommend!",4
Just the best prime rib of beef ! The horseradish is also quite exceptional.,3
One of us had his birthday and thoughtfully the restaurant provided a very good cake with a candle,3
Service and food fell well short of what I‚Äôve been accustomed to at the Keg. This important business lunch was overshadowed by an apathetic server and a kitchen that was comfortable with plating cold food.  Not at all what i expected from the Keg.  My lunch guest was as surprised as I was - and equally disappointed. They suggested we try the local food court next time so that we enjoy a better dining experience. Oh well.,0
"Table located in a quiet area as requested.
Service excellent
Food, as always, excellent

will be returning without doubt",4
"Ate here for lunch... this was the only Keg open for Lunch and I guess the TIFF peoples filled the place.   
 Food was good and our server Nicole was attentive.  I would eat here again.",3
Nice dinner!!! Our first stop in Toronto as newlyweds!!,4
"Once again, the service was impeccable and the food was outstanding.  The steaks were perfectly cooked, and the sides were delicious.",4
I left the Waitress a 10 dollar tip and she was Unappreciative And did not say thank you I think that was really rude but overall the food was great,0
"Went for my birthday. Good food, great service. And I got a birthday discount. Very nice start to our night. Will definitely come back to this location.",4
Very goodÔºÅReally like the steak and the environmentÔºÅ,3
Good food. We had Steak and Lobster and some cocktails. Excellent friendly service. Good downtown location.,4
"We had a wonderful time at the Keg. The patio is beautiful and spaced very well. Our waitstaff (we has more than one as we changed tables and there was a shift change) were fantastic- friendly, professional and went out of their way to make sure we had a great time. 

The French onion soup was awesome!",4
I ordered 6 oz steak and it was kind of tough.  It need to be improved.   We also had shrimp and iceberg salad and it was good.  Service was good as well,3
"I wish I could give them zero stars. Couple days ago, I was looking for a ‚Äúgood‚Äù restaurant to celebrate my 4th anniversary with my wife and I decided to opt for this place because I thought they ‚Äúwould be the backdrop for my celebration‚Äù as they advertise on their Instagram. I reserved a table for 2 at 165 York Street St location and on the special requirements section, I specified a dessert with the words ‚ÄúHappy 4th Anniversary, I love you‚Äù to be brought to our table at the end of our dinner. It was a very simple requirement and I did it specifically because of this post. When we arrived there, the hostess told us we didn‚Äôt have a reservation so I had to show them an email with all the details to expose we weren‚Äôt lying about it, which in my opinion is rude since they didn‚Äôt ask for my phone number or even email address before saying that we hadn‚Äôt done the reservation. They took a look to the reservation details (or at least that‚Äôs what I thought) and gave us a table. When my wife and I finished the dinner, I was excited expecting the dessert to give her a necklace while she was reading the phrase on her sweet course, but guess what? IT NEVER CAME TO THE TABLE EVEN WHEN I RECOMMENDED TO THEM ON MY RESERVATION DETAILS THAT THE TWO HOSTESS AND SERVER CHECKED AT LEAST TWICE BEFORE ASSIGN US A TABLE. In short, thanks to this ‚Äúwell-known‚Äù steakhouse I wasn‚Äôt able to surprise her as I wished and I was so ashamed that I couldn‚Äôt give her the necklace because she basically thought that I had forgotten our anniversary. Was it too difficult? I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE AND PLEASE DO NOT TRUST YOUR CELEBRATIONS TO THEM @thekegsteakhouse",0
"Good wine list,food always hot & cooked perfectly.",3
Great service and delicious food! We had a reservation and were seated immediately (and received a complimentary champagne upon entering),4
"Very good restaurant.  Excellent food and service, but very loud.",3
"Our meal was typically Keg, perfectly cooked, correct temperature, crispy salads, signature Keg bread and generous portion sizes. Our server was excellent, knew when to approach the table, when to top up our wine, when to serve courses and also carried on a great conversation. After all these years the Keg is still a great place for a top notch meal in a great atmosphere at a fair price. Consistently excellent.",4
"Excellent service, excellent food",4
"Our server was incredible! Top notch service. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt catch his name. But I will say: having managed several restaurants in Toronto myself, you are lucky to have him!",4
"Excellent food, amazing place!!! The service was outstanding.",4
This is a great stop before or after a Scotiabank Arena event!,3
"Our meals were delicious and the patio
provided great ambience.",4
"Celebrated my daughter‚Äôs 19th Birthday at her favourite Keg location. Our server Heather was warm, friendly and attentive!  Thank you to the manager Matthew for your help!  We will definitely be back.",4
"Enjoyed our meal immensely. Great staff, very knowledgeable and extremely helpful.  Can't wait to go back.",4
We could not have asked for more it was lovely only problem portions to big from uk thank you for making our 35th anniversary special,4
Lobster was delicious and our server was absolutely fantastic.,4
"Food is always great at the Keg , the York location is our favourite, complimentary drinks while we waited for our table . Our server was very pleasant and knowledgeable . Will always dine here :)",4
We usually go to this place for our anniversary. Food and service is always amazing.,4
"Great food, great service. A little pricey but feels like it is worth it.",4
Always a go to for my guest when I am booking reservations for them.,4
The food and the service was amazing!! Will be coming back here again!‚ù§Ô∏è,4
"The food was delicious, but it was the service that really impressed! Our server was friendly and knowledgeable and just a pleasure to interact with.",4
"The Keg on York St was a great date night location. Server was helpful all night, the patio was ample and our food was delicious and prepared quite quickly.  10/10 experience",4
Very pleasant service staff.  The roast beef sandwich was delicious and a good portion.  A little pricey but I don‚Äôt go out too often so okay every now and then.,4
"Salmon was excellent
Fillet mignon was fantastic and the garlic shrimp skewer were just out of this world",4
"2nd time at this location. Dinner was great.  Our server was new but she did a fantastic job! (Forgot her name).  

Ordered top sirloin and lobster.  Lobster tail was a lot smaller than normal.  Little disappointing.  But none the less, service was fantastic.",4
Amazing service. Did a special surprise for her for graduating and she loved it. Literally she was in tears for what I pulled off and what you guys did. All the staff were professional and exemplary. Can‚Äôt wait to back there again.,4
"We were lucky enough to be in Claire's section! CLAIRE IS FANTASTIC and makes the experience at the Keg so much better. She's knowledgeable and the menu and genuinely seems to care about the customer. Claire is top notch.

One of us has a garlic allergy and we didn't realize everything he ordered had garlic in or on it. So Claire sent the chef to discuss alternative options and prep options.

Then, evidently my steak came with peppers as an accompaniment (which I'm allergic to), and Claire got that taken care of too.",4
The food and service were excellent. Our server was very attentive.,4
"We had the best service. Our waiter was fantastic, his name was Miguel. Went above and beyond.",4
"Great food, great service! Our server Jenna was fantastic",4
"Too loud and felt isolated from the rest of the restaurant in that ally-like section .
Steaks were not as good as in the past ?
Service was great as always.",3
Service was very good. Kegs always a solid choice.,3
"Everything was just perfect - service, food, ambiance! I strongly recommend!",4
"Miguel our waiter was absolutely wonderful! He was personable friendly and professional
Food was delicious
Music was a little loud but other than that it was a lovely dining experience",4
Dined at the Toronto York St location for Hubby‚Äôs Bday.  Beautiful decor.  Attentive wait staff- delish food.  Decent pricing.  We would dine here again!,4
The drinks could be a little better prepared and with a full serving.  The food and service was good and the price fair.  A little noisey so be sure to request a table away as far as they can from the bar.,3
Amazing place with amazing food! Perfect and kind service. All as we expected,4
"Would not get the prime rib streak again, it was not warm when it was served. The New York strip Lion on the other hand was nicer and warm when it arrived at our table",1
"What a finding!! We were in Toronto just for one night and decided to try just because it was close to the hotel. Well, AMAZING, everything. Ambience, decor, service (our waitress Jessica was incredibly nice and courteous!) and most important, food! All our dishes were spectacular! Don‚Äôt miss the peppercorn sirloin or the lobster bisque. Perfection.",4
"Took my family here for lunch.  Food was great, our server Marie was sharp and attentive especially to our little boy.  We really appreciated her extra efforts.",3
The keg is consistent and worth the value. Back patio is beautiful. Service was excellent,4
My friends parents were visiting from the UK and we were celebrating her new job and mine. Staff was fantastic and the food was phenomenal.,4
"Staff was knowledgeable and could answer any questions. Good choice of drinks, the steak was cooked to perfection. Would recommend this place...",4
great to go on a rainy day..on sunny days and Blue jay days...really noisy...but rain last night so was nice and quiet. Prime Rib always a JOY!!! Great service too!,3
"Great location downtown close to the Rogers Centre and Scotiabank Arena.  My go to place for a great meal at an affordable price.  Our server, Jeremy, was efficient.  The Summer Lobster promotion was taking place and we took full advantage.  The lobster bisque was good, wish the portion was larger though.  The filet was done perfectly to my liking - medium rare, and the added lobster tail was delicious.  The dipping butter could stand to be hotter in temperature.  Overall, it was a good meal.  Would highly recommend and will definitely return.",3
"Good prime rib and  steaks. Great service.
The only negative was the escargots, while the description said they would be on button mushrooms, they omitted that they were spiced with cumin and curry. They were okay but if you‚Äôre going to change the flavor of a dish like that, say it.
Otherwise, a very enjoyable meal!",4
Brittany was absolutely awesome. Her personality makes the dining experience incredible. Can‚Äôt wait to go back,4
Amazing service and food. Our server went above and beyond.,4
"Really nice patio! Nice selection of wine. Our server was one of the best I have ever encountered dining out. She was clearly in tune with her diners; I could see she would be an asset in any workplace.
Keg...you need to bring back creamed spinach!!",4
Anniversary,4
Best steak I have had in a long time. Complements to the chef and the whole team.,4
"Amazing interior, space, comfort.  Delicious food, absolutely perfect balance in the kitchen for temps and timing.",4
"Our favorite Keg location now. Loved the patio, food and service!",4
Service was slow. Took over an hour to get escargot and a salad,2
"Great food and service !!! Every time is excellent,  desserts are amazing, hostes and the staff members always kind .
Meat and lobster always amazing.",4
"I had the 8oz  ribeye steak, cooked exactly as I liked, with garlic mash and crispy onions. Just beautiful. I enjoyed every bit. We were 7 in total and everyone enjoyed the meals they chose",4
Another great experience at the Keg! Strongly recommend,4
My steak was not what I am used to .. tough and not good‚Ä¶ my wife‚Äôs was excellent she said,2
"Everything seemed bang on until I got a Billy Miner Pie to go. It did not have any of the dark cookie crust, it was slathered with almonds and hardly any caramel or chocolate sauce! Because I got it to go, I was not able to offer feedback. 
Everything else measured up.",3
"The value and food quality was great, our server was very attentive. Food was delicious - we had salmon and prim rib, with escargot starter and creme brulee to finish. We would 100% return. We did mention our anniversary as an occasion when we booked but did not receive any special mention, however this wasn't a deal-breaker for us.",4
After theatre dining,4
"The service was very slow and we only received our drinks much after our apps showed up. 

Was never offered a second cocktail",1
"Found service to be slow and very poor. Two frozen drinks, Peach Dacharis, came completely thawed after waiting 15 to 20 minutes for the drink orders to show up.
One steak order came covered with Peppercorn sauce, not ordered, was replaced with a steak that was barely cooked.
Although they discount the bill, it was a very poor experience! 
I doubt we will ever return to this Keg.",1
"Friendly staff, good selection of food, nice plating and good food. Would recommend!",3
Awesome service great food location is excellent we really enjoyed our waitress,4
This place is  VERY dark. You need your phone flashlight to read the menu,4
Great summer menu.   Staff was extremely professional.,4
"Excellent.  Heather, our server, was very good and professional",4
"The food was fantastic. The lobster summer special was excellent, the top sirloin was cooked exactly the way I liked it, and the garlic mash was wonderful. Katie, our server, was really friendly and timely with her check-ins. Thanks for an awesome experience!",4
Always top notch,4
Giving 4 stars as they did not have my first choice wine bottle available chilled. As a result was offered another and from the second glass onward the wine was developing an after taste. I won‚Äôt do that again.,3
Everything was great except the table next to us was very loud and my friend and I had to keep leaning in to talk to each other.,4
I don‚Äôt usually take the kids to a more upscale restaurant so we were a littler nervous. Our server was amazing and went above and beyond to treat my two sons like it was a special occasion for them too. Food was amazing and the service was A++++,4
The Keg is my go to location for all of my business lunches.,4
"Was fairly busy at 8pm, a bit slow getting our food but overall the meal was awesome as usual.",4
"Service is a little slow between appetisers and main course, but it‚Äôs always a positive experience!",3
Fantastic restaurant with a very good menu - all the food was exceptional. Steaks cooked to perfection and the lobster ü¶û amazing.,4
"The keg is always reliable for an excellent meal. The prices have increased somewhat. But we were very pleased with the price for wine. Very reasonable 
Most restaurants have increased the price of wine so much that we tend not to attend these places or else to forego ordering wine",4
"The Keg never fails. We're running a few minutes late and called to let them know. No issues whatsoever! 
Food was delicious!",4
Incredible food and amazing service. Atmosphere is relaxed and enjoyable.,4
The waiter was wonderful! He was very attentive and great to chat with. The outdoor patio was absolutely stunning! We will definitely go back!,4
Good food and service is excellent. Highly recommend this place,4
Thank you Ivette and Nicole for your kind gesture making my meal right.  Appreciate it!,4
Standard Keg food - good steak etc. We asked about the size of appetisers as I can never remember from place to place. Server was good and good food. A lovely buzz about the place.,3
"-
-no comment",4
"A solid choice every time - excellent food, great ambience, our server, John, was an exceptional ambassador for customer satisfaction.",4
"All 6 of us ordered a variety of different dishes and we all really enjoyed them. The service was great! Our waiter was friendly, helpful and prompt.",4
"Our server, Josie was excellent!  She was the perfect balance of professional, fun/engaging and outgoing.  Her service was impeccable.
Patio in the back is always nice... and perfect for our birthday celebration! 
Thank you!",3
Disappointed that no mention was made of the fact this was a special occasion (birthday) lunch - completely ignored by staff.  Very different from pre Covid experience...,3
The love are tail was very small . The sirloin was very well seasoned and it was juicy . Baked potato was delicious. Ancho Margarita and the pineapple ginger margarita,3
Waitress was very sweet and insightful.,4
"Josie was Nice, helpfull and vert efficient. Thank you!",4
Dinner was great and reservation was right in time will go back to this restaurant for sure.,4
This flagship Keg is the best in the country.  Always great anytime visiting Toronto.,4
"we are from the UK and it was insane, the food was lovely and the staff were so nice!",4
"Always Perfect, this location is one of my favourites",4
"Allergy attentive Thank you 
Talia- friendly waitress",4
"Just enough choice. Cooked well, didn‚Äôt have to wait to long.",4
Service was very slow.  Considering the majority of customers during the day for lunch are on their lunch hour - hard to make it in an hour.,2
Food was above average although the Cesar salad and chocolate cake was not great. Overall good experience,3
We had a great meal.  We were early for our reservation and the fit us in.,4
Service was very poor in the outdoor section.,3
Great Food and service. Clean down town Toronto restaurant short walk to Rogers Centre.,4
Highly recommend this location! The food and service was terrific!,4
"We love The Keg and have been very happy until yesterday.
The stakes were so tough, hard to eat, lots of fat and cartilage, that was not New York stake.
The vegetables were two rounds of zucchini and 3 pieces of pepper...what was that.......
First time very disappointed with the food, even with the stake knife was so hard to cut the meat.",2
"Usual quality, ambiance and experience 
EXCEPT over 45 minutes from time lunch order placed until it was delivered- other guests ordered AFTER us received their meals and were finishing before ours arrived 
No one has 45 minutes to wait for two salads and one steak - especially at Lunch 
Dined at this location many times
This clearly lost order in the kitchen unusual - an isolated and rare problem 
Will most certainly return and would still highly recommend",1
"Our server was excellent! She was attentive, knowledgeable, and personable, always smiling!",4
Wonderful! The set up on patio is very private and oozy.,4
I ordered escargot and a bloody Caesar keg size and the waitress came back with my escargot and a Caesar salad. Then she came back with a regular bloody Caesar drink instead of the keg size drink. I finally got my keg size  bloody Caesar when I was ready for my wine with my steak and lobster. I ordered a medium rare steak which was rare and the lobster was undercooked. I never had a smelly undercooked lobster in my life let me tell you it‚Äôs enough to end your appetite. The manager was good enough to remove the steak and lobster from my bill.,2
Great food and first-rate service in nice surroundings.,3
"Stacey was our server and she was just so amazing. Always checking up on us. We never had to wait for a drink or anything. She made our night super special. Great location and ambiance, will return next time we're in Toronto!",4
Had an issue with my order but the waitress resolved it smoothly and professionally. Thanks,4
"Pre show dinner was fantastic, probably best Keg meal ever and there have been many! Literally hundreds over many years. Service from Miguel was excellent, even the young lady who seated us was super friendly. Our steak and Prime Rib were cooked perfectly. Thanks!",4
"Food was very good and prepared on a timely basis. I would say the music was extremely loud, more like a disco environment instead of a dining destination. We left before we could order desert and a second glass of wine.",3
"My partner and I love The Keg. We recently visited for his birthday and it started off great. The service was good even though our server got sat 3 tables in a row- so they were very busy. My meal was superb, I would have liked to take left overs home and shouldn‚Äôt have assumed they would pack it up for me- but I wasn‚Äôt offered a to go box either. My partners steak was over cooked but didn‚Äôt know until after we were asked how our meals were. We also weren‚Äôt asked if we were celebrating anything; we selected the ‚ÄòBirthday‚Äô option when making our reservation but nothing came of it. Compared to other locations in Toronto our experience was not the best. Our server was great though, I think they were just busy!",3
"Returned to the Keg to celebrate my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday and was disappointed he didn‚Äôt get the traditional birthday dessert. Oh well. Guess they don‚Äôt do it anymore.

Steaks were good, new menu was confusing for we weren‚Äôt served salads with our steaks/ I guess had to say the Keg classic dinner for our order. Oh well. Still love the warm bread.",3
"This location has been outstanding on two occasions in the past month when it comes to accommodating a difficult allergy. Because of their professionalism and focus on making us feel welcome and ensuring our comfort despite the extra work our allergy creates, we will continue to return.",4
The food and atmosphere was fantastic! They seated a large table (11) with our server and after we were an afterthought. Waited a considerable amount of time after main course and again after dessert. Would definitely visit again just based on ambiance and food!,4
"Another awesome experience at the Keg! From the hostess to our server Suzanna, everyone was amazing! Management must really take their time to pick the best of the best staff in the industry. The Keg never disappoints.
Our meals were also top notch! Delicious in every way! Thank you to the kitchen staff as well. The ones we never get to see but are truly just as important.
All in all, we had a great evening!
Thank you!",4
Very accommodating and generous. Service was great,4
Great service great food,4
Our server was very attentive and frequently checked in to make sure that everything was ok. The food was okay but seemed to have declined since the last time we were there.,3
"Wonderful experience, great tasting food, large portions, reasonably priced, efficient and friendly service, beautiful ambience. A delightful experience and wonderful neighborhood gem.",4
Service and food very good. Met with campaigne at the door which was nice. Only down side was the homeless man stretched out on sidewalk at the front door.,3
The chicken was amazing!,4
"Food was amazing as always!
First time having the Greens salad and we will have it again. 
Great service and overall experience.",4
This was probably our 20th time at a Keg throughout the province.  It is always great food and service.   We have never been disappointed.,4
Always a great experience at this Keg!,4
"Great service and food, fantastic patio.  We will be back.",4
"It was DELISH!!! SERVICE was AWESOME, Garrett was great!!!",4
"Steaks cooked to perfection!  Meat was tender and exactly what we needed to start off our dinner/theatre night.  Our server, Ashlyn was personable and provided us with everything we needed without being intrusive.  The Keg delivers an excellent evening every time.",4
"Everything went great as usual, only thing I wished were different which isnt a big deal really - but when I ordered my my cocktail I was offered to double it ‚Äúkeg size‚Äù it and I said yes. It came in the same glass size as the regular one and was told it‚Äôs just double the alcohol, I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten that If I knew. This is my favourite cocktail there and I think it has perfect proportions between alcohol, and other flavours in the drink, not too strong not too sweet (guava mule). Once the alcohol was doubled but the rest of the ingredients weren‚Äôt, the taste of the drink became bitter and not as great as the original. Just something to think about. I thought keg size meant double everything 

Thanks!",4
It was great,4
It was a lovely meal.  My dining companion enjoyed her selections from the Lobster Summer menu.  I enjoyed my Filet Mignon Classic Dinner.,4
Most of the food was very good. Bacon wrapped scallops were delicious. Filet with seafood bernaise was very good.  My sirloin was over cooked though requested medium well. (Wasnt best cut of sirloin that I've ever had. )  Outdoor patio is very nice.  Servers were friendly and helpful.  Would recommend and would go back.,3
Amazing as always!,4
"My request for a booth was granted. Our waiter was wonderful & very friendly yet professional.
Our food was fantastic, steak & shrimp and my salmon. Calamari wasn't great though.
Our overall experience was great & looking forward to eating here soon.
Thank you!
Anna",3
So great that as a vegan I can join my family for dinner at the keg.,4
"Our server Matt at the York St. location was friendly, attentive and so sweet! The keg has never disappointed us yet.",4
Food was excellent all items were brought out at perfect intervals.  Server was very well versed in his menue items he recommended something new they were working on so we ordered it it was good but not to our favorites we spoke to culinary manager when he came around & suggested to bring back the oyster starters. Recommended this location 5 star thank you for a wonderful experience to our show night of Juliet. Keep up the great service cheers,4
My sirloin was cooked too well done when ordered Chicago or Pittsburgh which requires charred outside and cool red center. I ate it and when I asked how I enjoyed it I told them that it was too well done. They were extremely apologetic and offered another one which I did not need. They took it off the bill and said they would have done that regardless of whether I had taken the second steak. Waitstaff was excellent as was manager,3
Excellent meal. Excellent drinks. Excellent service. Very enjoyable evening.,4
"We enjoyed the food and friendly professional service.  When the bills were presented the Keg told us our first round of drinks was free, due to the Rogers outage, which was unexpected and very nice of them. 

I really feel they went above and beyond to ensure our girls‚Äô Happy Hour get together was a success.",4
Always enjoy our visit to this Keg. Service and food are excellent.,4
My Steak was undercooked from how I ordered. Ordered medium well & came medium to medium rare.,2
"Loved the food, the escargots were to die for, the filter mignon wrapped in bacon was super as also the Peppercorn NY strip, although it was encrusted with a little too much peppercorns. Both steaks were perfectly cooked as ordered. The grilled lobster with drawn butter was outstandingly delicious. The service by Brittany, our waitress was friendly and outstanding and overall we had a great evening on our anniversary night.",4
Amazing service and wonderful food!,4
Horribl le lunch service took 40 hr for food to arrive who has time to wait that long over a business lunch. Steak horrendous untrimmed fat.,0
10/10!!!!! The experience was absolutely amazing. The staff took care of us and we felt like we were in great hands. I would 100000% go back. Prices were amazing. Food was even better!!,4
"Highly recommended, excellent service and food. Will go back again",4
Great meal & fantastic staff,4
"As a visitor from England we were highly impressed with the quality of our steaks (if only we could get that at home)
The service from Johnathan was very friendly and professional.

Thanks for a great evening",4
"Good is excellent, friendly helpful server
Difficult customers sat behind us and were catered to and treated very well, staff willing to do everything they could to accommodate",3
"Great atmosphere, food, and staff. Miguel was really friendly and helpful, and the rest of the team made accommodations for us",4
Always a great place it never disappoints us! Great food and service at the right price,4
"It was a good time and service was good, however the food was not great considering the price. It was pretty bland and cold when received at the table. I know it‚Äôs a chain and my expectations were not high. Staff were gracious to accommodate our late arrival and patio seating.",2
"Booked this location instead of the Keg Mansion by mistake, but it worked out wonderfully-everything was perfect!",4
"Good was good and cooked exactly the way we wanted. Drinks were amazing.
The dining room can be quite loud, and the service was quite slow (we didn‚Äôt time it, but I‚Äôd say it took over 45 mins to get our dinner and we didn‚Äôt order any appetizers); though they get a little bit of a pass because I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre short staffed just like everyone else (though, it didn‚Äôt necessarily seem like it was). Dinner and dessert took just over two hours (which would have been fine, but we had theatre tickets so had to be out of there at a certain time) and when we notified the server that we were starting to have to rush, unfortunately the bill and payment still took a fairly long time.",3
"We sat down and weren‚Äôt greeted by a server for about 10 mins. Placed our full order at that moment. And didn‚Äôt receive our entrees for 50 mins. 

Our server kept an eye on the kitchen but in the end we only ate only half our dinner and left in a rush for our show.",1
"Food, as always, was perfect. Service was very prompt and friendly. Made for a very good experience.",4
good food .. quick service .. excellent value. Enjoy.,4
"Great spot this is the second time this year we ate at this particular Keg. Got in on time (we had a reservation) food was great, staff was great, overall it was a good evening both times.",4
Service was awesome. Good excellent!!  Great night.,4
John brorrie (sp) was amazing.  Very professional and contentious.  We were at the keg for our anniversary and service provided was exceptional.  We had a great time thanks to the excellent customer service.  We will be back soon !!!,4
Service and outdoor patio was excellent. Food is always consistent. Friendly relaxing atmosphere,4
Great service. Very attentive,4
"The Keg is always a safe choice with my family. There is something for everyone on the menu.  It was great having a meal with my two adult children in a restaurant for the first time in over two years.  The bonus for me with this location was the outdoor patio.  The food was very good, prepared as requested and good service.  It was very quiet allowing us to catch up the news.",3
The service was great! An the food was even better! Definitely will be going back!,4
Wonderful place for a few quick appetizers and a mojito,3
We ordered the lobster dinner which was stated to come with rice and grilled vegetables. The first thing our server asked was which sides would we like to order. He dismissed the fact that our meal included sides. Upselling is a problem here.,2
"Our server Jeremy was great, very courteous and quick. He apologized for  the steak that was late, and to be honest it wasn‚Äôt even late at all. Overall amazing experience and great service. Would recommend to anyone visiting Toronto!!‚Äô",4
Always consistent and I do like the steak!  Salads and vegetables are weak.,3
Dinner was lovely! Service was wonderful. It was a great way to celebrate my birthday!,4
Good value for the high quality food that we had.  Was crowded but made reservation online beforehand so not too bad a wait.,4
Food was prepared perfectly. A wonderful Keg experience. Jonathan our server was excellent.,4
Great food and Austin was an awesome server!!,4
I want to commend the keg on the great service my sister has a nut and shellfish allergy and when she ordered the salmon they took it very seriously. The manager came out to talk to her and let her know it was being handled specially for her the chef came and delivered her food to avoid cross contamination we were very impressed,4
Very enjoyable. Great food. A tiny bit cold but our waiter did speak to management about sorting it.,3
"Great bar staff, delicious food, very friendly servers, this place is A+++",4
Great food and service.  We had a wonderful night celebrating my daughter‚Äôs birthday.,4
"My favourite Keg location. Phenomenal food, good ambience as well as friendly and welcoming staff. Prices are very affordable. Hope to be back soon!",4
"We can always count on the keg for great food, a lively but laid back ambience. We sat on the patio and the music was just the right volume, background but audible, so we could talk in normal voices without yelling at each other. This is one of our 'go to' places in Toronto when we're not looking for a gastric adventure and just want some perfectly prepared,  tasty sustenance.",4
"Our reservation wasn‚Äôt ready 8:30 
The one girl thought that we were a walk in, we told her that we had a reservation but she still suggested that we should sit in the lounge. To eat 
I asked why should we sit in the lounge if we reserve the dining room?
They ended up correcting it eventually
This server and the meal was great
We give Katie 10/10
Danny",4
Steaks were over cooked. They need to take the time like pre pandemic days to cook steaks as ordered.,3
"Great evening! Brittany was our server and she was friendly, knowledgeable and very efficient ! Thanks",4
"Very disorganized front desk and an overall poor experience.  

The ladies seemed more interested in standing around then seating their guests.  Also, in the reservation I made online, as well as, when I checked in at the hostess station, I had asked for a table with lots of space as we are just starting to come back out to restaurants from the pandemic and I was more comfortable with a bit more space.  Our reservation was for 5:15 and the restaurant was mostly empty however, the hostess proceeded to take us to a table in the tunnel style hallway with the low ceiling which couldn't have been further from my request.  Its not a good start when your hostess isn't listening......  Not sure what was the purpose of making the request in the reservation since it didn't appear that anyone looked at my request or cared to listen to my request.  We were also celebrating the end of school with our kids and not once did anyone ask if there was anything special that we were celebrating.  I even put this is my reservation but nothing.  I guess the Keg has given up on actually talking and engaging with their guests.  Our server was new but very nice and professional (thankfully); however, she had to leave our table to help another waitress with a large group that proceeded to crowd around us.  It seemed that everyone was very concerned with  filling the restaurant but not with the customers that were already there.   At the end of the meal we got the check and I asked if my daughter who was having a kids meal was going to be offered her ice cream.  We were promptly told that I needed to make the request earlier because the restaurant was running low on ice cream - really.....  In short for close to $250 and one of our first experiences eating out in a restaurant since the pandemic the Keg managed to severely disappoint us.",1
Great service and delicious gluten free meals. Recommend the Danny Ocean cocktail.,4
"Keg Steakhouse - York Street is a welcoming restaurant.  Our first visit was excellent! Food, drinks and service was excellent.  Thank you for making our first visit to Toronto special.",4

Always good...service was excellent...they came out when we said there where food allergies to understand completely.....we very much appreciated that,4
Teriyaki classic and salmon special.  Both were very good.   Server Suzanne was super friendly and attentive.  Excellent server.,4
"quieter table (as requested)

excellent service and food as usual, very reliable",4
Safe and delicious food for a family of celiacs! Recommend the filet mignon.,4
The flaw in our experience was that our main course arrived within 30 secondes of our appetiser. We asked that the food not be served that fast. When it was time for our second course our meal that we were served before were returned to us over done and dry.,3
"I have been to The KEG on various occasions, this was a first for my birthday and manage to be sharing this time with my daughter, what very wonderful dinner. Having fantastic ambiance, great service and fantastic food, set the evening from the start to finish as perfection.

Thank you!",4
"Amazing food, service, vibe and atmosphere. Hats off to our server Matt and manager Jen! Thank you for a wonderful night.",4
Miguel was very knowledgeable of the menu selections and recommendations were on point. Will definitely be back God's willing.,3
Service was fast and the server was more than pleasant. Food was excellent as usual,4
"The server took 20 minutes to bring me a beer when I arrived and then pushed us through the whole meal to speed up our dinner.  Steak and salad were good. The cheesecake dessert was disappointing, the sauce on it some kind of cherry syrup.",3
Amazing zzzzzzzzzzxxxxxxxxxxxxxcccccccccxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,4
"Conveniently located near the Sheraton Hotel & Four Seasons Performing Arts Centre. Nice ambience inside. Had prime rib & teriyaki steak, both very good. Our server, Heather, was excellent.",4
Simply sensational! Food was good and far exceeded expectations. Miguel our server had service unparalleled to any other we have had in the past. We will definitely be back next time we are in Toronto.,4
Steak and lobster tale delicious couldn‚Äôt fault it . Miguel the waiter was brilliant,4
Server was excellent. Food was prepared to order. Good experience.,4
"Timing between clearing table after the starters, serving wine and serving mains was terrible, I'm expecting so much more of such establishment",1
Great place for special occasions. Food very flavorful and wonderful service.,4
"First time eating here. The decor was lovely, service was courteous, attentive and great. I asked for crisp fries and that's what I got - delish.
My only disappointment was the steak. It was juice and very tender, but pale, soft and flabby. 
I expected a nicely charred exterior, so was disappointed with the cooking method.
In future I will specify my preference.
Will definitely return as we had an enjoyable evening.",3
"Good food 
The service was a bit slow but overall good experience",4
"As expected, the food was delicious and the service was terrific.  My friend and I have never been disappointed in choosing The Keg.",4
"The food is usually consistently great at this location, especially the filet mignon, but some veggies were burnt this time. The service at this location is usually good, but I think they may be understaffed this time.  We waited almost 15 minutes before we got seated; there were plenty of tables. Most of the time we couldn‚Äôt see our server, we waited a while to ask for dessert and to get our bill.  By the time our billy miner pie came, it was starting to melt.  Coffee came after the pie was almost finished and was melting.",3
An overall good experience. The server coughed into her sleeve at one point. And NY strip was much less thick than previously.,3
"This was our third time visiting this location during the past few years and it was again a great experience. The service and food were perfect and as it was my birthday we received an Ice Cream cake which was a delight.

My only complaint was the row we were sitting. it was like a long corridor and the way sittings were arranged everyone was in a very close range and if you wanted to go to washrooms it needed special maneuvering.

Other than that it was a great experience and this location stays my most favorite.",4
"Our server was amazing, so efficient as we were all tight for time and super pleasant.  He expedited all of our orders and our meals were fantastic too!",4
One of the best fine dining experience. Loved the food and the presentation.,4
We were attended by Susan who treated us like family.,4

"Excellent service and delicious food we never tried this restaurant in Montreal where we live,and we are charmed!We are definitely goin to put it in our list when we go back home ! 
Thanks to our waitress for being so kind and well informed about the menu she patiently explained to us our choices. Very elegant and trendy place we where able to have a conversation without raising our voice !

The Keg consistently offers great service and delicious food. We had some food allergies at our table and the staff went above and beyond to make sure everyone's needs were met.,4
"Good food, great service.    Keg in general needs more lighting,  all locations are a dark.",3
Had Miguel as our server and he was outstanding!,4
Convenient to the Four Seasons Performance Arts Centre,4
"My wife and I have been to the Keg many times over our 40+ years together. We usually think of the Keg as a nice place with ""ok"" food and slightly overdone steaks. This time we were blown away. Everything from the welcome to the delivery of the bill was superlative. Steaks medium rare were just that. The dinner set up our evening out perfectly",4
Service was wonderful but food was lacking. The sweet potatoes were not even cooked and broccoli tasted like frozen vegetables and mushrooms very very salty. Did not mention it to server bc didn‚Äôt want to sound like a complainer but for the price I paid for the classic meal I think the side accompaniments should of been better.,3
We enjoyed the food the service and that they provided our dessert for our 30th anniversary. It was very nice,4
Great new with an old friend The Keg has a great reputation and they didn‚Äôt let us down.,3
Great place to celebrate an anniversary. Awesome food and vibes!,4

"It was a great experience, can‚Äôt go wrong with the York Keg",4
"The Keg never disappoints!
My wife loves it, the Keg closest to our home was booked so we ended up at the one in the financial district.
It was fabulous",3
"The restaurant was quite busy, as usual on weekends. All the food was prepared well and our server was friendly and efficient. One of us tried the ""throwback"" steak special (topped with cheese) and decided the current mains are better.",3
Service and food is always consistent and impeccable!!,4
Great service and food as always! It was my kids' first time at the Keg and they loved it so much! Thank you :),4
"Always love the Keg, I dine out regularly and some folks are put off by it being a chain, but their food, service and atmosphere is always top notch.",4
Fantastic wait staff. Food fantastic,4
I ordered medium for my steak but it was rare. Not a showstopper but would have preferred at least medium rare,4
I am a huge fan of The Keg. Been over a hundred times and never had a bad experience. The food and service is always excellent.,4
"As always, food and service was top knotch. We experienced some communication glitches with ordering appetizers on time which resulted in both our appie and our meals arriving overlapping. Staff didn‚Äôt seem to be talking to one another as about 4 people tried to serve our table.",2
"Great experience! Awesome food!
Definitely will be back.",4
Happy 50Th anniversary The Keg. We had so much fun and the 50th anniversary menu. Our server Heather was wonderful. She made we were enjoying ourselves. She recommended the signature dessert Billy miner pie. Yummy. We will never forget this wonderful evening.,4
"We had a great start with a bottle of wine and we noticed everyone but us getting their meal except us. We made the server aware and she obviously forgot us bathe meal did arrive rushed, half burnt and overall garbage. I made the server aware of me frustration and a manager finally came over and acknowledged the major issue. Not impressed and will newer return for dinner.",0
Service was fine. Food quality and taste was really lacking.,1
We had a great lunch with our customer.  Thank you for the great service and meal!,4
Food was great...service was really good but way too loud of a large party near us when we were on a 2 person night out !,3
"It was a very enjoyable experience and the food was amazing as expected! 

Thank you!",4
Attentive friendly service. Well prepared dishes at a reasonable price.,4
The food is always excellent and the staff is very friendly.  It is pricy but you are getting high-quality food.  It is very loud so it is not the place you would go for a quiet conversation. You go there for the great food.,3
"It was a great experience at the Keg.  Food was great, service was great and overall atmosphere was great.   The Keg also made my daughter‚Äôs birthday special by bringing her out a yummy sundae with a candle!",4

Thanks to all once again. Will be back as always ü§ó",4
"Very thorough with food intolerances and waiters were very knowledgeable of the menu! Fantastic food but there was a bit of a wait for the table and it took around an hour to get the food. Would have been 5 stars if service had been a little quicker. Overall great atmosphere, fantastic menu and excellent staff.",3
Sirloin Oscar was delicious as always! The appetizers were delicious as always also,4

Great service and food,4
"The Keg never disappoints. We enjoyed their 50th anniversary dishes, our favourite starters, and some wine from their list of great choices. Steaks were perfectly cooked and appetizers were delicious as usual. Service here is very accommodating and friendly. The Friday night crowd created a great atmosphere without being intrusive.",4
When I made the reservation through Open Table I added that it was our anniversary. No mention was made on arrival or during our dinner.  I was hoping for a candle in our dessert or something. It was our 40th wedding anniversary. Also my husband‚Äôs meal should have come with mushrooms which never appeared. Otherwise the food was wonderful and so was the service.,4
"We are from the states and just being tourist. Meal was great very good wine and service satisfactory. I‚Äôd recommend except it‚Äôs a chain. We were looking for local, but still good!",3
Excellent as always.  You can't lose at the keg. I'll be back.,4

We went for my boyfriends birthday. They have him a free piece of cake! Great night,4
"The food was even more delicious than I had remembered and anticipated. Hosts were welcoming, server was attentive.",4
The vegetables served with the steak were and awful selection. It was basically one asparagus spear and a bunch of whole cherry tomatoes and some strange mini chopped sweet potato cubes that had zero flavour. Likely from a frozen bag. Not consistent with the usual keg experience. First time in almost 15 years I was disappointed.,2
"nothing to complain, we joked around and our waitress kept up with us which was terrific. some table don't joke the same yet she was very professional with each tables we seen her at.   the food excellent as well as the service and food.",4
Excellent service and food quality.,4
It was very nice. Food was quite tasty.,3
We want to thank Jenna for an excellent service!,4
Kurt at the bar runs a great experience!  Friendly greeters & hostess.,4

Not the best Keg i've ever been to but decent.  Would go there again.,3
Our server Patrick was wonderful!,4
"This is a ""go to"" restaurant for me. Always consistent and delicious. Staff is considerate, efficient and friendly.  A good place for casual or business lunches. Steaks never disappoint",4
My and husband and I have celebrated our wedding anniversaries and other special events at the Keg in Kingston. We were celebrating my retirement at the Keg in Toronto and disappointed we didn't receive complimentary desert as we always do in Kingston.,3
"Was there for a business lunch with 3 other colleagues. Service was fantastic and our server was ""just the right amount of attentive""!",3

Our server was attentive, patient, made us feel welcome and actually conversed with us. Alyssa was amazing and even the hostess was extremely welcoming. Thank you so much!",4
Overall very good experience. Short pre game meal,4
"The service was great, the food was good. I would go back again and would recommend the keg york location to friends and family",3
The food was good and the service was excellent. The thing that spoiled my business lunch was when a table right next to us was seated with about a dozen people. The noise level was so bad that my guest and I could no longer communicate and asked that our table be moved; our waiter complied willingly and promptly so I could continue my meeting. You should have a separate room for large parties like that as they dirrupt everyone else's experience.,2
Service was excellent and the food was delicious.  Would highly recommend it.,3
Good food and atmosphere,4
Great experience and amazing food.,4
Server was great getting seated with a reservation was terrible hostess was rude and purposely ignored us and seated us at a dirty table we waited 25 mins before getting a server and our table cleaned,3

"Good service, good food.. Effective reservation, pleasant hosts...",3
Great night out! Food was delicious and we enjoyed the setting.,4
"I used to Eat at the keg every time i come toronto, the food was very good 

My steak FILLET MAGNON  i asked to be cooked in a medium. It came medium well . But i asked to be changed , The manger came and changed , but i was already full from the appetisers. So i couldn't enjoy my piece like every time. 
The manger didn't even make sny compensation.  He just changed the piece

Note . The waitress Stephen was very very professional.",3
It was my husband‚Äôs birthday.  Thank you for making it special.   Heather our server was outstanding.  Excellent service and food.  Everyone was friendly.   My favourite location.   Hope to return soon.,3

"Our server Steven (Table 8) made the evening. He was attentive but not intrusive. He watched over the table but wasn‚Äôt always approaching us. Empty water was refilled quickly. He was polite and friendly. My daughter barely ate her dinner and he offered to keep it in the fridge all packed up for us to retrieve later. Because we weren‚Äôt able to take it with us. Very considerate. The food was exceptional as always!!!!!
Thank you for a super evening!",4
You always know what you are getting at the Keg....great Food at a reasonable cost,3
I had a great time for my birthday! The creme br√ªl√©e was delicious!,4
"From the moment we walked in we were taken well care of. Champagne offered to us while we waited to be seated was a nice treat, then having a window seat was even better. I‚Äôll say the noise level in there was a little much but can‚Äôt do anything about that on a Friday night with being in the financial district and people from the suburbs coming to town for the night. Have yo say our waitress was phenomenal and took great care of us. The food was exquisite as one would expect from The Keg although slightly sad they discontinued the Crab Parmesan Spinach Dip from the appetizer choices. But overall a fantastic time none the less and since everything is about location in Toronto this particular location is one to recommend should you ever be in downtown Toronto looking for a great place to dine before/after an event!",4
"Perfect for a date, for a pre-show or celebratory meal, or anytime that steak and seafood, Billy Minor Cake, freshly cooked bread, or the best escargots in garlic are what the soul craves for.",4

Great staff and food was perfect. Washrooms were clean.,4
Waitress was absolutely outstanding! Service was quite fast and overall very good,3
"Food was good however our waitress had a difficult evening.  We waited  a long time for our initial cocktails.  We waited to place our food order , the wine we ordered was wrong and came after we had finished our meals.  With that said the manager removed an over cooked steak from our bill, removed the two glasses of wine that arrived too late and offered a free dessert.  Not our usual experience @ The Keg",2
"Great night‚Ä¶.right from walking into the restaurant,the attention to customer service was outstanding.The Champagne was was a fantastic welcome and the hostesses were attentive,friendly with smiling faces.Our waiter and wait staff were over and above while the food was classic Keg delicious and prepared to perfection.Cant say enough about our amazing experience,it had been ages since we went out for dinner and we were not disappointed ‚Ä¶that‚Äôs an understatement‚Ä¶.Thankyou for making our dinner out very special.",4

The server was so friendly. The ambiance was great!,4
Fantastic service. My girlfriend's steak was a little overcooked and they quickly were able to bring out a beautifully cooked replacement. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. Food was delicious as always. Thank you!,4
"Will not order the lettuce wraps again, ever.  Why call them wraps if they aren't wrapped?  I suppose I should have asked more questions.   Seemed self explanatory.  Server quipped that ""I guess they want you to work for it"" - cute but not helpful.  That's why I pay for someone to make the food.

Service was very good, all staff were very friendly and helpful.

Food is generally very consistent.  My friends steak was cooked perfectly.",3
Great birthday celebration and service ‚Ä¶,4
Always great at the keg! Any location !Great Staff!Great speak!,4

"It was a wedding lunch, the waiter offered a free dessert for the bride and groom yet the cost was on the bill",3
"We usually go to your King & Portland  location but my cousin came in from Waterloo and stayed at the Royal York.
So York  was closer .  our reservation was for 7pm on Sunday so it was somewhat busy not full and we are a party of four adults.
We ordered crispy cauliflower and scallop appetizers . the cauliflower came but the waiter said our scallops somehow went to another table hmmm.
I ordered the prime rib 14oz and my cousin ordered the 10oz.When my plate arrived I thought it looked small & I asked the server - is this the 14oz ?? reply yes.
My prime rib this time was ok but not as tasty as King St  I noticed it had a lot more fat - but didn‚Äôt say anything just my own thoughts. 
As we were finishing our meal I usually take some home but not this time & when I looked over at my cousins cut as he was boxing it up it was much thicker than mine -  so it finally dawned on me that the 14oz was on his plate not mine .
Obviously I‚Äôm not going to say anything about this to our guests - but when diners order the same item but different sizes - obviously a mistake happened 
The kitchen made the mistake .
When the waitress put my order in front of me - I asked is this a 14oz ? & was told - YES - 
Since we were treating our guests - this was awkward as he obviously got my steak on his plate.
Which was an obvious plating mistake in the kitchen 
We usually go to the King St location when it‚Äôs not busy so the attention to the food prep is very different than York.
My cousins wife is vegetarian but I requested the Keg hoping she would like something on the menu and luckily the cauliflower and gnocchi did it for her so maybe you have a new customer in the Waterloo location.
My final thoughts are you haven‚Äôt lost me yet ‚Äî I do enjoy the 14oz Prime rib but I will keep my business @
King St. If I choose to return

It was amazing got to spend the best day of my life there and it was perfect,4
Excellent as always!,4
"We were there for a friend‚Äôs birthday. Food was great as always, and the server was professional too!",4
It was so nice to be back and enjoy the open bar area. We have continued to support the Keg throughout the pandemic but last night felt more normal. Food and service was as excellent as ever.,4
We had to wait an hour to receive out appetizers and as we had a show after our dinner we had to skip our main because it took so long.,1
"Food was incredible, the restaurant was BUSY, but the service was exceptional!  Loved the ambience and overall experience!",4
Excellent quality and value always at the Keg. We will keep coming back. This particular location was a bit tight and very loud. It was difficult to hear the conversation at my own table. I would suggest a little more attention to table placement and groups placements.,4
"The restaurant was amazing. They had kids coloring books/crayons out as I said 2 of the 6 were kids. The food was delicious as it always is at the keg. 
We love coming here and eating. 
Thankyou",4
"The service was mediocre this time around. Not exactly what I'm used to from the Keg. The restaurant was very busy and the waitress wasn't very attentive.  But, the food was amazing as usual. Will probably visit on a not so busy night.",1
"This was a great weekend away for my husband, myself and our granddaughter.  This was her first time dining at the Keg and for a 7 year old quite a big deal.  We all enjoyed our meal especially her as she gobbled up her steak with yummy noises lol.  She also enjoyed her tasty smoothie.  All in all was a great experience and a beautiful memory for all of us to treasure.

Thank you

Sue Amsbury",4
"Overall the experience is good. The food is delicious, the waitress is nice, the food is quick and the price is acceptable. If I can be told the sparkling water has extra charge, it will be perfect!",3
"Server did not seem to be checking on us with any regularity or even in the vicinity so that you could flag her down if you wanted something. Result was long waits looking for server. 
She seemed to have assessed early on,  here is a family and  therefore this won't be a large bill and thus I will spend less time focused on them. Disappointing considering I ordered a $22 glass of wine which should have sent a different message as to type of customer at the table.
I ordered a steak rare and to showed up Blue, it was tasty so I ate it but she never showed up to check on our meals until we were more than half done.",2
"Very good place, great food, fantastic services, a bit noisy - later one... the whole Keg was full... which is a good think for you, guys...
thanks

"Veggie meatloaf too salty, everything else was great. Free ice cream cake for the birthday person",4
Thank you for the delicious food and the service. Everything was perfect.,4
We had a great experience at the Keg on York - our server was attentive and pleasant and we had a quiet little booth for two that seemed secluded from the rest of the diners. The food was quick and delicious. Definitely recommend this location of the Keg.,4
This keg restaurant is perfect for a business meeting.,4
We had 4 adults and 4 kids and the staff did a great job with the kids so the parents could enjoy themselves too!,4
One of the best Keg Restaurants we have eaten at. Our server was fantastic and the food was excellent.,4
Waiter was excellent! Very friendly and great food and service.,4
"Guaranteed good meal, absolutely delicious! Great atmosphere, service and energy.",4
I was forgotten by the hostess. When taken to my table the hostess did not bring a menu. The meal was great. Waited 10 minutes after I was finished my meal before a waitress came to speak with me.,1
"We hadn‚Äôt been to The Keg in a few years, and it was SO nice to be back. We sat in the lounge and Deanna was our server. She was so attentive and friendly. Both of our meals were delicious. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!",4
Overall great experience.   It was our anniversary and they really went out of there way to make it special.  Our server was really great.,4
Fabulous food and service!  A perfect night out!,4
"Great experience in everyday.  The food, service, atmosphere and price is top notch.",4
Great service and food as usual at the Keg. I‚Äôve never had a bad experience at any of their locations,4
Very nice for a beginning of an evening at The Scotia Bank Arena,4
Nice to see it crowded! First time in years (COVID)!,3
"My order of a steak sandwich was strangely delayed, server said something about the cook not being happy with the original piece so another one was prepared.  We waited a very long time for our order, diners at a nearby table who arrived after us received their food first.  When the steak sandwich finally arrived, there was quite a bit of gristle on it.",2
Lovely evening celebrating the women in my life. it was everything one could ask for. the service was outstanding!,4
"Always good value, food was excellent, servers were friendly, prompt,  and courteous

Will be back",4
"Service was great, food was delicious as expected!",4
We have been here before and it has been excellent. This time the service was slow and we couldn‚Äôt even get the waiters attention for another drink. If this had happened the first time we wouldn‚Äôt have bothered to return.,2
"Consistently tasting food at all locations, and was exactly what we were looking for.",3
Great food and better service.  Awesome spot to get together with friends.,4
Good food. A little pricey for what you get. Felt a little rushed to eat and get out. Not much time to enjoy and relax between appetizers and main course.,3
We had a ladies night and really enjoyed our dinner. Our server was attentive and made sure we got our food quickly and that we were happy with our meal. He was kind enough to let us gabby girls stay extra long. Thank you for a perfect evening to catch up with friends and we look forward to visiting again real soon.,4
"After a rough start, (*our group got lost in the foyer scramble) the staff at the Keg more than made up for our prolonged wait. We were comped a beverage in the bar area and seated at our convenience thereafter.  They were very apologetic and kind in acknowledging their oversight. All table service was excellent. Food was high quality and the pace was just right. Can't wait to return.",4
Service was fantastic.   Friendly and helpful and the food was perfect,4
Always a great night out at The Keg never disappointed!,4
Overall experience was great. Great food and service was great. Hospitality from manager was greatly appreciated.,4
Great customer service,4
"Great food and service! 
Steak was cooked perfectly.  We will be back!",4
It took 20 minutes for someone to greet us at our table. We had to draw the attention of the manager who was quite apologetic and offered us a round of free drinks. It took a long time to get our meals and our table was seldom cleared of empty dishes. Our food was not what we are used to at The Keg. I can honestly say I had never had a bad meal at The Keg before last night which was extremely disappointing. It was our first time in the city since pre- Covid so felt letdown by our experience.,2
It is my favorite Keg. Manager makes me and my wife feel like personal guests,4
"Delicious as usual, steak cooked perfectly once again!",4
Great service and good food. The food was tasty and great!,4
We absolutely loved our evening at the Keg's. The food was delicious and the service was outstanding!,4
Fabulous everything and Yian (spelling may be wrong) was totally exceptional!!!!! Thx team abs can‚Äôt wait to be back!,4
"Had a lovel dinner celebrating two birthdays!
The staff were kind and accommodating.

Thank you",3
Very pleasant experience celebrating a good friend's birthday.,4
"Awesome food and service, thanks!",4
"Was an overall good dinner, but the food seemed like it had been left under a heat lamp for a bit longer than I would like.",3
Celebrating a new job.,4
Great service! Excellent vegetarian meatloaf.,4
Great server! Made our eve! Always a fab happy hour and specials!,3
"I did an online search while planning my trip to Toronto and stumbled across The Keg Steakhouse. From the minute my guests and I walked in until the moment we left, I have never felt more welcomed in a restaurant. Besides from great service, every drink and bite that we had were truly top tier. Management came by to check on us and they even threw in a birthday dessert. I have never been completely satisfied at a restaurant until dining at this establishment. Cheers!",4
As always FANTASTIC. It was unusually quiet on a Friday at lunchtime. Come On folks let's get out and dine at our super spots!,4
Great dinner and good service,4
"Steaks were amazing ~ veggies done to perfection, Miguel was a friendly, and knowledgeable delight, manager check in on our satisfaction, food was freshly prepared, not a long wait for it either. front door hosts were friendly and seating us quickly as we had reservations,",4
Consistently delicious with wonderful wait staff. And always meets or exceeds my expectations!,4
"I forgot our server‚Äôs name, but he was outstanding. Prompt, courteous, friendly, and knowledgeable. Food was fantastic as usual. All around stellar experience.",4
"Always the best.
First time at this location and it was very nice.
The parking is the the only issue but it was only $12 after7pm
Will come again for the amazing service and food.",4
"10/10- great food, service and experience",4
No matter which Keg I go to its always been a great experience !!,4

Overall good experience,2

Great location with exceptional service. Used to frequent the Mansion and Leslie location but I have made this my new go to.,4
"Heather our server, was  meticulous about our orders and very thoughtful about needs. Food comes a little too quickly, a feeling of being rushed through my dinner makes it hard to enjoy thoroughly because it‚Äôs such a great meal! We‚Äôll be back!",3
Amazing as always. The service was excellent she was so friendly and very approachable. Food was so good.  Steak cooked to perfection.,4
Extremely delicious and our server Emma was absolutely amazing! So pleasant !,4
Excellent value for great service and delicious food.,3
"Good service and safe food for even severe celiacs, lots of options.",4
Belated Christmas gift card!,4
"As the first dining In experience for the year, we were fortunate to have a cheerful and attentive server. Our food arrived in a timely manner. My 6oz was cooked to my requirements and had great flavour but for some strange reason was tough. This was not the chef‚Äôs fault. I would have been perfectly happy with just a new steak since everything else was amazing.
Instead, the server and the manager brought me a whole new order. This time it was ‚Äúmelt in your mouth‚Äù. 
My boyfriend‚Äôs prime rib was delicious.

Thank you for a wonderful evening.",4
"Great decor and ambience, excellent service, good food! Appropriate for business or personal dining.",3
"WE HAD A GREAT EVENING AT THE KEG ON YORK ST, DOWNTOWN TORONTO. WE WERE A TABLE OF 4 (1 CHILD AND 3 ADULTS). OUR SERVER WAS PATRICK. HE WAS SUPER FRIENDLY ANVERY ATTENTIVE. WE WERE CELEBRATING A BELATED BDAY AND HE WAS SO KIND TO BRING US A SLICE OF YOUR FAMOUR BILLIE MINER PIE! THE EVENING WAS FANTASTIC! THANK YOU PATRICK AND THE KEG FOR ANOTHER MEMORABLE NIGHT OUT!",4
Our server Patrick was very nice and professional. The food and environment were great too!,4
"We had a great experience, Paul was so nice with us, he‚Äôs great!!! He went above and beyond to make our evening really nice! Thank you!!!",4
"Alyssa was wonderful! We had a lovely dinner and the food was so good, as always!",4
Was very good. I got the filet and would recommend to anyone trying,4
"Excellent  food. EXCELLENT  service 
What more  puld you ask for",4
Celebration,4
"Amazing experience, might have to come back again",4
Birthday was wonderful,4
Dinner at the Keg was excellent as usual. Miss the Asiago Rice though!,3
"Amazing staff here. I had an older guy chatting me up at the bar and the staff stopped me on the way to the washroom to talk and make sure I was okay. Nice to see the staff looking out for their guests. Food and drinks were great, as always!",4
Service was outstanding. Friendly and professional.,4
Great bar and restaurant   Friendly and efficent service,4
"Great service, food was hot and cooked great",4
"The staff was friendly, the service was great and the food was delicious.",4
The place was really cold. We told the waitress  about it but nothing changed,3
"Now that the Keg has reopened, everyone is excited to be amongst other people! The staff and servers were very friendly and welcoming. Of course the freshness and quality of the food was excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and will be back.",4
"Katie was a fantastic waitress! Delicious food, as always. Clean and nice ambiance.",4
Service and ambiance great.  Funny but half the food on my plate (vegetables) were cold?  Never had this before.,3
"Excellent service, excellent food and drink.  Excellent value for money.",4
We‚Äôre all still just opening up. So there weren‚Äôt a lot of people but everyone was cheerful and the service was excellent.,4
Messed up steak twice. I ordered Medium. Standard order .  First it was rare and then they fixed it and it was well done. On top of it there was total miscommunication by the manager. Totally ruined the evening. Server was the only bright spot of the evening.,0
Food was great as always. Stephen was very kind and attentive to us. Happy to be back.,4
Our waiter Chase was fantastic and fun. Took very good care of us.,4
"Celebrated my birthday and the service was amazing. 
My waitress made sure we were 100% satisfied and she was very friendly I loved her uplifting personality,
Will definitely be back as soon as we‚Äôre allowed indoor dining again :)",4
"The food was excellent from the very beginning to the very end.  I also want to thank the staff, the ladies were absolutely wonderful from checking me in, to having the general manager approach me about my concern about a seating area, to the server.  They are rockstars.  Thank you and I will continue to visit this establishment when I visit this city in the future!  Well done!",4
Great service and amazing food! The keg never disappoints!,4
"Always consistent food and service. Our server Chase was very professional, attentive and gave us quality checks that was not bothersome. Will always come back.",4
The perfect dinner! Everything was delicious. Beautiful place.,4
"Our server was fantastic.   This was our first visit at this location and service was better than expected!  Food was great as expected. 

Thank you for the wonderful service and we'll be back.",4
"Excelente comida, porciones grandes. El sabor exquisito y el servicio fenomenal",4
Please see private note.,1
"We love the Keg for so many decades now, one of our favorite places.The food is delicious, the service is great and the ambiance perfect! Always consistent never disappoints. Good job, well done üíñüëèüíñ!",4
Server was great. Filet minion and my strip is what we got. Amazing,4
Great meal and atmosphere!,4
"everything was outstandingly good! the waiter was very kind and helpful, the food was delicious and filling, the whole restaurant looked elegant and expensive, nevertheless the prices were affordable. would go there again!",4
"We really enjoyed going to this location for dinner. The service was fantastic, and the food was delicious.",4
The restaurant did not follow the provincial guidelines of having no more than 50% capacity.   The restaurant was packed by 7:30 pm.  There was only a few table and a few seats open.  The restaurant has a capacity of 350 but there was close to 300 clients in the restaurant.,2
"The service was good, friendly waiter. Food was good, albeit a very small amount of mash! Overall, the dining experience was good.",3
Meat was fine. Sides where way over cooked and barely anything on a 45$ plate. Have made much better at home,2
"We actually dined two nights in a row this week. We were so impressed the first night we decided to come right back. Had the prime rib both nights and it was incredible. Lovely wine selections, great service timing. The kitchen really killed it. Salome in the lounge served us both times - she was attentive, detailed, and kind. She‚Äôs a fabulous server and you‚Äôre lucky to have her.",4
Everything was great but steaks were very overcooked.,2
We had the escargot and the french onion soup for starters and both were very good.  The server was fantastic. The issue we had was with the main course. We had the 14oz prime rib and the steak wasn't seasoned properly. Parts of it was really salty. Also I had the twice baked potato and it was borderline burnt. Other than that we had no issues with the overall experience.,2
Great venue with new menu choices made this a wonderful experience time and time again.,4
Steaks were very good. Lobster not so good.,4
"upon arrival was greeted warmly, covid protical was followed to a tea, did not have to wait long for table, hostess that seated us was extremly courtious . Waiter was very good. Our dinner was presented in a timely fashion and was cooked just the way we had requested. Only draw back is the noise level. Too high. Overall was a pleasant evening.",3
"Service was great, steaks and prime rib were good, but the $18 lobster tail really disappointed‚Ä¶
My fault, I should have sent it back‚Ä¶
Looked like a shrimp, probably less than 1 ounce",2
Dec 27 Matt M was our server. Was an awesome Keg experience. The food is always great but this service was 5 star. Would recommend Keg - John Street.,4
Waiter was attentive but not intrusive. Food was delicious and cooked perfectly. Presentation was attractive. Price was reasonable. A lovely place to get a great meal,4
Server was excellent...attentive but not intrusive..,4
Nice and quiet dinner out. Nice and quiet dinner out.,3
"Suzanna was excellent! She explained the different cuts of steak so that we could order what was best for us. She was kind, efficient and really enjoys her role. We went to a few places on our trip and she was the best by far. Everything was cooked perfectly and taste delicious.",4
"Overall everything was excellent, however, it was a tad dark where we sat and half way through the evening they dimmed the lights even more which made it way too dark.",3
"Our server was amazing!!!

However, the greeting girl that sat as down was pretty much lied to us that she cannot give us a booth because there were other parties coming. It was 9 pm and with the Ontario Legislation and the restaurant half full it was an obvious lie...",4
Both food and server are excellent,4
"We ordered three steaks and all three were over salted. Vegetables had no seasoning, carrot tasted like frozen out of a bag and broccoli was on the raw side. Mashed and baked potato were good, highlight of the meal. Our $30-45 steaks tasted worse than what I can make at home for $15. Not worth the $150 before tip. Service and ambiance are great though. The manager offered to remake the steaks but it took an hour from when we seated to when the food arrived so we declined and left. Past experiences were better so expectations were higher. Booked a few weeks in advance and was a disappointing Christmas eve dinner, we won't be going back anytime soon.",1
"Christmas Eve dinner. Our steaks were perfectly cooked. Our waiter was a lovely person, but perhaps a bit lacking in the more refined aspects of the job. The ambience was warm and felt special. Our one quibble would be the crowding in the foyer. It seemed like everyone (including us) had a reservation, but there was a fair bit of waiting to be seated. It made us feel a bit uneasy due to Covid.",3
They were short staffed and at 50% capacity and they nailed it! Great time!,4
"Great food. Amazing cocktails, very friendly and kind stuff. üòÑ",4
"Service was great, especially Mitch! Food was delicious, we had a great night out!",4
"Good lunch, bery dependable roast beef‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ xxx.",4
Absolutely incredible experience and cannot wait to return!,4
Simply the best.,4
SLAM DUNK - bartenders (Ryan and Kurt?) WERE AMAZING,4
"Nice modern decor, great service and food",3
"We had some issues with food quality, spoiled lettuce in our salad, butter for lobster served after our meals came, and menu choices not available.",2
Great service and food was delicious as usual!  We would highly recommend this location.,4
Christmas party,4
Awesome food and awesome service - Keg does not disappoint,4
"HUGELY DISAPPOINTED!!!
I had a table for 8 booked. Arrived and the place was closed!!!! Not even a call to let us know.. my girlfriends birthday was ruined as we had nowhere to go!!!",0
"After travelling 30+ mins to get to the restaurant, we found it closed by the health authority - even though we had to confirm the reservation, they obviously didn‚Äôt feel obligated to tell us they were close",0
It was closed,0
"Everything went well. Good good, good service but a bit slow.",3
Good food with quick and friendly service. Our waiter Mitchell was great.,4
Love this location of The Keg. Best service and food is exceptional!,4
"Great steak and salad, sizzling prawns awesome. Waitress was lovely",3
The service was fantastic and the food was very very good. All in all we had a great lunch.,4
We booked a table for 8:00pm. We arrived on time but had to wait another 20 minutes before we got our table. Good service. A bit over priced.,2
"The Keg never disappoints! I will argue they have the best prime rib in the city, and for value you can't compare, prices are half those of the high end steak houses but the quality is great. Plus they have them beat on apps and cocktails.",4
"Great ambiance and service.  
Roast Beef special was uncharacteristically under cooked.  
Other steaks were fine.  

It is not an easy time for restaurants.",2
"Great as always , a little too loud in the dining section but overall always a pleasure.",4
"From the moment we walked in the door to the moment we left, everything was absolutely perfect. If I had to make one comment it would be that although you cannot control the volume of people talking, the music might‚Äôve been a wee bit loud. But I wasn‚Äôt offended by it. I will return as soon as I can. We celebrated our 27th wedding anniversary and our server acknowledged it very nicely.",4
"Emma did great as our server. Timely, professional, friendly.",4
Enjoyed our meal very much and I would return again.,3
The food was delicious and the service was excellent.  My friend & I both enjoyed the meal and the location.,4
"My prime rib dinner, which I‚Äôve had many times and is usually great, was subpar. I‚Äôm calling to complain. My table spent $300.00-Three ladies ( all agreed food was lacking) and we deserved better. Service was excellent though. I won‚Äôt go back for food.",2
Always reliable and good food. A classic meal.,3
"Ordered the Chicken wraps for lunch the lettuce was old and brown there was a total of 10 tiny chicken pieces 
Overpriced and terrible 
Very disappointing as this was my first bad experience at a Keg",1
"You guys closed your doors on Monday and made 0 attempt to contact me. I was taking a client out to dinner and your lack of contact resulted in me looking like a fool, trying to find another spot 

Really do not think customers should be served that way",0
"Main dish excellent. The fried calamari entre were very dry and below standard. Service excellent, I would suggest toning down the loud rock & roll music in the dining room section. A more quiet music is more appropriate for this section.",3
"My steak was cooked so well everything came out hot and super delicious. Our waitress was amazing and on top of everything we needed, I love coming to this location on York St. It was my birthday and I ordered the mini brownie and the waitress came out with a candle on it which was so nice and appreciated made me feel special like part of the Keg family. I also had a strawberry daiquiri which I get every time I come and the bartender always makes it so amazing and delicious. Keep up the great work and I will be back again and I recommend this location to friends and family all the time.",4
Work event,4
"The only complaint I would have is that our table wasn't ready - I think we waited 15 minutes. The free champagne was nice but there should be non-alcoholic options - one of our friends doesn't drink. 

Thanks",3
"Our waiter was Paul and he was absolutely a joy to have. He was knowledgeable, extremely genuine and exceeded every expectation. Food was completely flawless and we loved the sparkling wine at the door, very nice touch. We are already planning our next visit.",4
"Great Food, Great service.  So nice to go to a restaurant, tables were set and we had a menu to view.",4
Our server Katy was awesome! She made our dinner fantastic,4
"The meal was absolutely delicious!!!!  Our server Miguel, was very personable and professional. We will be back.",4
"the overhaul diner event was excellent.  Our waiter (cannot remember his name unfortunatly) was excellent.  Their when you needed him, very pleasant and professional...with a litlle humour as one likes.  The food was excellent (Prime Rib) as always.  The embiance was very nice, clean and pleasant decor.",4
I really enjoyed our experience at the York street Keg.  Food was of great quality and the server was amazing (I think his name was Hein).    Highly recommend and plan to be back!,4
Awesome experience as always.  Bar and wait staff were great! Food and drinks did not disappoint,4
"I have been coming to the Keg for years. My client's love it and the food is  always excellent. 

Larry",4
The Keg on York Street is my go to spot to take a client for lunch that has good food and a professional atmosphere. The service is always solid and attentive.,3
The waiter was amiable and attent.  Thanks for a great lunch.  We will come back for more.,4
Service was horrible. Sucks because the food was ammmmazing. Ladies at the bar need a vacation,2
Todo excelente !!,4
"After bring away from the Keg for 1.5 years due to the global pandemic, the Keg was my go to for a dinner out. Exceptional! They did not disappoint.",4
"Was my bday, and the entry staff did all they could to spoil the mood. We weren‚Äôt allowed to go in bcoz we couldn‚Äôt show an email vaccine proof for our 13yo son. I had the email proof for me n my wife but couldn‚Äôt find the email for our son as i probably deleted it by mistake. I showed them photos of us at the pharmacy receiving our (both) shots and his health card with photo to show that it was actually him. But they said it wasn‚Äôt enough. I asked for the manager and it took more than 30mins for her to show up. she came i explained the situation to her she said there‚Äôs nothing they can do. That we can‚Äôt go in if we don‚Äôt show the email or vaccine certificate for our son. After some moments of leaving us at the entry, she came back and asked that i pull the details from the ON vaccine site it was already about 45 mins of waiting. I did pull our (all 3 of us) vaccine details from the ON site and then they let us in. At this point my mood was already ruined. It was a terrible experience with the front staff who had ZERO flexibility or tolerance. I‚Äôm left to only wonder if that‚Äôs the way they maltreat every family with a kid who‚Äôs vaccinated but can‚Äôt find the email proof even after providing every other detail to suggest the kid is vaccinated.",1
Only issue was a family with 3 kids running along the seats for about 1/2 hour until the manager asked the parents to have the kids stop which they partially did. It was lovely when they left. They should have told them to go to Chuck-e-cheese,3
"Great service, excellent food and very attentive staff.",4
"Outstanding food and service, can't be beat.  Excellent value for money.",4
"Came from the states for fianc√©s birthday and picked the keg for our birthday dinner. The whole experience here was amazing ! 10-10
Thank you",4
"Ordered my steak medium rare and got it medium to well done. An unusual mistake for the Keg and I didn't send it back because I didn't want to disrupt my dinner with my guest, but  next time I will.",3
Fantastic. Always a great meal with excellent service,4
It was our server‚Äôs first night at this location and he was superb!,4
"Very good service.  Nice ambience, a bit dark where we were. Tasty food. My filet was not done properly, but the fixed that promptly. I was surprised when the filet was comp‚Äôd. Not expecting that.",4
The  Keg rarely disappoints and the steaks are always cooked exactly the way one orders them.,4
Heather was an amazing server! Food was excellent......,4
Great experience and vibe. This is one of the nicer locations of this chain. Staff is very friendly and our steaks were perfect. We will definitely go back to this location again.,4
The service and atmosphere were great and the food was amazing!,4
I had the Keg sized prime rib with a baked potato loaded.  The prime rib was cooked to perfection.  I got what I paid for and then some.  A truly enjoyable experience.,4
"We were celebrating a deal closing with clients and could not have been happier with every part of the experience:

- Reservation was on time, no delays, with a perfect table.
- We had pre-ordered champagne to be served as soon as all were seated and the server executed perfectly and demonstrated a high level of attention to detail and etiquette (served ladies first, topped up as appropriate, never in the way).
- Timing of the meal delivery between appetizers and mains was flawless with the right amount of time between courses.
- Food quality was excellent and consistent (as usual).
- Prompt attention to presentation of the bill and settling ensured a smooth and efficient exit with no interruption in conversation or delays.",4
"Food was delicious as always. After serving everything on time, our server took a long time to come to our table to give us the bill and even after we get the bill we had to wait longer than ideal to pay.",3
Great staff and food,4
My party had a great time.  Food was great and the wine selection met our needs.  Would definitely go back more often once working in the office is the new normal.,4
"Since the reopening, it has been our experience that some restaurants have really struggled to retain expert and affable staff. Not The Keg! This was our 20th anniversary dinner and we couldn‚Äôt have been treated finer. We very much enjoy the Keg‚Äîthe caesars, the consistency and quality of the food, the great value‚Äîand this dinner reinforced our elevated view of this fine restaurant brand. We always look forward to a return trip for guaranteed good times and great food!",4
"The meat was perfect. Tender, Juicy, Tasty, Great Quality.  Thank You. We had a Great Time",2
It was good to back.  The quality of the food is always at the same superb level - I especially like the grilled vegetables!!!,4
The server was very attentive and friendly. My NY Striploin was cooked just right and tasty .  I would come back again,4
"Service was amazing! Food was good!!
Great evening!",4
"Great service, had a great experience. Would definitely recommend",4

Highly recommend. Amazing experience from start to finish.",4
We went there for my sisters birthday. We were welcomed at the door and seated quickly. Our server was super nice and very helpful! We will definitely be back.,4
Service was excellent all around. The food was good and reasonably plentiful. The ambience is noisy but the physicality of the restaurant adds resonance beyond any one's control. The entire dinner event for we 8 was very satisfactory.  We will be back!,4
Always a reliably good night out. Service was a little slow and they crammed all the tables into one section which with COVID is a little disappointing. Our server was lovely & excellent with my companion‚Äôs many dining restrictions.,3
Very good food and service. The steak by far is the good to at the Keg.,4
"A good experience overall.  Would have liked if the cloakroom had been open.  Coffee was warm, not hot.  Main course arrived before salad was finished.  But overall, an enjoyable evening.  Wasn't rushed.",3
Our server was wonderful. He knew when to approach and when to let us be. His menu knowledge was spot on. A great server makes for a great night out. Thank you.,4
"The service was good. The starter and entree outstanding. The desert was not  really on par with the rest of the quality. The icecream was simple and the cherrysauce came from a supermarkey quality bottle. As a steakhouse however, the Keg delivers excellent meat.",3
Top notch as usual.  You know what you get when you eat at the Keg!,4
I have been coming to this Keg location for many years and the service and food are consistently outstanding. The atmosphere is very pleasant and it is one of my favorite places to go for dinner.,4
Our waiter was amazing. Food was amazing. Resturant was amazing. 5 stars all around.,4
"Always a good solid choice. Good food , good service, Good value.
You know what you are getting when you walk in the door",3
Great service,4
Great dining,4
"Consistent quality, solid service, great value.    Always a top shelf experience.",4
"The food was great, but the waitress was better!  Great service and a smile and positive attitude!  You should give her a raise!",4
Best place to celebrate my birthday with family. Excellent food is consistently good.,4
Service was great and the food was excellent. Thank you,4
"I have a violent reaction to dairy. We communicated this to the waiter, and the allergy was accommodated at every level. Coordinate between the waiter, the manager, and the kitchen staff allowed me to eat without concern of cross-contamination; which is a pleasant change to my usual experience dining out.",4
"We hadn‚Äôt been to TO for over 2 years. We have 2 teenage daughter and the evening was lovely! Great food, great service and a fun evening!",4
Our waiter Matt was very efficient and made the evening more enjoyable.,4
"Our server Joe was amazing the food came out hot especially rare when you have a group of 10. Whomever, is the grill master my ribeye was cooked to perfection. The team made my brother-in-law engagement a successful night.",4
Anniversary,4
Always dependable.,2
Miguel was amazing!,4
Great as usual. However I was surprised that the keg is not scanning vaccine QR codes.  Makes check in easier,4
"the steak and lobster was dry. the presentation of my dish was no effort put into at all, too many vegetables, i didnt know it already came with veg on the side the waiter could have told me so i can order another side",1
"Food is usually consistent and steaks are made exactly as ordered. For some reason they could not get it right this time. Our medium rare steak first came well done, they took it back, no questions asked. Unfortunately brought it back rare, did not bother to ask for another.
Off night for a typically good restaurant.",3
Just amazing.Service and best steaks ever.Service was so special.,4
Decent menu.  A bit pricey for lunch. Lucky to have had a very good server.,3
"Amazing experience definitely,  it was my 9th anniversary with my husband and I wanted something special for him so we visited The Keg , delicious food and good environment üíï we can't wait to go back for his birthday üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà thank you guys ‚ù§",4
"Excellent, excellent food,  would go there again and again",4
Our server was very attentive. The host accommodated an extra person at our table. Thankful for the great service.,4
The Cod Oscar with Cauliflower Mash was amazing. A mild easy taste with perfect blend. Who would have thought at the Keg! Mini creme brule was perfect for a small conscious desert.,4
"I always enjoy my lunches at this Keg location.  I'm always greeted by friendly faces at the front and of course my star bartender, Lilly, who is a wonderful server and a joy to be around.  But on Nov. 3rd they all made it extra special for me as it was my birthday!  They went above and beyond for me and I was very touched - it made my whole day.  I really appreciate my Keg Family and love them to the moon and back too!!!",4
Prime rib was done to perfection with a really nice Pinot Noir.,4
great service very polite crew,4
Great meal and great service.,4
"This is the best Keg, consistent and delicious",4
"Excellent service and a delicious meal, as always!",4
"Had an amazing time, the food itself is worth going for but our waiter Miguel made the evening that much better! Was very attentive, great conversation, personable, and always made sure everything was to our liking.",4
Great food and great service,4
Having significant items on the menu not available isn‚Äôt ideal. Especially with a small menu. Not acceptable at all,0
"Did not know they ID children, wasn‚Äôt impressed as we got their with our reservation, sat at in the back corner, very crowded, couldn‚Äôt here my server front desk manager was funny said he do something for my husband‚Äôs birthday but didn‚Äôt even come back!  Never had a Birthday for my husband at the keg poor experience for us and I know it was because we were BLACK",1
Watermelon cosmo is to die for it‚Äôs the only reason I go there lol,4
Excellent food and service.,4
Service and mananagement is excellent. Screening was thoughtful and professionally done,3
"A beautifully laid out and arranged space provided a very comfortable and relaxing evening.  As with my other experiences with the reliable franchise, the food was of high quality and very reasonably priced and the staff was exceptionally attentive and courteous while still being friendly and familiar (in the most positive sense).  And that was one damn fine, exceptionally dry house special martini.",4
Ate here the week before and it was outstanding. Seemed to be an issue with the delivery of food to tables on this second visit. Plates had clearly been under a lamp for a little too long. Not reflective of my first experience dining here,2
"Had a great meal before a Raptor game. Had a reservation, table was available on time. Staff were great, food was hot, delicious, and cooked as requested. Had a great meal!!",4
I got the filet mignon and the meat was outstanding. Service was excellent and we were very well taken care off.,4
Food was excellent. Service was great. Top notch.,4
It was my husband‚Äôs birthday. The staff was great and helped to make it a really nice celebration.,4
"Every fan expo held in Toronto bring my daughter and I to Toronto. We have been doing this trip for the past 5 or so years ( not including COVID years ) we have always stayed at the Sheraton. This past year we stayed closer to the event but still made our way to the York street location. It has never disappointed. The service we received this past visit was about two levels above exceptional. Food, drinks and a very attentive service ( Mitch I think ). It should be noted that my daughter is 23 years old and anything she wants is just what she gets. If I had to point out one thing, crab legs have been removed from the menu, I am guessing it has something to do with the retail 80 per pound price tag. We will be back next year and the year after that. Thank you for making our dinner visit nothing short of perfect.",4
"Went to this location last night, food was amazing, service was great and atmosphere was exceptional. Very helpful and safe with my food allergies.",4
Was as good as always,4
Food was great. Outstanding experience. Service staff was excellent.,4
"Burned food, I was really disappointed.
I ate because I was so hungry, nothing else.",0
Had a great time. Good service and consistent food. Management was also very helpful in assisting me with getting a homeless man a hot cup of tea.,4
Very friendly service. Food cooked perfectly.  Highly recommended,4
Jill our server in the bar was amazing! Food was delish as always,4
Hands down the best steak,4
"As always, great service from hosts, waiters and floor staff - friendly and highly proficient. 

Consistently great quality food and good sized portions.

Extra special credit to the team for respecting the request to turn the noise down to a normal level. Instead of just saying 'sure, we'll try,' they actually did try and they actually made it happen.",4
"There was a dog next to our table. Apparently it was a service dog. But it sat on the bench and put its paws onto the table. You can tell it was a pet. In addition, the dog kept staring at us which ruined the mood of the evening. The Keg is supposed to be a nice restaurant, it is fustrating that the manager approved allowing this dog in because it was not a proper service animal. It was a pet and those diners were abusing the system.",0
Food was delicious - and service was perfect - our waitress ensured we received quality service.,4
Best Keg in Toronto,4
"Our Server was exceptionally slow. Came and asked for water refills and walked off twice without taking our drink orders. 

We had to call her.",3
Lovely waitress.  Great food as usual.   It seemed slightly higher prices. But worth it.  I love the blue cheese on teriyaki steak.    Sooo good,4
"Very good food and atmosphere in a great location 
Nice staff",4
"Enjoyed my meal at the Keg , my only comment was I felt the Cod needed some kind of sauce , even Tatar , found it a little tasteless . Had the creme br√ªl√©e for dessert which was excellent . Caesar salad was good too. Will go back for sure . The server was very pleasant . We were seated in the bar area, the music was a little loud but all in all a good experience .",3
Restaurant is following COVID-19 protocols and it was a very safe environment to have lunch.,4
The experience was pleasant. Steak quality is a top notch and it was cooked to perfection. Stefano our waiter was very professional and made great recommendations. He also surprised us with a yummy dessert on the house.,4
Our server was excellent and attentive and helped create a good night,3
"Great steak, good service and lots of fresh vegetables on the plate. Didn‚Äôt leave hungry, even with an 8 oz Serloin Oscar.",3
Always a fantastic experience at the Key. Sierra was awesome and the food was delicious. You‚Äôre never disappointed when you dine at the Keg. Thanks for making our birthday celebrations special!,4
"Great experience: top service and delicious food.
The only complain: we made a booking a month in advance asking to reserve a table with a nice view, instead we were in the back of the restaurant in a dark corner.",3
Everything was to my liking except one thing. My order was not fulfilled and when they made things right the food item was overcooked like it was sitting under a heat lamp or stuck in a microwave??,3
"We had a wonderful evening. From the Caesar salad‚Äòs to the beautiful 10 ounce fillet mignon with the twice baked potato.
We had a fantastic server who answered all of our questions with confidence and poise and everything came out hot and very very well prepared.
Also had an incredibly tasty Zinfandel wine. I am so happy that they are re-opened again",4
"The steak was unbelievable!  Tender, tasty and matched with a baked potato and grilled vegetables.  The service was spot-on,  just attentive enough without being annoying.",4
Good food. Great value. Excellent service.,4
"I really have no complaints. I take my family to the York St. Location as often as possible because of the hospitality and ambience. To context, I live in Pickering.",4
Great place to enjoy dinner before a game. Service and food is always reliable.,4
"Our seating was for 8:15.  Restaurant was moderately busy.  We were seated across from bar area to the darkest corner table for two. I mentioned to server we are walking into the darkest abyss.  My seat position was facing a huge black wall.  Not a great atmosphere to view.  Appetizer Brie dish came cold and barely heated.  We were starving being it 8:30.  I ordered lobster tails it came with asparagus that was wilted and old looking.  Disappointing.  I don‚Äôt like to complain during dinner as it throws off the whole vibe of the dining experience.  
Overall we won‚Äôt be back to this location.",1
lovely ambiance and good food.  Sat in bar area as the rest of the area was quiet.  Had to book early for 5.45 dinner as no time slots available but there were tons of empty tables when we left....so a bit disappointing that we had to go so early when there was clearly space,3
Great service from Dianna - will definitely return,4
"Service was amazing üëè
And the ice cream cake üéÇfor my wife,  
Nicely done üëçüèΩü•≥",4
"Nice setting, easy to book. 
Food is fairly good but standard.
It is great though not exceptional.",3
Another fun and fabulous meal at the Keg  Consistently good food in a fun atmosphere with great service.,4
Food was amazing as usual. Scallops were cooked nicely and our steak was cooked properly as a medium rare. Miguel was our server and did a good job. The worker at the door forgot to mention to Miguel that our dinner was a special occasion anniversary dinner. We also mentioned this on our reservation. The Keg usually gives a complimentary item for special occasions. Miguel apologized because he wasn't made aware of this detail. The experience was still good.,4
Amazing experience- wonderful friendly and professional staff (as always) and food was fantastic (as always) - COVID makes dining challenging but the Keg team made it easy to check in with proof of vax and large booths are great for ensuring safe distance. Will definitely be back- thanks so much!,4
"Great service and the steaks were very good.
Friendly water and relaxing environment.
We can recommend this steak house.",4
Thanksgiving,4
Server very good right amount of attention.  No complaints.  On any level,4
Great atmostphere service and food was great. People were friendly and helpful. My only comment is that my vegatables were very under cooked and most of them were pretty much raw and cold.. zucchini peppers and asparagus...,4
"Great Food and Service, will keep us coming back !",4
Helpful staff and very good food. Recommende the brie,4
Love this place! We‚Äôve been to several locations and the service and food quality has always been consist: just awesome!,4
"We're Keg fans for the consistency, value, and very often, reliable service. We were treated like gold by Ted, and had a great date night!",4
Their watermelon cosmo is AMAZING. Definitely a great evening had.,4
"We had a really lovely meal at the Keg last night. Our sever couldn‚Äôt have been nicer and the food was its usual excellent standard. Loved the booth we sat in too, quiet enough to chat but perfect ambience. Lovely to be back!",4
Wonderful experience at The Keg on York! Great service provided by all.,4
Great! The bartender was super helpful and nice.,4
"Had a wonderful night out with my best friend.. was able to sit on the patio on Oct 8. Amazing..
The food was to die for.
We had the best waiter.. his name was Ted. Service so good.
Just a wonderful evening",4
Steven was very attentive.,4
"I love the Keg, best food, service, ambiance, good value.",4
"Good night with good friends.  Service staff hovering because we went past our 90 minute dining window was a little unseemly, but fun was had by all.",2
"When we got to the restaurant the lady outside greeted us with great respect and nicely. Once inside the other lady took us to our table but we told her that we would prefer another table. OUCH, she was not pleased with our demand and it showed in her face. We got a table in the back of the restaurant  next to a large group!!! It is a good thing that we had a great waiter PAUL. Thanks to him.",3
"Chase, our server, was very attentive and efficient. Thanks Chase for making my friend‚Äôs birthday special!",4
The service was superb!,4
The food was great as well as the service. Suzanne who was our server was very engaging and personable.,4
"Overall the food was very good, although we found the Caesar salad disappointing. Our server was so-so - didn't check in enough, long periods of waiting. The food was rather slow in coming, especially the main course. The music was too loud and disruptive. Nice touch that they brought a special dessert in honour of my son's birthday. Spacing was good (felt safe) and they did a rigorous check in for vaccinations, which was appreciated.",2
We went for dinner on the last night of our honeymoon and we were treated exceptionally well. We were treated to a celebratory dessert. Our waiter Mitch was very attentive and great.,4
"Steak was undercooked by a degree of ‚Äúcooking‚Äù, mid rare came rare. It was very good though",4
"Our steak dinners all cooked to our preference.  It did take a little longer than expected before our entrees were served (about 45 minutes after order was placed), but it could be a result of a busy Saturday night.  Service was good, and food was great.  The only thing we found was the dining room being super dark.  It might be helpful for just a tad bit more light, or perhaps have candles to light up the room for the perfect effect.  It was too dark to even read the menu but it wasn't a big issue.
Overall a nice dinner at The Keg.",4
Waiter forgot our appetizer. We didn‚Äôt remind him as salads had already been served.,3
"The Keg is pretty consistent, no complaints on taste or way the food was cooked. Would like more veggies with my meal that‚Äôs all.",3
"Tim was very friendly and helpful for us, he made our stay comfortable and outstanding.",4
"Great service, quick and efficient friendly server.",4
Good solid experience at the Keg again. Everything was good and prepared as described‚Ä¶. Decent value for the money!,4
Tables nicely spaced indoors.  Extra delicious meal after almost 2 years away due to pandemic.,4
The Keg York St has an excellent back patio that makes dining outside a very enjoyable experience. Staff are always outstanding.,4
Amazing Service at the keg.  Server not only met but exceeded our expectations of great customer service!,4
"The food was excellent, as usual.",4
Great happy hour on patio with heaters! Loved it..thats all I can say!,4
"Way too many COVID Guidelines being interpreted into ""Keg Law"".

The quality of the Steaks appear to have been down-graded.

Service by Kurt.....Excellent !",3
Perfect as always. Visit every 3 months for work and it‚Äôs always perfect.,4
"I went for the Happy Hour. Not a lot of choices, but the food I had was very good as were the prices. Will definitely return.",3
"Had the usual steak, was great. We mentioned on our reservation that it was our 17th wedding anniversary ad we would like a great experience but we got put in a back corner and waited nearly 25 mins for a drink.",1
"Good location from our hotel on Richmond, service was timely food great, a little to dingy/ dark for my liking hard to read menu used light from my cell phone lol over all great experience though",3
"Server was great but New York steak was so tough I couldn‚Äôt eat most of it!  Server was wonderful. Offered me another one but no time.  So she didn‚Äôt charge me for it.  Great server,poor steak!",3
My steak was not as good as my previous experiences. It was not the Keg quality I am used to.,1
"Very organized given current restrictions, outstanding service, great food and lvely setting.",3
We had a great anniversary dinner - enjoyed every bite!,4
Service was amazing and meal was fantastic as always.,4
Great service‚Ä¶.delicious food‚Ä¶.quiet table for two for our special night.,4
"food is not delicious. The cod has no taste 
CHARACTERS",2
Great food and great service.,4
"Excellent food, great service and great ambience.",4
It was amazing experience. Everything was fantastic!,4
"Everything is perfect. Nice service, nice food, and mood!
but I ordered medium and medium rare for steak, both my steak is medium rare. Not a big problem, but I hope you pay more attention to grilling steak in the future!",4
"We had two waitresses, one in training but service was very slow. The plate was hotter than the potato but enjoyed ourselves. Delicious steak.",4
"Keg is always great.  Briana, our server, was amazing.  She was attentive and took great care of us.",4
We had a waiter in training. He was very polite and service was awesome.   Everyone was spaced out and and check in was quick and organized.,4
The Keg is the Keg. I find their restaurants a little on the dark side. Their food is consistent across all the Kegs I have tried.,4
"On being seated we were offered a table in the bar area with very loud music which we declined. When we go out to dine we like to have a quiet &  normal conversation and not have to yell to be heard. We were then seated at a table where the noise and music level was conducive to conversation. 

I thought loud music was discouraged during COVID.",3
Birthday ‚Ä¶..,4
Excellent service. Quality food. Will definitely return again.,4
Great service again at The Keg. Good food and the type of night we expect from this chain. Thank you!,4
"Mother in law was in town , the Keg on York st is somewhere to wow them!",4
"Our server was an absolute gem ‚Äî memorable time thanks to the amazing service! Food was so delicious, will absolutely be returning soon!",4
The food & drinks took really long to come out. Right before my food came out the server let me know that they don‚Äôt have the side I asked for and asked if I could substitute. The food came out it wasn‚Äôt goodNot happy & prob won‚Äôt be going back,1
"The Keg never fails. One of the best restaurants, great food, great prices in my opinion and a wide variety of drinks/cocktails. Had a great time sitting on the beautiful patio looking out at financial district in Toronto.",4
The Keg Toronto is a stylish and very popular steakhouse .  Food was excellent and tasteful. We did the Filet Mignon with Lobstertail. It was soft and tender and aromatic . Our server did a great job! Thank you for this wonderful evening .,4
It was my first time trying steaks.Definitely worth trying there.,3
"Food was great, but was over shadowed by the service.  Sat by the bar and watched our drinks sit ready for 10 min (almost got up to get them ourselves).  No offer for additional drinks when the food arrived so the Manager stepped in and offered to get us drinks.  Overall, not the attentive service we are used to at other locations and  did not meet the Keg standard in my opinion.  We chose the Keg for a Birthday celebration, which turned out to be the wrong choice for a place to eat.  It's unfortunate when we have to pay a hefty amount for a meal and not get the experience or value for the money.",1
The food and service were great. Thanks to our server Paul. We had a great time! Definitely will be back.,4
Not cheap but excellent food and service.  A delightful experience.,4
"Good seating inside; seating is okay outside as there is a private wall. York St is busy enough with pedestrian, cyclists, cars and weekday construction. We had a great waitperson/waitress/waiter. Food was reliable with a decent kids' menu too. It was our son's birthday dinner and The Keg gave complimentary cake for him : )",3
Anniversary,4
The prime rib is always at the  best and the special the sirlon with musheroms very good. You have to taste the calamars at the beginning. Finally a great  service with a nice smile.,4
Food was ok. My prime rib was a bit dry and not much flavour. But my sons baseball steak was good. The bacon wrapped scallops were small. It was my birthday and we did let them know. Dessert did not come with a happy Birthday wish. It was not till later the server realized or forgot. But did take dessert off bill and wish me a happy birthday after all was paid and done.   First time in 50 years they did not make one feel special as a guest.,2
"Beautiful location, expansive patio with heated lamps.  Phenomenal service by our waiter, augmented by other staff who took the time to check in.

Food was cooked exactly as requested with a great presentation.

Thoroughly enjoyed our time and will visit again.",4
"Good food, entitled service...the waiters know they are getting tipped out well and don't really care.  Our waiter was chatting with 1 guess for over 20 minutes.  We had to call another server over to bring us our bill.  He never knew we left.",2
"Val, our server, was amazing.",3
Good to have a dinner with friend and boy/girl friend,3
"The keg never disappoints, delicious and cooked on point.
Our server was very attentive and thoughtful.",4
The ambience is very good and food quality can be improved.,3
The environment and food was amazing along with the amazing service received by Stefano. We will definitely be back!,4
"Was the perfect vibes for a date, a slight bit too dark in there but other than that, the food was very enjoyable, and seating comfortable, service was exceptional as well.",3
"Love the keg for its usual consistency. Unfortunately this dinner was not the best we‚Äôve had. Both my friend and I found our steaks incredibly over seasoned. Cooked well but oddly spicy. Both of us noticed right away something was different. Very overpowering spice. One order had the wrong accompaniment but the manager brought out the right side pretty quickly so that was good. Super inefficient when arriving to the restaurant. You have one girl outside handling a group of at least 20 people minimum. She‚Äôs in charge of checking guests in, having people fill out contact tracing and then checking to make sure the forms have been filled out. All the while you have four staff standing inside the lobby while this one staff member is trying to go as quickly and efficiently as possible. She was overwhelmed and I don‚Äôt blame her. Usually would recommend the Keg- but this time left something to be desired! The experience from the beginning with our hosts, to our server who appeared to be on one of her first few shifts, to the over seasoned steak- would give it a 3/5!",2
The Keg is always consistent with service and food.   Its a great go-to for dinner or lunch.,4
Customer service incredible. Food delicious. Wonderful experience will go back,4
Birthday! Great provided a nice dessert,4
Amazing experience - excellent good and service!  Staff were wonderful!,4
"For the amount spent, food was blunt in taste.",3
"Here for a birthday, we had an amazing server ‚ÄúTed‚Äù and a lovely seat on the patio. Food was excellent as always!",4
"What an AMAZING experience.
Ryan, our server/bartender was absolutely a delight. 
He was ON POINT on everything. 
Couldn‚Äôt have enjoyed a better meal!

Management: please acknowledge Ryan for his amazing service. 

Tonight we came to check out the patio, to decide if we wanted to host my wife‚Äôs bday dinner. 
After the service we received, we made a reservation on the way out!!!",4
So great to be able to go out to dinner with friends!!   Food & service was great!,4
The server went above and beyond to make it a pleasant experience.,4
"Food was awesome, restaurant can be brighter and in terms of service, Suzanna was unbelievably amazing but the other waiters and waitresses are less friendly, I got ignored a couple times.",3
Great service and value,4
Great service by Danielle. Great food.,4
"Our waiter was a dream. Very friendly, super nice to talk to and FAST! Everything we ordered came as we ordered. I believe our waiters name was Garret. 10/10 service.",4
"Ambiance & service was great but food was just okay. The steak i got was great but the steamed veggies, cauliflower bites, and French onion soup were just okay.",2
Great location and friendly staff who were very kind and attentive.,4
It took a long time to get our main courses. The value of food and drinks was good.,3
"As usual the food was delicious as it always is at The Keg. The service was very good, warm and friendly. We had a lovely family evening there",4
"Excellent food and Service
Our waitress Kanya was excellent!",4
"Great location ,amazing food ,friendly staff, great service",4
"I came to the keg for the first time on September 4th 2021, and our server Ashlyn was absolutely amazing- Ashlyn explained the menu, was very attentive and prompt with her service and had the best customer service manner I have ever encountered at a restaurant before, especially given that this was my first time at the Keg I can definitely say I will be back especially to this location when I‚Äôm in downtown Toronto. Thank you Ashlyn for an amazing experience",4
Very good experience! Excellent food and surprisingly not as expensive as we thought it was going to be when we got our bill. It was our anniversary and they brought out a delicious piece of icecream cake that we couldn't even finish because everything else was so good. Our server was on top of everything and was great. When we went to leave we almost ran into a bunch of tables because it was so dark in the building. I'm glad we were seated  outside,3
"Even with a reservation made well in advance, it appears one must now wait a significant amount of time (~20 mins) to be seated due to Covid-19 policies. Also, there is apparently no point in making a bar reservation here. They operate on a walk-in basis for the bar despite offering a bar reservation option via OpenTable. Walk-ins who were asking for the bar were getting seated at the same time as those of us who had made a bar reservation days in advance. 

The food and service remain good, however.",2
Our server Shantel was friendly and listened to us and made every detail come out right. She was  engaging and upbeat and the food was fantastic.,4
"We went to celebrate our wedding anniversary and we had a great time at this location. Everyone was warm and welcoming and our server Miguel was very professional, attentive, knowledgeable and we were able to share some laughs with him. Overall we had a great experience and would recommend this location.",4
"great service, the staff was awesome, a very nice night out.",3
"They accommodated me before my allotted time, the patio at this location is spacious and good for social distancing. The server was very friendly and attentive and the food came out at a decent time",4
"As always, great experience! It was nice to finally be able to dine at their patio and enjoy on of my favourite steak places ‚ò∫Ô∏è",4
"Great service, the food was delicious and outside atmosphere was enjoyable!",4
"As a party of four we took issue to all of us having to take out our phones and submit a Covid screening separately.  Normally one person per party does it for everyone.
Also this was the first time in a Keg when we weren‚Äôt offered more than one piece of bread.
Other than that it was a good time.",4
Our waitress Deanna was awesome. Food was good. Patio was nice and quiet mid days.,4
Great service!  Nice to be back after COVID19 restrictions have lifted a bit.,3
"food was very poor.  shrimp starter rubber, steak frites cold and creme br√ªl√©e cold",1
Made our anniversary special by gifting us a couple of drinks! The hostess noted our occasion and well wished were also written on our receipt,4
"Sat at the wood in the patio had fantastic service from start to finish
Amazing food
Amazing patio
Amazing staff 
Highly recommend",4
Consistently excellent food in a nice atmosphere. Mood lighting gets a little dark. Do not miss the cheesecake!,4
"Food was prepared quickly and was very good, as usual. Our go-to place for dinner and are never disappointed.",4
"We has the misfortune to be seated besides a birthday party and the screaming was unbearable. Add to this your noisy music and you get the picture. 
I understand you can't control your patrons, but the music was just too loud, we asked to tone it down but did not notice a difference.",2
"Thank you very much!!! Everything was great! Food - fresh and deliciously prepared. Desert was suggested by our waitress and was sooo yummy!  All our requesters were accommodated with kindness. 

Our waitress was caring and attentive and went above and beyond. The entire experience was a blast! 

Best Keg experience ever ü¶ãüëåüèªüåπ
 
Thank you! üåπü¶ãüåπ",4
Great service. delicious food and nice patio‚Ä¶never disappoints,4
Our waiter Paul was very helpful and friendly!   Tables inside near the fireplace are quieter and  have more ambiance.,4
Worth the price! From our amazing server to the flavourful food !,4
Great service from Anna!,4
Excellent service on the patio really made the experience.,4
"First time at this location, the patio is great. Different and enjoyable vibe.",4
"Food was delicious as always, great service and atmosphere! Perfect for a night out!",4
"The service was great, our waitress was fantastic, but the steak was burnt and bland. This is the second time I have been to this location where the food has been terrible.",1
"We visited The Keg to celebrate my husband‚Äôs birthday and they did not disappoint. Danielle provided excellent service and the food was great too. She brought a complementary cake and that was the cherry on top of our wonderful experience. The only thing that could have been better was the check in process and the lighting inside the restaurant, could use better lighting but overall great experience, thank you!!",4
"The Keg York St was a beautiful restaurant we went for Anniversary the staff was friendly and welcoming . The Manager even came to make sure we where happy with everything . It was our Anniversary so we got a special dessert . We loved our meal the service and staff .we would suggest it to any of of friends family visiting Toronto . Thank you again Keg staff for making our experience so wonderful. 
Maryann& Ang",4
Brought my granddaughter to Toronto for a couple of days. Always visit this location on our trips.,4
"Amazing place to celebrate a birthday! Great food, safe environment, decent prices and friendly service.",4
As expected‚Ä¶great.,4
Great food in a cozy ambiance with superb and personalised service.,4
"This Keg is for the most part, always consistent and reliable. This time, The service was a little unorganized, and despite reservations, it didn‚Äôt seem as though the restaurant was well prepared. Rather than make people wait 45 minutes and seat people out of order, it would be helpful if they were transparent and simply explained what was happening. People would understand.  That said there is a pandemic and return to normal means baby steps. 

We both ordered the steak -med rare which is keg style. Classic keg quality!  Our server was terrific and attentive. And the dessert was a great finale. 

While the keg may be predictable, it‚Äôs a great go to place for a comfort meal!",3
A real nice prime rib dinner in Toronto COVID considered they did a good job,3
"Wasn‚Äôt happy that they couldn‚Äôt guarantee me an inside table when I booked a Standard table indoors since the weather was so hot & humid.  Twice they wanted to put us out at the patio, but my lungs cannot handle the heat.",3
You can never go wrong when choosing The Keg or this location!,4
"My group and I had a wonderful time. Our waiter Steven, was very courteous, attentive and helpful. He suggested items from the bar menu as well as food choices which were all excellent.",4
Excellent Birthday,4
Always lovely dining at the Keg!,4
Amazing 20 ounch Rib steak and ouble Lobster tail dinner for 2  including drinks was super cheap. Great value!,4
Fabulous experience - excellent food and service!,4
"Food was great, service was awesome, they accommodated my every need, overall nice chill evening out, will return.",3
Great service. Great food,3
Sara my server was amazing.,4
"!r√®s bon service! Gestionnaire au courant des plats pour une raison d‚Äôallergie, re√ßu tr√®s bonne r√©ponse. Choix s√ªr pour un steak ! On aime bien la c√¥te au jus! Tr√®s tr√®s grand restaurant et belle terrasse arri√®re.",4
"The food at Keg is always good and the value is excellent, and above all, the service is always great.  The mark-up for wine is exceptional; very fair and competitive.  I have never had a bad experience in Keg.  Highly recommended.",4
"Overall, great environment & food. Server/waitress was fantastic.",4
From beginning to end it was a great experience. The food was awesome as always!,4
Amazing food and great service!,4
Beautiful evening and Tim was the best server! Attentive and kind to my daughter and her bestie for their dinner out. Thank you!,4
My wife and I really enjoyed our anniversary lunch from start to finish.  Great food and service. Steak was cooked perfectly. Ice cream cake on the house was a pleasant surprise.  Will be back for sure.,4
Amazing service and great food,4
"One of our meals was incorrect, so we didn‚Äôt eat together. We were both  comped, without asking! Now there is service and excellent management.",4
"Great greeting, good service and nice ambience.  I had the ribsteak, which was ok, but unfortunately not as tender as I was expecting it to be and some tough nervs that did not help either.  Overall, nice but I would not recommend the ribsteak for what its worth.  Cheers!",2
"My only review will only be on our server.
As far as I concerned, every other aspect of The Key is completely and totally expected in the first place. 

That being said‚Ä¶

This Lady was beyond outstanding. I forget her name but I‚Äôm sure you know who served us.
In all the many years, and I‚Äôve been to countless restaurants over the decades, not just in Canada, but many other countries as well, this incredibly waitress was the best that I recall, having served us. 

She‚Äôs a natural, and couldn‚Äôt possibly have done any better or more to make our dining experience extraordinary.

I usually tip 10-15% first onquality of service and then only on items consumed (NEVER on the taxes).

I will not tell you the tip we gave her, that‚Äôs none of your business, but I will say this, it was quite substantial. 
She almost fainted, and we told her she was more than deserving of that.

The bottom line is this, too many wait staff are expectant of a good tip, irregardless of how they serve or perceive themselves and their patrons.

Not in my books‚Ä¶I have left many times without a tip, and then went to the manager on duty and explained why. I‚Äôm definitely not bashful.

I know that sounds arrogant, but it‚Äôs not.

When you visit a fine establishment, EXCELLENT‚Ä¶NOT VERY GOOD‚Ä¶.EXCELLENT  service IS EXPECTED without fail.

Our server was beyond excellent, she was absolutely superb, caring, attentive, and as I said earlier‚Ä¶a natural. I believe that‚Äôs her natural personality trait.

Finally I will say this, with absolutely no disrespect to The Keg, however, I have been to Michelin Star establishments and their wait staff is perfect. 

The reason I‚Äôm bringing that to your attention,(damn, I wish I could remember her name), is that fact, she not only could, with ease, be a server in one of those extraordinary establishments (if she chooses), however, in my opinion she could train and supervise the servers for these restaurants.

I hope you SHOW her this review!!",3
"We had an amazing meal. Our server Chase was friendly, professional and funny. The patio was clean and energetic. Our steaks was cooked to perfection. We will definitely come to this location again.",4
the service was unreal ! celebrated an anniversary and couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place to do so,4
"Our server Jermey was absolutely amazing. He was knowledgeable about wines, great personality, and an overall great guy! Keep up the great work !!!! Everyone should ask for him by name !!!!",4
Food was great. Service prompt and above expectation.,3
"Service wasn‚Äôt great. With servers wearing facemasks it‚Äôs even easier for them to ignore guests who are literally just trying to get a glass a water üòÇ also very rushed, having the starters come out quick was great, but we weren‚Äôt even halfway through our starter and the main plates got brought to our table. Then as above, we just wanted water, which we had ordered at the beginning but we never got it and when we tried to get the servers attention it‚Äôs like all were blind and couldn‚Äôt see us. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

But the food was delicious and saved the night. Shrimp and lobster starter and the rib steak were exquisite.",2
There wasn't a lot of option for dairy and citric acid allergy.  Some of the items were overpriced.,2
"Great outdoor patio. Good layout in keeping with safety protocols. Great experience overall, staff was awesome.",4
Very nice place for dinner,4
"So glad you have more vegetarian options, they‚Äôre delicious",4
"Server was super friendly, quick and asked us how our food was. Always great service and the food was delicious, as it always is.",4
"The tables were not properly cleaned. 
The vegetable side offering with the steak should be more generous and could use more variety.
Whiskey Sour was not good, it didn't have any cherries in it. 


Peppercorn steak was amazing.",2
"excellent location, friendly staff and great ambience.",4
3 steaks were cooked to perfection. Great service from everyone there.,4
Our server was very thoughtful and the patio was quite the perfect fit for our occasion.,4
Had a great dining experience. This Keg location is huge with the most up to date and beautiful interior of any of the numerous locations I‚Äôve been to in 40+ years of dining at the Keg. We were seated on the unexpected awesome patio at the rear of the restaurant and was looked after by the perfectly attentive waiter Tim. The food was delicious as usual. It‚Äôs not often when I leave a restaurant and am completely satisfied and this impressed. Well done.,4
Love peppercorn new your steak !! And service is very professional,4
Ted is the best waiter. He made our experience so amazing,4
Enjoyable dining experience. Our server was great and the steaks were excellent. Looking forward to our next visit.,4
"Masks were implemented, there was lots of patio space and my celiac needs were adhered to. Excellent restaurant and service.",4
"Food was good, service was excellent. The patio was nice and it was quiet which I appreciated.",4
"Didn‚Äôt reach the heights of previous visits, pre-pandemic. Server was lovely but the food was not up to par. Caesar salad was watery, with no seasoning or flavour of any kind. Steak was the good but the sides ? Again, no seasoning on the veg, I counted 6 individual mushrooms and the side of fries was tiny. Huge disappointment.",1
The worst food and service I‚Äôve ever received at the keg will not be ever returning to this location. Disgusting,0
Terrible service at this Keg location. The food came out wrong twice. The waitress was horrible and never came back to the table. Food was sent back we weren‚Äôt charged for it but not the point we went for dinner because we were hungry they offered us a dessert and then charged us for it. We left hungry and it was too late to go anywhere else so our first night away in 2 years was completely ruined,0
Had a great outdoor experience.  Food never disappoints. Friendly staff.,4
"Keg is a staple! However, the steak was returned 3 times. Very appreciative the manager took ownership & deducted my friend‚Äôs meal from the bill. I just love the Keg. Always great service & value for the money.",4
"The steak was wonderful and I appreciated the attentive service pertaining to my allergies. The salad and veggies could use some work. 

My main issue was that I spent time looking for a location that has the patio booking and I booked outdoor seating at this location. When we got there they said there was no outdoor seating. I know this is definitely first world problems, but I wouldn‚Äôt have booked it if I knew that they wouldn‚Äôt honour the reservation. I didn‚Äôt appreciate that and I haven‚Äôt been to a restaurant that did that in Toronto to date.",2
"Had a great time, food was great and so was the service.",4
"Great food, a lot of options",4
"Took myself on a well needed date. The service was fast and friendly and the food, amazing of course.
For anyone dining alone I recommend the high top tables facing the bar, makes you feel right at home. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",4
Dined at the York st. Downtown location. We tried the Summer Lobster menu‚Ä¶Great value for what you get & the price you pay. Service & wait staff was great. We made reservations & didn‚Äôt have to wait too long:) Only suggestion is increase the lighting a bit in some parts of the patio area at the back if possible (ie. patio lights or candles on table)‚Ä¶It can get a little too dark in some seating areas but others are nicely lit. But overall it‚Äôs still nice & inviting. We would definitely go back & prolly order the lobster/steak summer special again before the offer is gone at the end of August:),3
It was great to dine at The Keg again after being locked down for so long. The food and service were as good as ever and we felt very safe with the protocols that were in place.,4
Food is always great at the Keg!  Another shout out to Lilly behind the bar on the patio - always a pleasure to see her and her customer service is off the charts!!,4
Always consistent quality and service!,4
The atmosphere is great.  It has been a long time since I can have a real date.  Thanks.,4
"We had reservations for 6 pm and were seated promptly. Unfortunately we then sat unattended at an empty table for 15 minutes until a professional and personable server/manager? (not sure his role) named Garrett came by to check on us. He apologized for our server not reappearing and took excellent care of us from this point on. Stopping by often to ensure we had everything we needed - which we did. 
Garrett is amazing.",4
"We were in Toronto for the weekend with my friends and we really enjoy our moments shared at the Keg York street. The server was nice ü§©and the food was greatüòªüî• (shoutout to the bread and butter üòÑ) 
If we¬¥re back Toronto we‚Äôll greatly appreciate to come back to eat",4
"server was amazing, delicious food & we very much enjoyed our visit",4
Prime rib was over cooked from what was requested.  The Oscar sirloin was limited with the bernaise sauce and the lobster gratinee was limited as there was no lobster in the cavity or if there was it was very small,2
"Celebrating an anniversary and had a wonderful dinner. We were seated promptly, service was great. All of our dishes were prepared perfectly and all delicious. The Keg is our go to for great food and service.",4
Great staff and customer service.  Great food and drinks.,4
"I've been to the Keg many times, but never to the York St. location. This location is really great! It's actually huge! Great layout and super friendly service. Food was delicious, as I've come to expect from The Keg. Will definitely be coming back!",4
"Very good as usual, the Keg still holds up to its original brand",3
"EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT!!!! Emily our server was so sweet. We‚Äôve never had a server ever that was so nice. 
The ambience and the place itself was very quiet, perfect to have an intimate dinner. Food was also outstanding and fairly priced.",4
"Went for dinner to Keg to celebrate my brother‚Äôs birthday. Had a reservation for 7pm and was taken to our seats on time. We booked an outdoor table but because it was windy the host was kind enough to offer us a table inside. Our server, Mitchell was excellent and made our experience wonderful. Will definitely go there again!",4
Everything was awesome! So good to be back,4
"Great lunch with my client, reservation was great.",3
Fantastic and reliable.  It‚Äôs always a good time at the Keg.,4
"I was upset because I made a reservation weeks in advance to celebrate a friend's birthday. I explicitly requested outside, back patio, in my first booking and then subsequently through the check-in process. I was then seated inside and so had to take an available table at the patio bar, as, for medical reasons, I cannot sit inside. I was extremely upset and no one at the restaurant seemed to care at all. Completely unprofessional. What is the point of making a reservation weeks in advance?",1
"Our server was great, unfortunately I forgot her name. She was very pleasant and respectful.",4
Food was perfect as usual and service was fantastic.,4
"The reason I keep coming back to The Keg is you know what you are going to get. Good food, adorable, reliable.",4
"It was nice to be at the Keg again and sit inside.  The food and service was great, as usual.  Consistently great service.",4
Great spot,4
"As always, The Keg was a good, solid dining experience. The food was good, the service excellent and the ambiance very nice. The outdoor patio was lovely and gave the impression of being inside but with a refreshing breeze, which was very reassuring given the pandemic. The large outdoor patio is not right on the curb, but tucked behind, between buildings in a couryard. Overall a very pleasant evening.",3
The food was absolutely amazing. Thank you for being so wonderful. Service was top-notch!,4
"Great service and great location.
I would recommend this Keg to anyone.",4
"Great food, amazing service, and the pandemic felt like a really distant pass dining indoors.  Don't miss out - this location is doing everything right!",4
Food is always great but our server Sara B. was super funny. She made the night even better!,4
"Booked an outdoor table, got sat inside and told we‚Äôd have to wait and see for a table on the patio. Why bother booking an outdoor table then‚Ä¶ I would‚Äôve booked a reservation at the keg closer to my condo.",0
Everything was great and our server was amazing.  I don‚Äôt remember her name which is a bummer,4
"We ordered the Rib Eye, one medium well and one medium, both tasted great, I personally prefer medium well.  Covid screening by law is good and neutral.
Service is good
Great space and ambiance both indoor and outdoor",3
Everything I expected and more. The service was spot on (we even had a large group). The food was cooked to perfection and we had zero issues. Will definitely be back.,4
"I have to say that was my most unenjoyable meal at the keg... Now I didn't order the best thing as was trying to have a light lunch  so I ordered the chicken Caesar salad - the chicken didn't have any seasoning on it - we actually thought it was boiled - the salad was wilted lettuce - the only reason I ate what I did was because I was starving...Made a reservation - still had to wait to be seated - over all not a good experience - if I had never been to the keg, I wouldn't go back....",0
The Keg Steakhouse is best place for diner in Canad√°.,4
The service and food was very good.  The server was very thorough and quick.,4
Best steak I have ever eaten. The staff were amazing. Very friendly and professional.,4
"Always a pleasure to eat at the Keg on York St!!  Service is fantastic, food is very good and CONSISTENT!!! My first choice for lunch!",4
"I've come to expect more from the keg than what we got last night... We waited at our table for 20 minutes without even being asked if we wanted water, let alone to order anything. A server passing by noticed we were getting ready to leave and asked if we'd been seen yet, and helped us order. We were at the keg to celebrate my birthday, as our past experiences at the keg had been outstanding. This visit was underwhelming, sadly. Will be visiting the other downtown location in the future.",2
Our server was awesome!,4
Our server Garrett wa very attentive and courteous. The GM Matt stopped by to chat to ensure all was good with us. The Lobsterfest 2lb lobster was excellent. Nice to dine out again.,4
"Great patio, great food, great service",4
"Nice service and good food. We ordered two steak and lobsters. We both ordered medium rare top sirloin steaks (6 oz and 8 oz). Somehow the 6 oz had much more flavour and taste than the 8 oz. Regardless, both meals were still great.
We will be back again.",4
Love this location and happy to see familiar faces on staff from years ago.,4
"We very much appreciated all the public health measures to make our evening safe and enjoyable‚Ä¶our server Madison was outstanding‚Ä¶very attentive,professional and is a great asset to the keg‚Ä¶the hostess was very instructive and welcoming",4
"We arrived and had to wait a bit even though we were right on time for our reso, we sat down and the table was really dirty with crumbs everywhere, the bartender made me gin on the rocks even though I ordered a dirty gin martini, the shrimp was chewy, asparagus was bad and dry and the only good part was that our server was very professional and very on it, he was great.",1
"Service and food was great!! 
Thank you",4
We had a fun time :),4
Our favourite place to have dinner or celebrate a birthday.,4
Always great good and our server was exceptional!,3
Very friendly and efficient server. I think her name was Sarah.,4
"Excellent service, waitress was so friendly and helpful.  Food delicious as always.  Steak cooked to order",4
Wonderful for our first in-dining experience!,4
"It was my husbands Birthday. Although it rained, but we still had so much fun",4
It rained but the staff was very attentive and we all made the best of our patio dinner!,4
"Went to the keg for my birthday I had an amazing time with my boyfriend. The waitress was really nice she gave us really soft good bread to start. We ordered the mushroom Neptune i don‚Äôt like seafood but it tasted good, starter mixed green salad which was well worth the portion. For the main course I ordered the top sirloin with garlic mash and my boyfriend got the pistachio crusted salmon both really good as well. The only thing I had a problem with was I had to wait an extra 10 minutes to be seated even though my reservation was at 9:15 I got seated at 9:27 but other than that the service an the food was exceptional.",4
"After making a reservation two days prior we were being seated outside the patio by an office building.  I refused to sit there, especially as there were at least five empty tables on the patio.  They eventually seated us on the patio.  How insulting!     Also, my friend and I both ordered starter salads and then hamburgers.  I got my salad but the server for some reason replaced my friend's fries with her salad.  She was very nice but got the order wrong.",3
"The patio was very nice.  Lots of shade.  The servers were very polite, friendly and attentive.  Go to this Keg frequently and I'm always satisfied.  Would recommend this location.",4
Would have been nice for some recognition of the special occasion grad dinner for my son.,3
"Great experience, good atmosphere and terrific service",4
"Worst KEG experience ever! The quality of steak was low, they couldn‚Äôt make it medium rare, the service was poor, they didn‚Äôt consider my request at reservation about my partner‚Äôs birthday. And finally they overcharged us with the food that we had asked to change and had not even touched it.",1
Emily was friendly and took great care of us! Excellent service!!!! We love the Keg and will be back again! Thank you!,4
"My friends and I love visiting the Keg especially the York location as it has a beautiful patio. Christian at the front was so kind to accommodate us as we were running a little bit late. Amanda, our server, was so kind and patient. We will definitely be returning. Please send our thanks!",4
"They were very accommodating even though our party was late, and the meals and drinks were superb. When next I‚Äôm in Toronto, I‚Äôll definitely be back here.",4
"Everything was great!!! Thank you! Good food, service and ambience! Definitely will go back!",3
We sat at the bar and the bartenders we amazing. Going back in 2 weeks.,4
I love the keg. They always have the best food and service.,4
"Great food, very nice patio. Good service. I recommend it.",4
"We always enjoy going to the Keg.But there were some mistakes with the orders; which they corrected right away.
Two medium rare brought medium well. One we had returned, the other I was too embarrassed to ask for another steak because they have already brought the wrong lobster. 
Otherwise, we love the Keg! Thank you.",3
Took my wife for her 50th birthday with our son. Her steak was not cooked the way she asked.  Both the manager and waitress were amazing in taking care of my wife and giving her the true keg experience. We will be back.  It was great to be back on a Keg patio!,3
Great experience,4
Very nice location and ambiance. Our server was very kind. Thanks again Chloe. Food was good and cooked to our liking.,3
"Keg on York street is an amazing place. A little diferent from other Kegs, this place is quite big for inside dining with a lovely patio outside. The staff is professional, very friendly and hospitable. Overall, a great experience.",4
"Lovely experience.
Chloe was a sweet server. Beautiful scenery and spot where i sat",4
The food just wasn‚Äôt very good. Still we enjoyed our night.,2
Even with the rain it was a good time and great food,4
patio is lovely and service was great! would definitely come back.,4
Amanda provided great service!!,3
"Alisha our server from 3-7 was amazing. She was funny, attentive, provided great suggestions and made the night really great.",4
Every time I go to The Keg (regardless of location) I feel like a member of upper class society. Steak + Lobster and cock tails? Yeah that's the good life.,4
"First time going was last night, and the service was the best I've ever had. Amazing waitress, who made us feel so comfortable and gave us great service. Definitely the best Keg I have ever been to, and I would forsure go back!",4
"First dinner out in 17 months and it didn't disappoint. Can always count on The Keg for great food & great service. Our server Kyle was great. Very friendly, polite guy who accommodated us on our requests. Looking forward to going back in the very near future.",3
People arrived 20 minutes before and were turned away despite the table being unoccupied already.  They had spare space at the bar and extra tables but would not let us sit at them after our 1.5 hours were up and seated us at a table in the rain.  We are regulars and were treated horribly.,1
As always a great place to eat and relax with friends.,3
"Absolutely delicious food, amazing service and lovely ambiance. We look forward to going again soon!",4
"Very good service.  Nice decor and ambience.  Food is good for the price.
Worth going to.",3
"This was my first dining experience during COVID and I was celebrating my birthday. It exceeded my expectations! The food, service and patio were excellent. It is no wonder the restaurant is so popular. The only annoyance was screaming from fans watching a sport on the tv at the other side of the patio. It was quite excessive.",4
The quality of the food at the Keg is always consistent - and fabulous!!,4
"Definitely somewhere i will recommend. The service, food everything was awesome.",3
Stefano was a joy to work with. He was amazing in his customer care and made our experience all the more better. It was our anniversary and my girlfriend‚Äôs first time at the Keg. Definitely a great place to be.,4
"great to be back at restaurants, they were friendly, super safe, and got a nice table on the patio!",4
"Tim served us and was fantastic! Fun and professional, caring for my dietary needs.  A beautiful patio!",4
Server was amazing. So nice to be back to a favorite patio,4
Great Patio and although the temperature was high in Toronto we felt cool sitting at the Patio,4
Service was excellent. Food was as usual. Always know what to expect with The Keg.,4
CHOOSE A DIFFERENT LOCATION. There for 3hours mostly waiting for food. We got our water refilled when we got dessert. Waiter wasn‚Äôt very attentive as we kept trying to make eye contact but he would just avoid. Got the wrong side and prime rib was medium well instead of rare. Seen so many people seated and leave before us. Longest meal I had and it was exhausting.,0
"Great to be back, fab service, tasty food and good wines!",4
"The ambiance on the terrace was so conducive to to know you would just feel special. 
The staff were friendly, accommodating, efficient and friendly. 
My only negative is I ordered my Steak Medium Rare as did my friend who ordered Prime Rib. 
They were Medium Well to Well done. 
They were still really good.",4
Very good as usual. Thanks.,4
"Excellent service and great people, the food is very good",3
"Excellent staff and service. Always quick, and friendly staff",4
It was great overall.,4
"Our first patio dinner at the Keg - great food - and amazing service - I unfortunately cannot remember the name of our server, however we were seated on the York St patio side for a 7:30 PM  reservation - He was superb - engaging, hospitable and extremely helpful. Can‚Äôt wait to go back again soon - it really is always a pleasure dining at The Keg.",4
Great night. Service was good. Restaurant was clean. Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxccxxxxxxxxxxxff do ghdhfhuejxbdgddbsuevejsvhsbdjfnebjssbgebdbdjdh fudge f  BC dbdhdbdjhddbdjehrhu,4
Went to the keg with my boyfriend  and his family. It was his brothers first time visiting toronto so we visited the keg on York street. The server was helping everyone else except for us. The table beside us came in after us and got their food before us. We were not too happy with the service but we absolutely loved the food. We tipped the restaurant because we wanted the cooks to get a tip for their delicious food but our server wasn‚Äôt the best. The server got our order wrong a few time and was only acting nice and talked to us while we were paying . Would rate the service 1/10. Ive been to other kegs and their service was always better.,2
The girl that was standing outside (hostess) long blond hair had no personality upon greeting. We are very used to ‚Äúwelcome to the keg‚Äù. ... nothing like that and even the girl that brought us to the table did not say a word except at the table she said your waitress will be right with you. Ajax keg has much more polite workers. Sure looks like your hostess isn‚Äôt happy to be back working after covid. Our server was pleasant. Not sure I would come back to this location. The food as always was excellent,1
"It‚Äôs what you except at the keg, great food and great service. However, we were seated outside of the patio near the building it wasn‚Äôt the greatest ambience and lowered the overall experience but I still thoroughly enjoyed it",3
Patio was nice however seemed to be an issue with bugs due to the plants in the area. The staff was able to move our table however an excessive number of flies made for a less than desirable eating atmosphere.  Food was ok. Service was great.,3
"The server was very polite.  The food was great (Bleu Cheese crusted Filet Mignon with Garic Mash), it came out very hot.  Ambiance was quite nice as I was unaware of the large outdoor dining area in the back of the restaurant.   Drinks were excellent as always.  I freauent the Keg a lot because I like the consistency.",3
We were sat outside of the keg in their temporary patio. It wasn‚Äôt as sheltered as the normal patio so it was very windy! The food was good but not outstanding so the value was questionable. The scallops were quite small and steak was good on the very chewy side. The servers were very nice.,3
"""I love the relaxed feel of this place. Service was well-timed and friendly."" A++",4
"For the price, u would expect the napkins to the same color of white. The table was shaky, but the wait staff was excellent.  Food was good, but not for the price level.",2
Nice time. Great service. Jill was pleasant and very accommodating.,4
Our server Kyle was great - his pacing was perfect and he made the evening much more enjoyable.  I just wish we didn‚Äôt have the time limits for the evening and would have stayed for dinner.,4
The manager is nice and helpful. She help us to find two tables suit our needs.,3
"Had a reservation.  Got our table very quickly.  Service was good, given the circumstances.  Food was excellent.  Overall, a very good experience.",3
"Typically you can‚Äôt go wrong with the Keg great food, great service but it seems the pandemic has service levels suffering at this location. We barely finished our meal and were still enjoying our drinks when we were unceremoniously told we needed to vacate the table in five to ten minutes for the next reservation. I‚Äôve never experienced this at the Keg and frankly after spending hundreds of dollars on a nice meal out expected a little bit better treatment. It ruined an otherwise nice evening out. I‚Äôve been out to a few fine dining establishments over the past few weeks since the lockdown lifted and never once had this issue. I‚Äôll be taking my business elsewhere.",0
"Wait time for our food took awhile. But over all had a great experience. 

Thank you!",4
"with everyone considering going on with COVID, my experience at the Keg patio was amazing.

the front door greeter were awesome and out server was awesome as food.

As for the food - it was amazing",4
Everything was perfect. Food was great! I'd recommend and return again!,4
"Our food took an hour and a half,  the oven roasted chicken was super dry and could not be eaten, I instructed them to write happy birthday on the plate with a slice of cake. That was missed and I had to remind the waiter, she did not know what I was talking about. After she spoke with her manager I was told it could not be done. This was a disappointing experience over all. The Keg is usually good but I will not be going back to that location.",0
Great location to dine for any occasion. The garlic mashed potatoes are my all-time favourite.,4
The patio was fantastic. They were set up with comfortable seats while maintaining the social distances. We had a divider to the next table . It made us feel comfortable in dining. The food was great. It was certainly a great get away from all the home cooking.,4
Great evening!,4
"Unfortunately the portion sizes were much smaller than I remember especially the twice baked potato. My boyfriend got a steak medium and it came out well done, the steak was very thin and didn‚Äôt feel like an 6oz. The service was pretty slow, took us close to 2 hours to eat and my boyfriends second drink unfortunately came after the main was finished. Not really worth $185 for 2 people",1
Absolutely amazing night out.   Food was delicious and service was great!,4
"I ordered a sirloin steak and twice baked potato and a strawberry daiquiri and everything was beyond amazing potato was so light and fluffy, steak was cooked perfect , and my daiquiri was made awesome. Also split a ceaser salad with my daughter and it was perfect also, our server was so sweet and polite, did an amazing job making sure we always had everything we needed. I loved the back patio was bigger then I thought it was I will definitely come back again and again",4
"Friendly staff, good location and great food! New York steak is amazing üëå",4
"I would love if the patio would have more shade, it was a hot day and sitting in the sun made the experience is a bit steamy :P",4
"It was good, however the table we were at looked in on the back of the bar.  We listened to staff talking and cleaning in the back room as our table looked into a cleaning closet as well. 
Our service was good, but slow and our beverages we sent back. 
We normally never have any issues with our service or overall dining experience",3
"I don‚Äôt t need 50 characters, ‚Äúit was just beyond perfect‚Äù",4
"The steak was pretty good, not the best that we've had a Keg but still good. The vegetables and french fries were incredible.  Billy Miner pie was amazing.",3
"Food was amazing, staff are super nice and helpful. Steak was cooked to perfection just the way we expected it. Appetizers were delicious.",4
"Had a very pleasant experience. Server (I believe her name is Michelle?) was nothing short of amazing and the food was incredibly well made. I will definitely be returning, thanks again for the great night!!",4
Was sat in a alley way and server seemed not to be a good fit for the restaurant. Hostesses were great.,1
The manager Chris took great care of us.  It was our anniversary. Got us a great table.  Ambiance and meal was outstanding.  The server was fantastic also.  This Keg has the best patio at the back.,4
"Our meal at York St Keg was sensational; there was no way to tell that they had been closed for so much of the pandemic, or so recently closed.  My partner had the prime rib, and it was perfectly cooked, melt in the mouth.  I had a teriyaki sirloin and with was cooked exactly how I asked for it.   I worked in restaurant kitchens for 16 years, I know how to cook a steak at home, but there are times when nothing else will do but a meal at the Keg.  Kudos to the kitchen and all the other staff at York St Keg!",4
"The staff were friendly, the ambiance was just right and the food was delicious and full of flavours.",4
Throughly enjoyed our visit! Excellent server and the manager to our table to introduce herself. Very nice touch! Oh and they brought my son a piece of cake to celebrate his 30th birthday. We love the Keg.,4
Out door dining well spaced and service was perfect!,3
"We had a wonderful dinner! It was amazing, high quality food and impeccable service thanks to our amazing server Val. We highly recommend the High Tea and Gin Basil Lemonade. A surprising dark horse was the Garlic Cheese Toast appetizer too! And of course the steak was uh.maze.ing. There was great ambiance and it was just an amazing place for special occasions. I can‚Äôt wait to go back :)",4
"Fabulous meal as expected at the Keg York St. Attentive, efficient and friendly service by Jeremy. We were very impressed by the Covid protocols and felt very safe dining on the lively courtyard patio! The team here hasn‚Äôt missed a beat since reopening only 10 days ago after many months of pandemic lockdown. Thank you!",4
"Came to the Keg at York Street and it was relatively easy to get a reservation which I appreciated a lot, to celebrate my husband's birthday. Getting seated was a breeze literally. It was windy that day and I felt we were in a literal wind tunnel in that patio area! Other than that everything was great and went smoothly. Food is always amazing and delicious. Would come back in a heart beat.",2
The server was amazing. Attentive and took the time to chat and get to know us,4
"The dinner was nice.  Server terrific & personable.  Food good but portions a bit small.  (But I understand with COVID restaraunts have to make up for losses.  My cranberry soda was mainly soda not cranberry juice.)

However, the number of emails and texts attached to the reservation was really annoying.  I think it will put people off if there is too much texting/confirming etc.  

Our server was great.  The food was great.  The patio lovely.  It is so sad that the beautiful restaraunt is empty indoors.  Hopefully, this will change very soon.",3
"Not too many people, servers were nice and helpful",4
The music was a bit loud. It would better if they had calming music instead of jazz vs.,3
"I enjoyed our Fathers Day experience at the Keg location on York Street.

My only feedback is the table we sat in was not suitable for my Dad who is 89 years and depends on a cane for support.  We were given a high table with tall bar like seats.  I noticed around us there were tables we could have been seated in and also was tight on the space around us due to those new clear shields.  There was a 5 seater table behind us that was designated for 2 people but had 5 seats.

Just something I would suggest to the server who brought us to the table who should have noticed an elderly person should have sat at a lower table.",3
Always love the food. Get the rib eye!!!,4
"Waiter forgot some dishes, but quickly made it up and comped first round of drinks",4
"Exceptional service, delicious food and very professional staff as always.",4
"Had dinner to celebrate Father‚Äôs Day and my son‚Äôs birthday. Dinner was great and everything was clean, spaced apart and not overcrowded. Overall it was very pleasant and the only disappointment was that we didn‚Äôt get the usual slice of Billy Miner Pie for the birthday person.",3
"Amazing service, fast seating and friendly server",4
The food was great and the service was exceptional!,4
Amazing service at this location. The food was great and I can‚Äôt wait to go back.,4
The service was awesome. The food was amazing as always.,4
Very nice!,4
Very nice and spacious patio but hardly any coverings,4
"Everything was excellent, but the poor waitress forgot a few knives and one part of the meal. She was very nice and I get the feeling it was her first weekend back.",4
Enjoying a night out after being in Covid jail,3
Soooo good love this restaurant,4
Service great  but 2 of our steaks were  tough and chewy and we order them medium and snd medium rare.  Everything else was good.,3
Server was dismissive & didn't care about the birthday we were celebrating even though I reminded them twice.,2
Our server was a lot of fun and helpful with our diet restrictions. The food and drinks were yummy!,4
"It was my Birthday. They brought a cake for me, but without candles (due to Covid). Nice place with tasty food and nice atmosphere!",4
Excellent service and great food. Staff were very friendly and were constantly checking on our table.,4
Kyle is an excellent server will be back again.,4
"what a way to start off a patio season. great food, great vibes, incredible server!!!",4
Beautiful patio. We had sirloin Oscar and ribs. Delicious. Great service as usual.,4
Came with my little ones this time and we all loved it!,4
"Not all outdoor seated areas are the same. First we were out on the back patio, tight seating and little ambience, no heat lamps, etc. Luckily my bf called it and asked for better seating (indoor feel, felt like we joined the restaurant, great ambience, heating). Great place if you‚Äôre placed in a good spot!",3
"Always a great experience, favourite patio in the city",4
So nice to be out on a patio. Great service and food.,4
Our server was Stefano was amazing. Great times!!!,4
"Service was outstanding , staff genuinely invested in making my experience a positive one.  Food was extremely well done and my expectations are high of a keg.  Facilities were clean , welcoming and comfortable.  Great date night option.  I‚Äôll be returning!",4
"our dinner was delicious, the service was superb. it was so nice to be out again having a good time with friends and enjoying great food",4
Our fav spot. Gorgeous back patio. Consistently good food.,4
"Pretty good all things considered (rain, covid restrictions). Our waiter was dope",4
"Nicole M was so lovely! It rained on us and although we were happy to use our umbrella and wait it out, we were whisked away to a covered table when it got bad. Thank you for such a delicious meal- we enjoyed the prime rib, striploin, baked shrimp and brownie sundae. Cheers!",4
The service and ambience was excellent despite the bit of delay due to rain. My steak wasn‚Äôt made as ordered but it was soon rectified.,4
"We picked The Keg for our first outing after lockdown, did not disappoint!! Service, food everything was excellent, even during the raining period we had an excellent service and they were able to relocate us while maintaining healthy protocols!!!",4
All three steaks were very tough.,2
The add on patio gives such an amazing city view! Spent my boyfriends birthday and it was the cherry on top of us to have dinner at the keg! Sarah our server was amazing and so kind!,4
"Everything was fine and understandable considering opening weekend kinks. We were seated at the very last table out of the restaurant between the two buildings so it just felt like we were too far away for the server to be with us regularly. We had a few drinks mis-timed with courses, had to ask for water multiple times. Food was great, our server Anna was lovely and doing her best, and took care of a glass of wine which missed dinner service. 

Totally understandable after so long away and with these heavy restrictions. We had lots of fun, the food was awesome and we are happy to be back. Good luck!",3
"The Keg was our first dinner out since the restrictions lifted. We came with the expectation that things may take a little longer than usual or they may be out of stock of some things. 

We were pleasantly surprised by the menu offerings and how much they managed to get in stock.

Our server was fantastic. Our meal was great. The ambiance was amazing.
The table next to us complaining about things was uncalled for - shame on them! 

See you again soon!",3
"It was just the second night of them being allowed to open again, and they obviously have all new staff. I hope it gets better as this is our neighborhood spot. We were first taken out to a table outside of the Keg patio, in the beating sun and when we asked for a different table, had to wait there standing for a while until they brought us back in to the restaurant to give us another table. We had a reservation so I'm not sure why they put us there.
Then, lots of little things. Black (i think char) was in the escargot and there were hairs in both of our cutlery napkins and the glasses had marks. And I found a piece of what I think was a rock. It wasn't The Keg that we were used to. 
They also kept a staff table in the back and so we could overhear the staff talking and they kept coming back there to hang out. It just seemed odd.",2
Amazing staff amazing food! Was soo happy to be back there on the patio enjoying it all!,4
"We had a great experience in the keg, our server Jeremy was great and made the evening very good. Will definitely return",4
"Only real complaint was the 50-minute wait despite having a reservation, which was understandable given it was the first night open. Friendly service and an exceptional meal.",3
First night back on the patio was lovely! Aside from having to wait 15 mins for our table the food and service was perfect. The weather was a bit temperamental but all went well!,3
"The patio is beautiful. I had no idea there was this jewel smack in the middle of the financial district. The Keg is consistently great. From service , to the food, it‚Äôs one of my fav restaurants. This location is a definite must see.",4
Excellent food and service as always. Good times,4
"Fabulous food, great service and the red sangria was awesome!",4
"The outdoor seating is amazing, covered at the front and back.  The courtyard is all tented in separate boxes with very distanced tables.  There are heaters and it was protected from the wind.  We were comfy the whole time and the food was served hot!",4
"Patio dining lacked character, very plastic, not offset with flowers really or anything. Felt like you're eating in a tent. Where other restaurants have created more atmosphere to soften the look, this seemed very bare. Also the wine list was lacking. That being said, I got to eat at a restaurant in Toronto!!! The staff was friendly and the food was delicious.",3
"Nice place, always great food. Was not really satisfied with the stuff appearance.",4
"Tim was absolutely outstanding! After not being able to dine out for months, it was a wonderful first time back at the Keg thanks to Tim‚Äôs fantastic service!",4
Everything was perfect!,4
"Great experience, always is. Lacked in menu items though, specifically the appetizers. ex. Your French Onion Soup would be perfect during this chilly patio season. 
Thanks!",4
Great dinner,4
It was really good food. Noise level was low because it was a cold patio day. Service was great,4
Anna was a spectacular server. She was so sweet and made perfect recommendations. She also made an effort to recognize our anniversary which made us feel so special. Thanks for a great evening!,4
Great service!,4
Patio dining - not expecting much. Service was quite slow for a Monday night. Steaks could have been seared a little higher temp for better flavour. Overall a decent meal.,3
"The food was amazing like always!!! However, with the recent tents set up outside on the patio and with all the surrounding tables full I felt a little uncomfortable in terms of covid-safety since I felt like there wasn‚Äôt enough air curiculation:",2
Fantastic place to celebrate any occasion or enjoy an evening out. Both the food and service were excellent!,4
The patio set up is awesome!,4
Thanks Jill!   Great patio.,4
Heater was broken which was not advised of on initial call for reservation.,3
It was freezing website did not say outdoor dining steak was over done potatoes were cold and not mashed,0
"Patio heaters were totally inadequate. And patio was the only space open with new rules.
Had our winter coats on the whole time.",2
I had a wonderful birthday dinner with my husband. The steaks were delicious and we felt completely  safe dining indoors as they were following proper guidelines in relation to COVID-19.,4
"Excellent Food and Service, especially during these weird times of COVID.

Kudos to The Staff, who go the extra mile, to keep us safe.",4
"Just a quiet evening shared with my husband!  Was very apprehensive about sitting inside the restaurant during this COVID problem - we were both pleasantly surprised that The Keg at this location created a most comfortable and worry-free environment - the service was great, as usual and the food again, as always, did not disappoint.  Looking forward to returning soon.",4
"The food, service, and general ambiance at the Keg (on York Street) has always been excellent. The only complaint that I would have is that they play the background music far too loud. For those of us who have difficulty hearing a conversation when there is background noise (no matter how pleasant the noise) it is a challenge.",4
"Tasty and delicious food, and great service as usual.  This Keg location is well prepared for covid to ensure you are seated ad enjoy your meal safely.",4
This is the best Keg location in the city for sure,4
Amazing loved it,4
Great patio with heat lamps and fireplace.  Perfect for a business lunch.,4
Amazing service,4
Excellent service!  + felt very comfortable with COVID protocols at this restaurant.,4
"Good emphasis on safety. Outdoor heaters a little inadequate to be truly comfortable.
Food to Keg standard. Rarely do you get a negative or positive surprise at the Keg. It is very reliable.",2
Our server Hillary was amazing! We are never disappointed with the good quality and service at the Keg. Would totally go back to this location again.,4
Celebrating our marriage with parents,4
"Good value for money. Great food, with excellent service. Loved it.",4
"Our waitress, this cute Asian is hands down one of my favourite waitresses of all all time. Everything she did was perfect. Highly recommend!",4
We always love coming to The Keg. The outdoor patio is great during this time and the food is always delicious. Thank you!,4
Daughters Birthday,4
Well done !,4
The appetizers were great. The vegetables from the main course had absolutely no flavour. Service was terrible. Don‚Äôt remember my servers name but she did not introduce herself until about an hour into our visit. We did not know who our server was in the beginning because of the lack of introduction as well as having multiple people come to our table. Our dirty plates were left on the table for a good 30 minutes before they were cleaned up. We also had to wait quite a while for our server to check back on us so we could order the bill.,1
Thank you for a wonderful evening. The staff did a fantastic job accommodating our request for patio seating. The service food and ambiance was perfect. Special thanks to our server Curt at patio bar who was incredible.,4
"Outstanding service and care by the servers. All staff were amazing. Both of our steaks were over cooked.  The asparagus on my plate were the thinnest and stringiest I have ever had and as a result were overcooked and limp. 

Saying all this we love the Keg and we will be back.",3
Great food and lovely setting,4
Terasse arriere incroyable,4
"Lovely patio, great food, and great service! We all thought that the precautions they are taking due to Covid-19 were done well and we felt safe. Overall really great experience! Thank you!",4
We had a lovely meal and were looked after a very pleasant server.,4
"The good was okay, the service was great.",2
The Keg is always reliable. I love the patio at York Street.,3
"Food quality, dish presentation and general attitude of waitress (rushed!) are subpar when compared to the Keg location in North York.",2
Always so good. So happy to be back!,4
Fantastic service so good we went twice in 3 days,4
Steak is better than my expectation. I would recommend medium rare prime rib for steak lovers.,4
Stefano was amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è,4
"It was great. Val was my server and she was great, very friendly and understanding when we requested a change of table.",4
First meal in doors since covid,4
Great service - menu on the high end from a price point of view,3
Birthday dinner with friends. Waiter was amazing ‚ÄúTim‚Äù. Best experience ever.,4
"I wouldn't recommend this location.  Took far too long at 2 pm to get our table, which we reserved.",3
Dinner with a colleague. Good food and value.,4
"Lovely service, great food but there was a very bad smell coming from the vent that was hard on the ambience!",3
The restaurant was very accommodating to our seating requests and the food and service were excellent,3
"our sever was excellent, attentive, constantly refilling our glasses, was never upset that we did not order wine or dessert with our meal",3
I expected the service to be faster for lunch but overall the food is great. Was disappointed with my drink.,3
Great place for a business lunch.,3
Well prepared meat. Vegetables feel like plastic so you better skip them. Can be very noisy.,3
"The keg can be hit and miss..
Almost like a fast food restaurant ...just costs more....and each keg has its own feel...
Overall on this occasion ...good.",3
It was a great night out for my birthday. Loved the meal and atmosphere. My daughter really wasn‚Äôt feeling well and struggled to finish her meal. The server brought her extra ice-cream so she would eat something. It was a great night!,4
"Music was unusually loud...not like the regular Keg ambiance. Waiter wasn‚Äôt overly attentive...had to call him over for drink refills, didn‚Äôt provide cream and sugar for coffees, etc.",4
Excellent  food and service but too noisy for us seniors. Tables too close together. Lack of privacy.,3
"I was surprisingly impressed. Started with the shrimp cocktail, shrimp was fresh and sauce tangy. Really enjoyed the prime rib. Cooked perfectly, right amount of fat and good horseradish sauce. I found the cauliflower mash a little disappointing, not much flavor, but the asparagus and tomato with it were good. Also had an iceberg wedge on the side and it was perfect, a lot of bacon and good bleu cheese. Overall very enjoyable.",4
Always good food and service here,4
Excellent service and food was amazing....I made our groups reservation 2 weeks in advance!,4
Great food and wine. Bar was a little slow but it was a busy night.,4
Service here is amazing - everyone we interacted with was great and friendly and helpful - great team great service,3
"Great spot down town. Excellent streaks, very tender.  Service was very attentive 
However the noise level was extremely high. Not suitable for the seniors in our group",3
We are from Philadelphia and it was our first  time visiting. Everything was awesome. The signature ice cream cake was amazing!!!,3
This is a great place for consistant food that is fantastic.,4
Just bomb that‚Äôs all I gotta say ! I would definitely fly back for the food.,4
"I arrived 20 minutes late, and was told that my table was given to someone else because I had missed my 15 minute window.

This is something that should be outlined when a reservation is made.",4
"Second time at a Keg Steakhouse and was not at all disappointed! The environment of the restaurant was so calm and quiet, very comfortable. The service was fantastic, and as usual the food was perfect. Will absolutely be coming here again for the next occasion!",4
"Food was excellent.
From the moment we came in till we exit, service and experience was fun, interactive and perfect.
The red wine Decoy was wow.",4
"Vibe and atmosphere were great, however my food was a bit bland.  Fries were not salted, a bit flimsy and lukewarm and the steak was not seasoned properly.",3
"Waiter was nice and informative
Checked on us regularly,

Food came nice and hot
Tasted amazing.

Drinks were of great value for the
quantity.",4
Great meal for Valentine‚Äôs Day. Giving out sparkling wine to people waiting for tables was a nice touch. Great food and service.,4
Food was peefect,4
Celebrated a great valentines day at the keg. Service was great - our server gave us some great recommendations and was just a delight. Food was fantastic as usual. Keg will always be a classic for me,3
"I made a mistake in ordering a sauce for my streak. Thought It was served on the side versus on top of the steak. The waiter and 2 Floor Manager‚Äôs took care of it. Brought another steak, without an extra charge. Perfectly handled. In addition to excellent food and service, they were professional... it wasn‚Äôt treated as a big deal or someone‚Äôs fault.",4
"As always a fantastic meal, good service and a great setting. I always look forward to my next visit to the Keg!",4
"We organized this meal to catchup with friends/co-workers. We picked this Keg location because the quality is always great. The service was very good. It was just a little too loud, which is understandable because it‚Äôs a busy restaurant.",3
"Our server was attentive and amusing, but the 4 appetizers we ordered (we were going to the game) were either undercooked or over-greasy/oily and did not sit well later on.",2
It was fabulous,4
Service was surprisingly slow considering the restaurant didnt appear busy.,3
"Lovely . Waitress was super nice and knowledgeable , overall great birthday experience",4
"Excellent service 
Food outstanding",4
"Great service, great steaks (and my guest enjoyed his prime rib very much). You can always count on the Keg for great beef",4
Food and drink always reliable...server we had was fantastic.,3
Salad and dessert were good. Steak had no or insufficient seasoning. Coffee was not hot.,3
Table service was fine with Madison but the hostess reception was very poor. Sorry but you need more professional staff - very amateur reception.,3
The food presentation was dull and it was fairly bland,1
Excellent service and amazing food!!!,4
Just a steak place nothing to write home about. Just ok,2
"Fried cauliflower was served cool/warm - not great.      Guinness beer was dripping all down the glass.   Served very messy.      Should have been wiped off before being served.    

The Keg on York was good but nothing was outstanding about the experience.    Service was fine - food was good but nothing stands out like when we go to other locations.       Burlington and Waterdown are outstanding.     Always hot and fresh and very friendly service.",3
"Great food, quite restaurant, a little bit pricy but worth it",4
As always The Keg is a grrat avenue to get a great meal.  It‚Äôs not cheap but I always enjoy it with great food.,4
To start off we had booked a booth but were given a table.Then we ordered 2 Keg size ceasers that didn't come with tobacco or Worchester sauce.Green beans were over cooked.My Lobster tail was smaller then a shrimp.They did say the would give me another shrimp I mean tail but was half way thru my meal.They did comp me for a drink.,1
Service was outstanding by Stefano... very attentive and excellent description of the food with perfect wine choice suggestions !,4
Everything was good except my wife had to return her steak for more cooking as it was not well enough done.  First time that has happened at the keg.  My wife only orders steak dinner at the keg restaurant and no other as she comments that the keg is the only place they do her steak the way she likes it.  Not this time unfortunately.,3
"The steak was pretty good, but the sides were just okay and not hot. Interior needs a refresh as furnishings are quite worn.",2
"Great food and service but it is very noisy. 
Good specials and the billy miner pie is to die for.",4
"Pros: best waiter ever, Tim. Very helpful and friendly guy, gave a lot of benefits to us and made us feel special. The ambiance was very nice and relaxing and the food was delicious. The appetizers came out fast and the bread was fresh. The washrooms were clean and peaceful. There was also free champagne which was a nice little touch. 

Cons: a little too noisy and the two person tables felt small without enough space to accommodate all the food and menus. The lack of a special free desert for birthdays was also something that left us wanting, since other high price restaurants often offer something like that. 

Overall this is a great place to spend your birthday or a special occasion.",3
One of our favourite places to eat.  Always consistently great food.  I love the French onion soup and the variety on the menu!,4
Service was excellent!  Our son has allergies and the Manager came out to speak to us a couple of times to review the menu and make recommendations.  Our server was outstanding!! Really great value!,4
Our waitress was great.   Food was great.   Had a great evening......will be back soon,4
"Excellent service by Mitch and food was exceptionally great, as per usual. Thanks so much for accommodating our earlier arrival. 
Mariela",4
Great service and made my birthday away from home one to remember,4
Excellent service and cuisine,4
"Excellent service .well done the Keg .we drop for new year dinning what a wonderful surprise exactly at our reservation time we went right away to our table .everything Wes perfect from the food ,the drinks and the service was far beyond excellent .excellent job well done ,enough staff ,the staff  were excellent all of them .The money was very reasonable as we already paid more for less quality of food and service .",4
Jeremy was our server and did an outstanding job.,4
"We came here for new years eve, we made our reservation in october 2019. Everything went smoothly until we left. Steven was an amazing server, he knows all about the food and wine. our food arrived at the perfect timing, everything was perfect for us. We get that new years eve was super busy and they are alot of walk ins. We made a reservation 2 months prior to this dinner at 830pm. the last 10 or 15 minutes, we had this skinny asian petite hostess who sat us down in the first place. we were preparing to leave and she just stood quite near to our table with the hostess tablet or something hinting that we should leave right away. we felt super uncomfortable and im pretty sure she just stood there for a few minutes and just gawking at our table. who does that? it was super awkward as me and my husband were celebrating our first nye together as newlyweds and was romantic. then we had another person who just stood there, staring our way. it was unpleasant to feel that we were being watched and chased out pretty much. She left after a few minutes just standing there and wished us have a good night and happy new year - out of nowhere. me and my husband were getting ready to leave... the whole experience as we were leaving was SUPER AWKWARD and Creepy.",3
Good overall experience. We really enjoyed our night at the Keg! Second new years dinner here and will definitely be back.,4
"Food was okay. Not what I usually expect from the keg. Very dark. Also not happy I called and asked if parking and was advised yes. Get there. No parking. Only paid. So we left
Our paid lot at a hotel. To pay yet again. Server was great. But overall not a great experience",2
Delicious food. Our server Tatiana was very helpful and kind. Nice staff on the front desk too. Thanks!,4
"Table seat was by hall way so lots of traffic as we were eating. Appetizers came after the main, server was good to remove from our bill without us asking. My prime rib was not cooked medium rare, was closer to medium. The meat wasn't very hot and bit dry. Overall not great meal.",1
Awesome waiter Tim.,4
"Wonderful night, great service. Awesome food and awesome company",4
"Made a reservation for 2 for my birthday‚Ä¶12/28. Was seated just before time, our waiter was great, food was great, and my birthday dessert was delivered! Only one complaint, the wait time to get food seemed extremely long, but they were busy and with the conversation we didn‚Äôt realize how long it took for our food to come until we looked at the time. I would definitely return.",4
It was fine but ambience a little lacking. We were seated in a high traffic even with a reservation  area but the young lady who served us was excellent,2
Why do you play very loud music in a restaurant that is set up for dining? We could not here ourselves think let alone talk with each other.,3
Friendly staff. Great steaks,4
"Had a table booked at 6pm - we were seated just after it. At around 6.20pm the waitress notified us that the kitchen was under pressure so food would be 45 minutes minimum!
this is info a host should share when seating guests. We ended up opting for soup so we could make our evening commitments on time",2
"I go to the Keg York Street for business lunches and dinners often but this time I was very disappointed.  I ordered the Seafood Trio, as I am on a specific diet, and it only came with 2 of the seafoods.  In addition, we arrived at 5:15 and our appetizers did not get to our table until 6:30! My guest and I were then late for our event that evening. 

I clicked ""Yes"" that I would recommend your location to a friend as there is no ""Maybe"" option.",1
Seven of us for lunch. Was very busy and took awhile to get our food. Totally understand and we were catching up so wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal. I ordered steak frites- steak was excellent but the frites were ice cold. Suspect that it had been sitting around until all the orders were ready. Mine was rare where the others ordered medium rare. We were seated at 12:15 and left a little after 2pm.,3
"Enjoyable occasion with old friends- everything went well from the reservation, to the seating location and arrangement, to the service, the food selection and pricing.",3
"Steak was full of gristle, the salad had no dressing  and the server kept reaching right across my face to top up my wine and blocking my conversatiom with my husband and my friend.  She should have pulled my glass towards her to fill it.",2
Very good spot.  All fantastic and great food. Just aa little noisy.,4
"My friend and I have been to this Keg restaurant several times.  It is convenient to all the theatres and concert halls so makes an easy option for dinner.  The food is always excellent, prepared just the way we like it.  The vegetables are fresh and cooked just the way we like, cooked but not overly so.  The Keg salads are always well chilled, fresh and crisp.  The meat is always delicious.",4
"Food was good, but lunch service is terribly slow.",2
"We waited over 45 minutes for our food to arrive (no appetizers) so we were quite rushed to eat. The excuse was that it was very busy but given it's the holidays and you know how busy you're going to be, I don't think that was really valid. Having said that, our server was very friendly and food was good.",1

"Always great food and great service , the lobster gratin and mushroom Neptune appetizers are always a great start, before anyone of their great meals",4
We showed up without a reservation and waited about 20 minutes. We were sat near a very large loud party of drinking guys and before we even ordered drinks the manager came over to ask us if we wanted another table. They seated us in a booth in another section. This is what I would call exceptional customer service. We were impressed and will definitely be back. Food was good as always.,4
"Nice atmosphere,  friendly staff,  food is good,  a bit expensive for the value.",4
"Server was excellent, atmosphere was terrific. Quite possibly the best steak I‚Äôve ever had, great taste and cooked to perfection.",4
"As usual, we were not disappointed. The food and service were excellent.",4
"The steaks were the worst my wife and I have had any Keg in over a decade of going to various locations. Both steaks were undercooked, they were tough, had more fat and waste than we've ever seen at any other Keg, and neither tasted like they had even been seasoned at all. We were genuinely surprised. The only thing that redeemed the meal was the stellar service and the honest attempt by the manager to make things right without even being asked. We simply cannot say enough about the quality of the service. That is the only reason I gave the meal an overall two star rating. The people there are that good.",1
"This particular Keg is the Flagship in the Chain and lives up to it's reputation that ""The Customer is No. 1"".

We enjoyed superb Steak & Seafood and our Server was excellent.

BRAVO !",4
"Overall good, dining room, qualifies food and beverages. Service was slower than usual especially the mains, took longer.",3
"Great experience, enjoyed a family holiday dinner and were very happy with the service and food.",4
We have never had a bad experience at the Keg. It‚Äôs so reliable. Great food and amazing value.,4
"This was our first visit to The Keg and we loved it! Wait staff was courteous, friendly and attentive. We had reservations and had to wait maybe 10 minutes when we arrived which was not a problem. We were given champagne and had our drinks ordered while we were waiting. 
My husband had the ‚Äúbaseball top‚Äù steak medium rare which was cooked to perfection. I had the seafood trio, lobster tail, king crab and a skewer with six large shrimps. We were pleased with the value and portions. The calamari appetizer was tasty with the sweet chili sauce hit if eaten with out the sauce the calamari itself was a little bland. 
We will definitely return on our next trip to Toronto. Unfortunately, we were too full to try one if their deserts but enjoyed the Tawny port.",4
"We don't like sitting in really close proximity to other tables and our hostess was very gracious in finding us a table along the front windows (exactly where we sat last time) which was much more to our liking. Our server and trainee were both very good. Pleasant, efficient and didn't rush us. A lovely experience for my birthday!",4
"Noise level made dinner almost unbearable 
Service at our table was fine but I saw a bunch of very glum looking employees going through the motions.",2
"Food was excellent, service great, staff friendly, but also polite. Good value. The restaurant was full and was a little too noisy for my taste. Overall it was a great experience",4
"Shannon was excellent, thank you.",4
Great. Fun time.,3
"It was busy that day and the amount of people contributed to the noise. As we got closer to the end of the meal, it got quieter. 

The server was excellent and helped us get two orders for something from the dinner menu. He also gave us honest recommendations for what to eat. 

It was a very good experience.",3
First time in my life I got the bill before the meal. And then no apology.,1
We had a really great experience today. The  wait staff was particularly attentive. Excellent!,4
Anniversary,4
"We had a great table and Jenna provided outstanding service.  Have to say the steaks seemed a bit smaller than I've had at the Keg before, but all in all a great night.",4
"Never been disappointed in a meal at the keg although it was definitely not the best outside cut of prime rib I have ever had...   the horseradish was incredibly good (almost blew my head off) and dessert was fabulous ... we lucked in to an outstanding, personable server.",4
Very disappointed,0
We made a reservation but still had to wait for a table.  Our server was not very friendly. We told her we were celebrating a birthday and she brought out our ordered dessert and forgot the birthday cake.  3 people in our party were ill that night.  Extremely disappointed since The Keg has been my favourite restaurant for 30 years.,2
"We loved our server, she was awesome, we will definitely come back.",4
Steak was cooked well this time. Salad and appetizers were excellent. Service was great .,3
"Very good food. Price is reasonable. Good size portions. The customer service is excellent, however it took a while for the food to come and my meat was medium well rather than medium rare as I asked. Overall I am satisfied and will come back soon.",3
"Steak was tough.  Couldn't even finish it!  Service was great, but was really looking forward to a nice steak.",2
"1 of the 3 steaks came out way under done. They tried to put it back  on the grill which resulted in a charred crust and still under done middle. Third try was better but still not great. The manager  came out and apologized and comped the 1 meal, which was nice. Service from the waiter was excellent. We've met friends there before  and have had a great time. Hopefully this was just a one-time issue.",2
We had a minor issue with the done-ness of the steak and the manager was very friendly and accommodating and resolved the issue right away. GREAT SERVICE!,4
Always on point.,4
Quality you can count on.,4
I come to this Keg location regularly and my prime rib meal was delicious as usual! Great service and quality!,4
"We had to wait 1/2 hr even though we had a reservation, but after that the service was pretty good. The restaurant was very busy but our food came out in decent time. The steaks were nicely prepared and the crab was delicious. .",4
"Our waitress, Aline was wonderful. But we had a 7pm reservation. When we arrived at the over-crowded restaurant, they simply gave me a buzzer, despite the fact that we had a reservation.. We were seated 30 minutes late, without any sort of apology. When they finally did take us to our table, it was a table for 2 people instead of for 3. We were left standing in the middle of the busy restaurant while the hostess left to figure things out. It was obvious they hadn‚Äôt kept our reservation. I think this was the case with other guests as well, since I saw a number of people speaking angrily with the manager. The restaurant was chaotic and unorganized. I will not return to this location.",2
"Habitually very busy, this place is known for its great stakes and elegant service. And we were not disappointed.",4
"Incredible service and the food was remarkably wonderful. Steak to perfection, great wine list, and comfortable ambiance.",4
"Enjoyable. Rarely disappointing. Always a good, reasonably priced place to go for a casual or specific occasion.",2
Food was delicious! No complaints.,4
"Good solid steak, food is great",4
The food was excellent. Our server was attentive but allowed us to have our conversation without interruption. The service was quick. Highly recommended.,4
"Boyfriend birthday 
We arrived late due to traffic to GTA but they were able to seat us ASAP 
I‚Äôm very pleased and my BF had a fabulous night 
Our waiter was outstanding",4
Server was very attentive. He noticed a birthday card on the table and commented. He then brought cake to the table for all of us to enjoy!,4
This location consistently exceeds my expectations and I always look forward to going there with clients or friends knowing that we will have first class food/drink and service.,4
My wife and I are big fans of the Keg but do not live close to one. We were excited to go to Keg in T.O for my Wife's 50 th birthday. The waitress was marvelous and fun. Andrew Bacon was very helpful as my Wife's first Moscow mule was missing ginger beer. He fixed and all was good. Our app of escargot was burnt and the legendary prime rib was not legendary. The wine and dessert were excellent.  Whatever New processes Keg management is using to make more money are diminishing the Keg tradition. Get back to serving quality and I mean top quality what the old Keg is know for. Not impressed. Elton John was great to make up this disappointment,2
"My daughter's prime rib was horrible.  The waitress should have been embarrassed to present that plate to my daughter and I immediately spoke up. My daughter said it was ""fine"". The waitress asked how everything is on our first bite and never came back again.
After about 4 bites my daughter gave up. The waitress came back at the end of the meal and there was still a big hunk of meat on her plate and said ""should I box it for you""? 
My daughter replied ""I don't think this was a good cut of meat"" (as it had a lot of white sinew in it).
The waitress then responded ""I wish you had told me that when I asked you how it was""? 
In my head I was thinking, I wish you checked in again before the meal was over.
The manager came over and was very pleasant, but it is not an inexpensive meal, and I feel a bit disenchanted.",1
The server and manager took celiac food allergy seriously and made an extra effort to answer any questions and concerns.  Had no bad reaction so everything was good.,4
Consistently excellent.,4
"Fried and burnt chicken, hard to eat. Swiss chalet makes it better.",2
Would've ordered apps but I'm allergic to seafood.,3
"Our server was very polite and well-mannered, but a bit slow in our opinion. But overall, good experience.",3
Excellent service. When I notified server regarding my gluten allergy she was well informed and even the manager came over to  reassure me. Food excellent!,3
Great food with a quiet beautiful ambience. Thank you,4
Food was incredibly salty - salt does not equate to flavor - it was bordering on ruining my $45 steak,2
"Server wasn‚Äôt attentive. Didn‚Äôt come back for water refills or another drink ask. Seemed very busy and stretched too thin with more customers than his ability. 

Horseradish extremely strong and dry 

Steaks were excellent",1
Our Server Stephanie was excellent! She remembered what we like and brought our hot water with lemon and honey without asking! Food was excellent as usual. Highly recommended.,4
The Keg York St never disappoints. Excellent prime rib.,4
Great place to celebrate 25 years of Marriage,4
Great Service. Great food.,4
"We were running late and they held the table for us,  very much appreciated",4
Great food and great place to get together with friends,4
The Keg is very consistent.  The food and service are always good and the atmosphere varies from location to location.  We sat on the restaurant side and it was quiet enough to have a conversation.  The Keg remains one of our 'go to' places for steak before the theatre.,3
As always....superb!,4
Great gluten free choices. Price was under $100 for 2 with a bottle of wine and tip.,4
"Great ambience, friendly servers. The wine selection was great and the specials were truly enticing.",4
Great place to take a customer. Things are reasonably priced and delicious!,4
"Unfortunately I was not overly impressed with the presentation of food.  Meals were tasty but appetizers, entree and dessert were not presented as nice as I‚Äôve seen in smaller Keg locations.  We sat with finished plates in front of us for a long time, our waitress was training a young lady but the attention to our table seemed to be missed.",2
"Excellent service 
This is my favourite location",4
Really good food and service,4
It was simply amazing the service was excellent and the food was simply mind blowing!!! Love it and made the birthday special with surprise free bday cake!! Overall fabulous experience!!! :),4
Waited 1 min for our booked table. Food was very good. You must try the garlic toast as a starter - v v good! Steak was cooked to perfection.  Our server was brilliant in helping us decide on the menu choice.  I would suggest sharing a starter as the portions are very generous.,4
Consistently good food and service. Celebrating our anniversary. The complimentary dessert was appreciated.,4
"All around great. Food and service number 
Was my wife‚Äôs 60 bday and she said it was the best !!!!!!!!!!",4
Great atmosphere for a date night but also very fun and entertaining as the night goes on as there are different seating areas that can cater to all crowds. Food excellent as always. Waiter was humble and attentive.,4
Anniversary,3
"Great food and good location
Great location, food and atmosphere.  The wait staff are experienced and very nice.",4
We had a delicious meal @ The Keg.,4
Birthday dinner out of town. Great service and fantastic food.,4
Had a problem with one of our entree orders. Manager very attentive and corrected situation in matter of minutes. Other than that food was very good. Service also very good. Would highly recommend this restaurant.,3
"Very deceiving from the outside - this is a restaurant with depth, warmth and great service staff.

Menu choice was wide, but not extreme, allowing for focused decisions. Everything was superbly cooked - I had the French onion soup followed by the rib steak - both superb. 

But it‚Äôs the staff that make this place special. From hostess to waiting staff, these guys really know how to have a professional but light relationship that makes the meal just flow. Unobtrusive but alert, some of the best in the business in relaxed dining. 

Will be back the next time I‚Äôm in Toronto!",4
The absolute most delicious keg meal we have ever had!! The waiter was amazing and the atmosphere was perfect!,4
Pre-opera dinner date.,4
"Thanks Oliver !! You were awesome , very good service !!",3
"Great food - crappy service. The waitress displayed an attitude that got worse the longer we stayed. When I pointed out to her that had she showed a better attitude her tip would have been better, her response was not an apology, it was this. ‚ÄúDo you want to speak to a manager?‚Äù She repeated that line aggressively twice and then upon hearing ‚ÄúNo‚Äù from me, turned and walked away. Perhaps she should be subjected to a customer service refresher.",2
The arugula was limp and there were far too many pumpkin seeds and dried cranberries in the salad.  Service was very friendly and helpful.,3
"Really nice meat and really tasty. Still for a Steakhouse the ""Steak choice"" remains quite limited. I haven't found any dry aged piece of meat offered in the menu for example.
All in all the quality of served food was good though.
Service was OK, whereas the personal was rather distant and not really friendly. Busy evening?",3
"What you would expect from any steakhouse. Good steaks, but not the best I've ever had.",2
"Great Food and Superb Service, keeps us coming back to this venue.

A hit with all of our Clients.

Bravo !",4
Steak was raw. We cannot share more than 2 people for a bottle of water was disappointing.  Service was just okay.,2
"All around great place. Perfect mix of classy and casual. Fancy enough for any occasion but not ridiculously over priced and snooty. We celebrated our anniversary here and enjoyed the menu, drinks, and atmosphere. Would highly recommend",4
Consistently great at York St Keg! Only comments for improvement: hostess staff could do a better job of welcoming guests. Seems strange to be told to wait when arriving a few minutes early for a 5:45 reservation when many empty tables are available.,4
Great spot as always. Steaks were excellent. Wine was great. Service was awesome.,4
"I had lunch to celebrate my friend's birthday - we had a terrific server who was friendly and efficient.  My friend had the Caesar salad with steak and she said it was delicious.  I loved my tuna tartare - it comes with avocado and homemade tortilla chips (not sure that's exactly what they are called, but they were tasty).  The server surprised my friend with a Happy Birthday and Billy Miner pie which was definitely large enough for us to share.  Great lunch!",3
Nothing to add just excellent. Service was very good and after mentioning that it was our honeymoon the dessert was on the chef. Thanks again!,4
"A truly great Venue, that prides itself on consistency.
From the warm greeting at the FOH to great service (By our Server, Katie); made it yet another
enjoyable visit to Le Keg.

BRAVO !",4
Always a pleasure dining here. Good atmosphere and friendly servers. Tonight my entree was delayed but the manager came over to explain about Saturday night and afterwards another manager checked up to see if I was enjoying the dish and apologized again. Very good service.,4
Simply one of the best meals I‚Äôve ever had.  Steak was amazing and cooked to perfection.  Our waiter was great. Truly a great meal.,4
"For was tasteful, one of the best steaks I‚Äôve had at the keg. Unfortunately it took 15 minutes from the time i was seated for a waiter to come to take our order/get us some water",3
Excellent prime rib,4
I always have a great time when I go to The Keg! The customer service is always great and so is the food.,4
Wow. What an amazing dinner. The steak was cooked to perfection.  The service was incredible. I could not recommend this restaurant enough. So enjoyable. We will be back!!! Thanks for taking such good care of us.,4
"Waitress was attentive, courteous, friendly and surprised us with a delicious dessert because we were celebrating a special occasion. The food was delicious. The steak done to perfection",4
Excellent food and atmosphere!  You won't be disappointed by the food.,4
"Friendly staff, good food, great location.  I'd certainly recommend it",3
"the table was not comfortable.  The banquette was too low for the table and there was a wall that protruded into my space, making it uncomfortable.  Consider removing this table as a possible seating area.... or moving it away from the wall/pillar to allow the person sitting more space.

Very noisy!  But way better than a lot of other restaurants.",2
Volume of music was too loud on the patio!,3
Great place to go for steak.  Great service in the bar/lounge area.,4
Wonderful from start to finish! Best steak everrrr,4
Steaks were well cooked and flavorful. Desserts were very good. Wait staff was friendly.,4
Vacation and anniversary,2
Matt was awesome and made it fun. Food was great. Love the Summer Lobster event!,4
"Service was excellent. The meal was delicious, cooked and presented well",4
Excellent lunch out on the patio. Service was fast and the food was really good!,4
"Service made the experience.  The food is always good, but the server took it next level!",4
"Got the steak wrong twice, slow service poorly timed.",0
We enjoyed our meal at The Keg! Service was excellent. Just small critique; the halibut was a bit dry.,3
"Consistent and repeatable food and service and a good price.  And we discovered the courtyard patio, which was great on a summer evening.",3
The Keg is a geat place for a nice steak dinner. Yummy food as always! ;),4
Great service and always great food. We had an issue with our meal and it was handled beautifully. Would definitely come here again!,4
"Jamie, our server, was great and attentive. My partner has allergies and we were able to communicate it Jamie, the kitchen crew, as well as the restaurant manager. Have been coming to this location every year because of their service. Thank you again!",4
Great steaks in a busy downtown venue. Great introduction to a North American restaurant concept,3
We had a fantastic meal and a lovely birthday experience!,4
Everything was perfect,4
"Phoned and asked Joan to change our reservation from two to three people. When we arrived this had not been done. Told the receptionist that the third person would arrive soon and gave a description and name. The person waited 40 minutes, then phoned us. The reception said we had not arrived yet. Easy job, not busy. You have a problem.",3
"That steak frites for main course was literally terrible. 
It was more like a joke.. so unflavoured and not marinated and BURNT!!!

Calamari for appetizer was not what I was expected but still ok..

Cheese cake was good. But coffee was ridiculously cold!!

I paid 100$ just for eating cheese cake!! I left that steak almost intake",0
"Under construction on outside - so a little difficult to find.

Put in a room by ourselves for entire meal - odd.

Server got 4 tables all at once but he did his best.",3
"Great find on OpenTable! Had the crab cakes and was disappointed as they mostly seemed like filler for the price. My filet was very well cooked, tender and juicy. I had the twice backed potato, which was average. My wife had the filet and twin lobster tails, which were nicely cooked and tender. Overall, I‚Äôd go back for the steak and try different accompaniment options. Would recommend and great location.",3
Ottimo lobster e ottima carne unico neo tendono a cuocere la carne un po‚Äô troppo ( a noi e‚Äô successo entrambe le volte ) ma si rendono disponibili a rifarla ( x evitare sprechi meglio scegliere la cottura piu‚Äô al sangue .... personale disponibile prezzo adeguato,3
"Great place to enjoy ""Toronto"". A true Toronto institution, great vibe, excellent steaks and good service from the moment you walk in the door to the last nite of food.",4
Completely in line with what you would expect from eating at The Keg! We had a nice time,3
"We enjoyed the outstanding food  and great service.
Our steaks were cooked perfectly to our request.
We will definitely return the next time we are in Toronto!",4
Food and service was great! A thoroughly enjoyable lunch experience.,4
"Sat outside in the back, nice music and decor out there. Sounds of street and construction of course because we're outside downtown. Two buildings beside under construction. Steaks were good but not as good as my boyfriend's steak lol but service was awesome server was nice and had great suggestions. I found blue ink on my steak and they made me a whole new plate. They didn't charge me for my steak and I even got free calamari while I waited for the new plate. Manager was very courteous.",4
"Service was really slow, not very busy and it took extremely long to get our food",1
Steaks were prepared precisely and service was attentive. Provided a little birthday slice of pie for us at no cost. Nice little touch. All diners this Saturday night seemed happy and the whole place was a fun vibe.,3
Great patio and the food is good quality.  Always a good experience at the Keg on York Street.,4
The food was outstanding.  I can‚Äôt remember a meal that I enjoyed as much as that one.,4
"So I had an issue with my meal - I ordered a burger during a relatively empty restaurant. The burger was burnt, the bun was oily and cold, the fries were soggy and old. If this is the food quality during a dead lunch, imagine what you would get during a heavy rush. Unfortunately not on par with other restaurants in a similar price range, and not on par with other Keg restaurants I have been too. Quite disappointed.",2
Awesome meal. Great steak and lobster and wonderful dessert. Very nice ambiance for our anniversary meal.,4
"It was awesome!! we had someone at our table with a tree but allergy and they took it seriously to ensure a stress free experience!! The wine, bread, appetizers, filet mignon  with king crab dishes and fillet Oscar were all amazing!! Just an overall fabulous experience!!

Oh dessert was great too!

Your friends from USA",4
Great place to eat..service quality was excellent,4
Food quality not at the same quality as other Keg restaurants.  Very disappointing.,1
"We ate outside.  Beautiful restaurant, great staff. Service was amazing. Food was delicious.",4
Nice booth and it wasn‚Äôt noisy.  Food was excellent and we had non pushy attentive wait staff.  Looking forward to dining there again next month!,4
"Sam was absolutely amazing! She was friendly, efficient, and so knowledgeable. She made sure that we understood all of the specials, and even offered better values than what we thought we were getting. The food at the Keg was perfectly cooked. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for better.",4
"Best Patio in T.O.
Awesome food (With steaks done to perfection), combined with superb service, is what keeps us coming back.
Our International Clients rave about this venue and insist on revisiting.

BRAVO !",4
"The keg is always great! The service was quick, and pleasant. The food was amazing. Definitely a good place to get a good piece of meat. Don‚Äôt go if you‚Äôre on a budget though!",4
Excellent meal and good service...,3
"It was very good. Our waitress was excellent as were any of the other staff we encountered, but she was special.",3
"Absolutely one of the nice dinners we have had at the Keg, Stefano was a pleasure to have as a server. We will definitely be back again!!",4
Lovely food and amazing service. We came here for the last night of our honeymoon and had the best time! We were given a free piece of coffee cake which was sensational!,4
Service was very slow...a big time gap between our salads and actually getting our filets.  When we got the steaks they had absolutely no juice and were dry and overdone.  I suspect the steaks were cooked properly but they  sat under a heat lamp or something like that...the plates were extremely hot further cooking the steaks.  It was very disappointing given the fact that we brought people from out of town there!  Best part if the meal was the baked potato...sad.,2
Our waiter was Stephano & was very knowledgeable & great service& pleasant,4
"Had an overall wonderful experience!  We went for an early dinner before the Michael Buble concert (fantastic). 

The food was phenomenal! The bread and Crab cakes yummy. Filet mignon was cooked just right. The lobster tails were delicious too! 

Our server,Jaime, was great and extremely nice!
Highly recommend.",4
"We love dining at the Keg. That being said, the music was way too loud during our dinner. We felt the volume was more appropriate for a nightclub or bar- not enjoyable for having a nice meal. We were there one week earlier as well. Same loud music, although the 2nd visit seemed louder possibly due to where we were seated. This definitely detracted from our overall experience.",3
"Sam took great care of us! She was there when needed and kept us happy with wine and food recommendations and even a free dessert since we were ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù visitors! Highly recommend the prime rib and the filet. Also don‚Äôt pass up the Miners Pie. I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called. Their signature. You will not be disappointed but bring a friend! It‚Äôs huge! Great experience all the way around! Food, ambience and service! Fantastic date night for the wife and I.
Would definitely go beach if ever in Toronto again!",4
Of course we ordered the prime rib üòÅ. It was amazing! Save room for dessert üòã,4
Really enjoyed my time. Thank you to team on helping me with my marriage proposal at the restaurant.,4
Service was really really bad. Took over 30 minutes to get server over to pay bill. Neglected all night. Meat way way over cooked.,2
Tr√®s bon repas pour souligner l‚Äôanniversaire de ma fille avant d‚Äôaller voir un spectacle au th√©√¢tre.  √áa a bien d√©but√© la soir√©e.  Tout √©tait parfait,4
"It was the birthday of one person in our group.  This was mentioned in the reservation, at other kegs, a dessert has been given to the birthday person.  2 of the steaks were over cooked.  All 3 steaks that were ordered medium were cooked differently. One was medium, one was medium well, and one was well done.",3
Excellent meal.  Took 2 small kids and options for them were great.,4
"Food above average, my rib  steak was superb, service very professional, ambience only so so, noice level high and we had to speak up .",3
"Excellent venue, excellent meal and excellent service.  We had tickets for the theater and our server made sure our meal was promptly delivered and she made sure we were on time for the show! And we did not feel rushed in any way!",4
"For the price not what I would have expected from a very nice steak house. 
I would not recommend as the food, service, drinks were below average.",1
"Started out really well. Greeted us, seated us and took and deliver our appetizer order right off the bat. Waited and waited and waited for our entree. When it finally arrived I had ordered a14oz prime rib and looked like I received a 7oz prime rib. Lady in charge of tables apologized for the delay. Offered us cheesecake to make up for the poor service.  Something happened in the kitchen I‚Äôm sure, but no excuse. Our reservations were at 7:00. We left the Keghouse at 8:30.  Doubt we will give them a second chance.",2
Amazing service and great food. Highly recommend.,4
"Great overall, as always!!!",4
Love the Keg.  Was there with my son who has a gluten allergy and they bent over backward to accommodate him and make sure we knew they took it seriously.  Add to that the consistently great food at reasonable prices and attentive service and you‚Äôve got one extremely happy customer.  Well done Keg!,4
Good happy hour wines,4
Excellent service wonderful experience for our 43rd wedding anniversary.   Nicole was our waitress and she was fabulous.,4
The Keg never fails! Their steaks are always cooked to perfection and this time I got a half lobster which tasted amazing! And the portion was the perfect amount! 5 Stars!,4
I really liked the place ... I enjoyed my calendar starter most. it was a nice place for me to read and eat.,4
The lady at the entrance was kind of rude and weird. I had to wait 11 minutes despite having a reservation,2
"This was our first ever visit to The Keg.  We were most impressed about the menu that all the choices showed how many calories they contained.  It certainly makes you think about what you are putting into your body and it actually did help in deciding what to order.  I believe it is a good thing to have an informed choice and think many more restaurants should follow suit with this.  The service was ok not too hot.  The food was good about what we expected.  It¬¥s not fine dining, but the standard of food was acceptable and the restaurant comfortable if not a little too cold with the air con.  I would recommend this restaurant.",3
"First time in this restaurant, delicious food and perfect service!",4
Waited over 40 minutes for our food order to arrive.  This was a birthday lunch for my wife and was indicated in the reservation.  I have been to this location before and this was the worst.,0
Wonderful evening - getting together and celebrating a milestone birthday!,4
"Been to the York Street Keg many times at least 4 or 5 times a year for different occasions. They never fail to impress. Always enjoy my time there with family, colleagues or friends.",4
Whenever we visit Toronto we are sure to stop by our favorite restaurant.  It was a great dinner to celebrate husbands birthday,4
Amazing server! Mini creme br√ªl√©e was delicious,4
"I was unfortunately disappointed in some of the service we received.  We arrived early enough so it was not very busy. We advised we were not in a rush and had a show to go to at 8. The waiter was constantly at the table, asking us if we wanted to order or bringing something or moving things around. i asked for the sirloin and got the prime rib. It took 10 minutes for someone to come by and by that point i had pretty much finished so I told them not to bother changing it.  I was very disappointed. I felt that we were constantly being bothered and rushed, except when i got the wrong food, then it was crickets....quiet.
It was our anniversary and I mentioned this to the waiter and included it in my reservation but we were not offered any Billy Miner Pie (perhaps they don't do that anymore).  Very disappointing for an anniversary dinner.",2
"We have always liked the Keg so chose this restaurant for our wedding anniversary meal that fell whilst we were holidaying in Toronto, but we wished we hadn‚Äôt. 

The atmosphere was flat and totally dull, the food was OK but certainly nothing to write home about and we kept getting asked by two different waiting staff about our order like they didn‚Äôt talk to each other. 

All in all it was a waste of time and very expensive for what we got. We won‚Äôt be back and won‚Äôt be recommending the place to anyone!",1
Asked for a semi private table. Was told nothing is private. Felt embarrassed in front of my guest. Host didn‚Äôt make any efforts to even try and help,0
Waiter was attentive,4
"Good was good and served as expected 
Good value for money",3
"Been to two other Keg locations before and not been disappointed.
However this time:
We could only get a 9.30 reservation despite most of the restaurant being empty - detracted from the atmosphere
My girlfriend's steak was ordered medium rare and came medium well - this is a pretty big change but to their credit they did remove from the bill. 
Overall everything else was in keeping with the high standards I have found at Keg previously",3
The server was fantastic and the steak was good. The mushrooms were dry and shrivelled and the veg and potatoes were dry. Love the atmosphere though.,2
"Whenever I visit Toronto, I always spend one evening at the Keg. I believe their quality is great, as well as their service. This time I had a Tuna Tartare as appetizer and a nice filet mignon wrapped with bacon. It was a real experience for me. The dinner ended with a great cake to indulge with. Prices are in line with the marketplace. Highly recommended.",3
"Service was terrible last week, servers and bartenders in the bar area and on the patio seemed to be distracted by each other and their visiting friends. Had to wave someone down even for the bills. Other times the service is typically excellent. Food wasn't as goid either. I still love and would recommend the location. Probably just an off night.",1
"This location has great service, and amazing staff.",4
"Wait time for service, food and pretty much everything was far too long.",1
"Perfect in every way!!!!!
Retirement lunch for a co-worker and we had a great time.",4
Two birthdays.,4
Always an amazing experience at York St Keg...back patio is great in the summer!,4
Raptors parade,4
We always enjoy eating at the Keg.  The staff is always friendly and helpful and the food choices are varied.  The quality and presentation is excellent.,4
This is our ‚Äúgo to‚Äù place when we stay in Toronto and it never disappoints! We will be back!,4
"Awesome on so many levels.
From the warm greeting at the FOH and throughout the entire dining experience.",4
We were there starting at 5:30 pm right through to the end of the Raptors game at 11:30 pm Our service and food were great and the atmosphere in the lounge was energetic and a great location to enjoy the game,3
"Great service and lovely food, ambience slightly disrupted by a rogue busker!",4
"Great Food and Excellent Service.
Many thanks to our Servers (Katie and Kurt) who made our dining experience special.
My Client from Ireland was especially impressed with the way that his steak was done
to his exact specification....BRAVO!",4
"Service was excellent, and food and drinks were good!",4
"We rquested a private table for a quiet birthday celebration, and that was just what we got.  Every part of the meal was fantastic, from the Caesar salad and calamari to the steaks.  I had the NY Strip, which was delicious and cooked to perfection; my husband had the filet, which I tasted and can say it was the most tender cut I have ever eaten.  The cocktails were great, and, to top it off, they surprised me with a slice of their famous mocha ice cream pie. I highly recommend The Keg and will definitely return!",4
"It was my partners birthday, I asked for something small to commemorate the occasion however it simply felt like a everyday lunch. Otherwise it was a good everyday steak lunch.",3
"We arrived at the reservation time. The hostess welcomed us with a friendly smile on the face. Then we were served by a server, her service was excellent and she was able to take order and serve food at a reasonable pace. The food tastes wonderful as well! I've ordered Steak and shrimp and my boyfriend got the baseball sirloin. They were freshly picked and well cooked  by the chef. Overall I really enjoyed this anniversary experience and will definitely come back again!",4
"As always The Keg proves itself again to be my favourite place to eat.

The steaks are consistently the best I‚Äôve ever tasted, anywhere in the world.

I cannot recommend this, or indeed any Keg, highly enough.",4
Food was great and our waitress was constantly checking in on us. Love it!,4
"super great! Will recommend to everyone. Good price, excellent place and menu",4
"Prime rib was cold and over cooked. 
Great location and server was so so.
Offered bread after eaten the appetizers.",1
Excellent food. Indoors was a little dark so we opted for the patio which although undergoing construction around it was a great choice in the good weather. Music a little loud but not intrusive. Friendly professional staff.,3
Good place to get some stake and enjoy an nice twice baked potato.,4
"Excellent service, amazing drinks and delicious food!",4
"We really enjoyed our dinner at the Keg! We hadn‚Äôt been in years and the food and ambiance was great. Our waitress, Miranda, was just incredible! She made all the right recommendations and suggestions we were looking for!  She was friendly and patient and made us feel so special!! Thanks again Miranda for an incredible evenings!!
We‚Äôll be sure to return real soon!
Dolores and Loreto",4
"This particular Keg location always lives up to it's reputation of being 'Customer Focussed'.

On this particular visit, there was an issue with a Prime Rib order and within minutes,
the Food and Beverage Manager approached us (In person) and went the extra mile
to take corrective action....BRAVO !

We will continue to support this Venue and most of our international clients have
very fond experiences of their multiple visits to Le Keg.

Slainte !",4
"i attend there regularly for lunch meetings and I am never disappointed
Food and service are consistently excellent  reception at the door most pleasant
I will continue to be a regular patron",4
It‚Äôs always our first choice for dinners out and famJams,4
The steak was exactly what I had in mind and really delicious. I'm always impressed at the evolving menu. For such a large organization they seem to keep the menu fresh by constantly tinkering at the edges. We had the crudo for the first time and it was fantastic.,4
37th wedding anniversary,4
No complaints. Great food and service and great place to go.,4
"Out visit to The Keg York Street was excellent.  The service was amazing.  I would like to commend our Waitress, Stephanie (Stef).  She is amazing.  Also we had slight issue with our food and it was quickly resolved to our satisfaction.  Would highly recommend The Keg, York Street.  and ask for table in Stef's area!!!  You won't be disappointed.",4
We had a great time celebrating my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday. The service was great. I will surely return to Toronto and eat at the Keg.,4
"I know that The Keg isn't exactly fine dining, but it can usually be counted on for consistency and predictability at the higher end of the casual restaurant scale. During this visit, however, the service was distracted and hurried, the food was presented fairly poorly and, in one case, not to-order, and the bathroom was filthy with waste (of both kinds). The soap dispenser was broken, too - not a big deal, but a reflection of the surprising shoddiness of the whole experience. Weird.",2
"Brenna, our server was amazing!",4
"Fantastic service!  Consistently high quality food, never disappoints!",4
"We had problems with our food which was taken care of very well.
Happy about the visit",4
Excellent service for someone who has a food allergy!,4
Everything was great!,4
Food and ambience was fantastic as always! We will definitely be back when the borders open back up!,4
"While not our first Keg experience, it was our first time at this Keg location and we had an awesome experience. Our server was great with assisting in our wine selection and brought us samples to taste to ensure we enjoyed our selection!",3
Pretty good steak the ambience is casual definitely a good place for a casual dinner.,4
"Server Nicole M was excellent.  Was enjoying a catch up  conversation with a colleague and Nicole paced her service accordingly.  Food was good but twice baked potatoes were burnt on top not a good look when presented. Keg at York has lots of competing venues for the ""expense account"" diners so we who pay our own way still look to the Keg to welcome all age demographics (as well as families, tourists) with options at all price points even during the high traffic hours weekdays between 5-7:30 pm.",3
"Very much enjoyed my meal.  I had a poorer cut of steak and was worried that it might be tough; waitress told me all their meats are tender.  Sure enough the steak was cooked just right and sure enough tender and favorable.  My brother had their burger and told me it was pretty good.
Funny thing is the restaurant e-mailed me the next day wondering why we did not show up. UH...;we were there on time told them our name and they escorted us to our table.",3
"Bien , buena actitud",3
"Our food was delish!!  My steak was cooked well and my crab was sweet and a nice a treat.  However, about 4 hours after dinner I started getting sick.  So I'm not sure if it was from the steak, crab or asparagus that I ate, but unfortunately it will be a long time before i go back to The Keg again.",3
Great food. Our server was very efficient and friendly,4
Amazing Experience. Service was exceptional.,4
Recommended,4
"We had drinks in the bar next to the fireplace, a lovely bottle of wine and a delicious meal.  We can‚Äôt find one thing to complain about!  It was the perfect wedding celebration :)",4
Always great,4
"Great place, great food and great service. Whether your going for a date or a group it‚Äôs a no brainer.",4
"Great experience at this Keg as usual.

We had prompt service for cocktails and appetizers at the bar, and were then moved to a booth where we were immediately served.  Fabulous wine recommendation by the Manager.  Great serving sizes for the prime rib and halibut dishes.  We will be back!",4
"Pretty overpriced. Also, the staff was not accommodating with a gift certificate issue. I also don't like the feeling that the seating staff size up people's appearance and decide where to seat them accordingly.",2
"the most important test is the food, if that's rubbish it doesn't matter how good everything else is, food matters.

the food here was incredible, I like a good steak, but the cut, the cook and the presentation followed by the taste meant this was a great steak.

our server was polite, attentive but not instrusive .

you pay for quality but a meal for 2, couple drinks each, desert each cost just over $110, which I think is very reasonable. would recommend.",4
"Made a reservation on open table and said it was a birthday but at the restaurant they didn't look up the reservation as received an email while dining that I was a no show.  We didn't care for the first table they gave us, second was fine.  Food was good although the salads could use more dressing or spicing as they are rather bland.  Server was just okay at best.   Next time I think we'll choose a different location.",2
"We were late and pressed for time since we were going to a show. We had a reservation and were seated immediately. I explained our hurry to our waitress who recommended the roast beef since it was always ready and could be served quickly. It was served quickly, but the quality was less than what I would have expected. Very fatty. 

Good service, OK ambience, and OK food.",2
"Very enjoyable experience.   Easy to make a reservation and everything was ready for us when we arrived - no waiting.  Washroom very clean.
Our reservation was for 5 and the noise level was very subdued.  It got a little noisier as we approached  6 o'clock.  But still within reason.
Fortunately no screaming kids.",4
Great experience at this location as always. Thank you.,4
"Great Food combined with Superb Service, makes this place a winner.

The Staff is focussed on Customer Service and aim to please.

Looking forward to better weather and the re-opening of T.O's # 1 Patio Bar.


BRAVO !",4
"Overall, great food and service.  Our server disappeared at the end which made it difficult to pay and leave in a timely fashion.",3
"I've been to the Keg numerous times, and it's always consistent when it comes to the quality of the food...which is great!  What isn't consistent is the service.  And when you compare it to other restaurants particularly steakhouses, it falls short.",3
"Was very underwhelmed by my Birthday dinner at this Keg.
Both our Caesar Salads came with verg little dressing. Many end pieces. Those pieces already turning brown and we were there at 4pm when the place opened.
My steak on the side of my salad was good. Our baked shrimp was amazing. 
His Baseball Sirloin was way undercooked.  Sent back. But still came back again undercooked.",2
Food was great.  Enjoyed our meal.  Wait staff responsive friendly and helpful.,4
Can‚Äôt go wrong with the Keg.,4
Great dinner,4
Efficient and friendly service. One of my favorite locations.,4
My wife and I visited the Keg before attending the show Come from Away and enjoyed our meal very much. Our Server Britney was extremely friendly and attentive. We will certainly visit this restaurant again.,4
Got a great table and easy reservation through OpenTable. Service was great and food was delicious although the final bill is high when drinks and full meal with appetizers are added. Nice for special occasions!,4
"The food was awesome. Personnel was very polite, corteous, but restaurant is fully booked and crowded. You cannot show up and get a table.",3
Amazing food and incredible service. We wish we lived closer to downtown to utilize this location more. Would definitely recommend. Try the garlic cheese bread.,4
"My partner and I came to celebrate our 3 year anniversary. We booked online which was simple and easy. When we arrive the host was extremely polite and courteous, he offered to take our coats and place them in cost check. He then showed us to our table all within around 2-3 minutes of arriving. Our Server, Catherine, came across and greeted us with a smile not long after we sat down. Without going in to full details of the night, Catherine was superb. She was friendly, polite, never too far away. She helped make our night a great one. Along with a lovely bottle of red and some fantastic food. I had the New York peppercorn and my partner had chicken and ribs. No complaints at all regarding any part of our night, just praise, praise and more praise for the host, server and kitchen.",4
Overall a good meal with attentive service.,3
"Great service, marcelous ambiance and excellent Prime rib",3
"Good food, good service, ambiance could stand the refreshed and upgraded.",3
Delicious food and ambiance. Would highly recommend!,4
"Atmosphere was great, food was delicious and our waitress was very friendly not too overbearing and also checked in at the right time. Would definitely go back to this Keg location.",4
Love the food and service. Definitely add this to one of my to go  üëçüëç,4
I have been to this location many times but this time before a show with my son.  Service was slow (expected because the place was packed) but also mediocre.  Drinks were delivered 15 mins after we ordered.  Steaks were not cooked to order and when they were returned to us 10 minutes later they had reversed the food on the plates.  Manager stopped by but didn‚Äôt say much.  We were not being difficult - didn‚Äôt get upset or raise our voices - we smiled and were easygoing because we had a few minutes to enjoy ourselves.   When we declined dessert we were handed the bill two minutes later without the offer of coffee or something else to drink.  Altogether disappointed.,2
"The food was phenomenal, the service was great and the atmosphere was just fantastic. Would defnitely go again.",4
"It's the Monday of the long weekend (Family Day) and what better way to treat the entire Family , but to take the whole gang to The Keg
AND
We were not disappointed.


Great Food and Superb Service, will keep us coming back to this Venue.

Slainte !",4
Food and service was exceptional,4
"This was my first time at this Keg and it did not disappoint. 
The atmosphere was lovely and sophisticated. 
Our waitress (I think her name was Amy) was a pure delight. She was friendly, informative and very attentive. 
At the beginning of our meal she asked my husband and I if we were celebrating anything special and we told her we were celebrating being kid free for the weekend. At the end of our meal she was kind enough to bring us each a glass of champagne (wonderful surprise). When she brought us our bill we noticed she also wrote off our dessert. She did not have to do any this and yet she went out of her way to make us feel special. That kind of customer service is very rare now a days. 
Overall my husband and I had a great dining experience at the Keg (York Street) and look forward to coming back again when we have another kid free night/weekend :)",4
Great experience. Always consistently good food at great value. And we absolutely love the Billy Miner Pie!,4
"Not as good as it used to be. Fish & chips failed. Fish was soggy, fries tasteless. Reception service was non existent.",2
"Had exceptional service, and the food was amazing as usual!",4
"I‚Äôve been to this location twice, last time was better. Perhaps it was just an off night. The fire element (why we chose this location) was turned off halfway through our meal, our server was too busy and one of our appetizers came out after we had finished our meals. Our server was pleasant though when we did have her attention. Still, I will always recommend The Keg because nobody can do a better steak!",3
Service was fast and efficient. The steak was cooked to my specifications and the spice on it was perfect.,3
Great service and the food was amazing. I will definitely come  back to this location. I highly recommend this place to everyone.,4
Excellent service - we especially appreciated our server Drew and the manager Mr. Bacon who stopped by our table several times to ensure we had a great experience.  Food was excellent.  A+,4
"Yet another ‚ÄòFine Dining Experience‚Äô at the Keg.
This is definitely our ‚ÄúGO TO LOCATION‚Äù and our growing list of Clientele tend to agree.
Once again, we opted to dine at the Bar and we were not disappointed.
Kurt (The Bartender) was excellent and took great care of us.
His knowledge of Food and Wine Pairings is extensive and his suggestions were terrific.
BRAVO!",4
Great value in a very comfortable setting. Nice balance between a 'happening' vibe with the privacy to talk at the table without others too close. We asked to be served quickly and they did. a great spot before a hockey  or basketball game.,3
Muy bueno como todos los KEG  y amplio horario de servicio.,4
The staff was very kind and food was excellent.,4
"I just love this restaurant and her food. Try to go there every time im in To. Our waiter was super polite and nice (and unfortunately I don‚Äôt remember his name..), the wines assorted is pretty rich and the food is great.
One thing that bothered me was that I ordered baked brie and it was taking almost 25 mins to be served. It was obvios that it get burned or something like that and still the waiter just said after 20 mins it would be longer than usual today, and the restaurant wasn‚Äôt too full.

Overall perfect value for money.",4
I Love this location. It's large but still feels intimate. My only issue is that sound travels a lot (it's loud) and it can get really cold in the back.,3
"We had an excellent dinner (as usual) and our server was gracious, funny and friendly. We always make a stop at The Keg when we are in Toronto",4
Service was fabulous and excellent food. One of our favorites!,4
Great service by our server Suzanna,4
this should be optional al....no I interest in writing a review.,4
"The fresh baked bread was a great start to our meal which ended with a shared Billy Miner dessert, mmmm good. I  asked for medium steak cook, it was perfectly so. Baked potato was the right size and once again cooked just right. A shared Caesar salad, very tasty with just the right amount of dressing. My lunch companions had prime rib and this was cooked exactly to their taste. Serving staff were so friendly and attentive to our needs. Thoroughly enjoyable meal, we will be back......",3
Disappointed cauliflower steak taken off the lunch menu!,4
Good old Keg. Steak was great. Sangria was good. The prime rib sliders were a pleasant surprise.,3
"Todo un acierto para una ocasi√≥n especial. La carne es incre√≠ble, aunque los acompa√±amientos decepcionaron un poco... el servicio, de 10. Para repetir",4
Best value. Quality menu. The steak and food is consistent every time. Consistent between locations. Easy to get a reservation or option to  dine in the lounge area. The steak is as good or better than some of the high-end steak houses in the city but at affordable prices.  I've been supporting the Keg for over 20 years. You will always get my business!!!,4
The Keg is consistent. The food always taste wonderful. I been going to the Keg for 38 years. I still enjoy the food. Keep up the good work.,3
"We all had a lovely dinner. Everything was fine. Except for babies / toddlers crying right near us. it was my birthday dinner .
Our suggestion would be to lump,families with babies / toddlers in one section and not all over the place ( crying, running around)",3
Lovely food and great service from Drew for a nice family New Year meal including having a little one with us who was well looked after,4
"The service was great. Our waitress was amazing. Overall, a great experience!",4
"This review would have been a 5 if not for the annoying music. Listening to ""Edgar Winter Frankenstein "" was ridiculous and annoying for such a dark cozy steakhouse. Most of the music was totally wrong for the ambiance. Do yourselves a favour and run a nice Jazz chanel. You can't go wrong. Food was awesome and waitress was great. Don't ruin it with loud obnoxious music.

Cheers,

Dean Stevens",2
Would be nice if a Jaeger-bomb was something more than a tumbler with Jeager in it and a can of Red Bull.,4
"Simply wonderful!!!
So easy to make a reservation.
Very nice enviroment.
Very good service!",4
"Appetizers and main menu items were served on piping hot dishes plates which we appreciated kept the food hot overall experience for this Keg at this location was very good. I have had dinner with my son at a keg in mississauga where the both our steaks were chewy, definitely not AAA. But at York Keg i have never been dissapointed. I have dined there with a TSE friend since 2000. The Artichoke dip was amazing. 
James.",3
We went for Christmas dinner and found the service to be very satisfactory. We had a reservation and our table was ready.  All the staff were very attentive and pleasant to deal with.,4
Excellent in every way!  The food was amazing!,4
"Seated almost as soon as we entered, our reservation was honored as usual. As always, the food was spectacular. Steak's prepared to perfection as were the sides & salads.  And the service was spot on.",4
"The Keg has always served nice portions, flavourful steaks!  The staff at York are pleasant, friendly and lovely!",3
"Stunning ambience.... Great service, overall an amazing time. Thank you for yet again a great experience.",4
"Excellent customer service! One order came in wrong and there was a bit of misunderstanding however staff with ease fixed the error, they were very apologetic and helpful. Food is pretty good and one of the best Sangrias I‚Äôve had!",4
"Great place for lunch, dinner, or just a drink after work.  Steaks are great, and they have many other food options as well.  This downtown location is a cut above other Keg locations.  Very good wine selection.",4
"For our annual Girls Christmas Dinner:  the food was, as always, very good; our server knowledgeable and helpful.  

The noise level was exceptionally loud making it difficult for conversation.  

Sadly, one of our party had her wallet stolen.",2
"In town overnight for an early appointment and decided on The Keg for a nice dinner. It was very busy and somehow, even with an Open Table reservation and us arriving early they forgot us in the bar well past our reservation time. When I questioned the people at the front they went through the whole check in routine and gave us a table where my seat was at the top of a small flight of stairs and in the aisle. Not good at all. Instead of making an issue we went ahead and we were glad we did. The service and food were great.",3
"It was a bit loud being seated behind the bar, we could hear the bartenders chatting and using the blender. However once the restaurant got busier the noise all faded into one.  We had made a reservation and the restaurant was empty when we arrived so it would have made more sense to seat arriving guests at a quiet location and only seat the area behind the bar once the more ideal tables were taken.
The meal was okay, the bbq chicken was quite dry.
Our server was great though, very kind and attentive.",2
"My friend and I had a very busy afternoon, taking in a concert at Roy Thomson hall and then  shopping at the Eaton Centre.  So by the time we arrived at The Keg we were both tired and hungry.  We were about half an hour early but luckily the staff were able to accommodate us and took us to our table right away.  We had a thoroughly delightful meal and were able to relax and unwind.  Terrific ending to the day.",4
"We had a great time, despite the fact that we got lost in downtown Toronto, they still had a table for us! Our waitress was very accommodating; we were not even watching the time! We were having so much fun, we just about missed closing time!! I would definitely recommend this restaurant. We had a wonderful time, the food was great, the drinks were awesome, the ambiance was comfortable and cozy and everyone was friendly and accommodating!! Great job!!!",4
"Outstanding service and attention to detail provided by our server, Steph P.  Thank you for an amazing dinner!",4
It was my SO‚Äôs birthday and we went to celebrate. I‚Äôve never been to The Keg so this was a pleasant experience. Our waiter was very kind and very patient with us. The overall vibe in the restaurant was really nice. Not too dark and not too loud. The food was delicious and cooked to my liking. We even got a free slice of cake for the birthday. Would definitely come back just for the service!!,4
We had an excellent time and the staff were amazing.   Two steaks were cooked incorrectly and the manager waved them from the bill.  We were very impressed at the custom service.  Thank you!,4
"Great location, with an awesome Patio...Great Food and Service, will keep patrons coming back to this Venue.",4
"Great Food and Service, will keep patrons coming back to this Venue.",4
"The food was good, but it was very noisy, and hard to hear.",2
Standard Keg fare in the heart of the financial district. Convenient location for a business lunch.,4
"This experience at the Keg was disappointing!!! I go about 4 times a year and get the same dinner and it has always been perfect until this time.  My steak was way underdone and chewy. The garlic potatoes had a crust on them as if they had been sitting under a heater for a while and the mushrooms didn't taste as good as they usually do. They gave me another steak which was better but I found it to still be chewy. (Terryaki steak) same as I always get. never been chewy before. In the Keg's defense it could be just a bad cut of meat. they tried hard to compensate. Gave us free cappuccino and dessert. Unfortunately even the cheesecake was not good. The Keg always used to have the best New York style cheesecake but now they make it themselves and the crust was too sweet and the texture was weird. My friend had filet mignon and cr√®me brule and  her dinner was great. I guess I need to change my choice for next time. I must say it will be quite a while before I try the Keg again. That experience really turned me off. The waiter and manager were awesome though so it was not their fault and I appreciate them trying to make the experience better. 
I will eventually try again... but I will get the filet mignon next time!  Thank you.",1
Excellent service.  Fantastic food with lots of variety.  Overall great place.,3
We had a disruptive group with foul  language and the manager Matthew went above and beyond to ensure that this did not ruin our evening. Thanks for the excellent service !!,4
Reliable menu and good service.  Unfortunately it is very noisy.,3
"I made a reservation a week ahead, but when we arrived (4 of us), we were told that we needed to wait for our table.  We arrived at 5:50 and the reservation was for 6:00.  I felt we should have been seated immediately and not given a buzzer to wait for our table since I had made a reservation.  We were not seated in the best of spots, very close to the washrooms.  I had indicated in our reservation that it was a birthday celebration so it was disappointing to have been placed in this location, particularly since I had made a reservation.  Food was good, our server was not very attentive that evening.",1
Went for a nice dinner before a concert. Staff was extremely helpful and the manager was actively ensuring all guests were having the best experience. Will definitely eat there again!,4
"I was in the lounge Fri 5 - 7p and think I left my black iPhone. Can you check and call 604 551 0114?
Thanks",3
Steak was  prepared exactly what I asked for.  Blue Not many steak places get it right. But The Keg consistently  grills the steak to your liking.,4
"Onlinereservierung hat gut geklappt.
Haben sch√∂nen Tisch am Fenster bekommen.
Toller Kellnern, der sich mit Namen vorgestellt hat. 
Steaks waren perfekt, genauso wie bestellt und in der Karte beschrieben. Medium und Medium-well. Es gab Brot mit Butter vorab und als wir nachbestellt hatten, wurde das sich z√ºgig gebracht. Toller Wein. W√ºrden es immer wieder buchen!",4
"The food is always great.
However the Keg needs to upgrade it's quality of their French fries. The are pretty ordinary compared to the competition.",4
"Even though it was quite busy, the server was very prompt and making sure everything was ok. Great service and food as always!",4
"The York Street Keg is a property that we have frequented many times, when in the Toronto area.  We were a bit disappointed in our table.  We were seated in a line of tables with people no more then 2 feet from us in either direction, making it difficult to speak to each other.  it did however make it easier for the Server tending to all the tables.  The Service was efficient and prompt.  There were numerous booths and tables not being used.",4
"We had a lovely family dinner, the best part if the experience was how the server and manager were so caring and sensitive to my son's food allergy. They prepared his food safely and I so appreciated that they were so knowledgeable. Thank you so much.",4
"Food was delicious, server was attentive and we had lunch in under an hour, which is not always what I had previously found at this location.",4
My girlfriend has some unusual allergies and the staff was very attentive in ensuring that nothing was in our meal that could have resulted in a reaction.  We keep coming back to this location because of the care they take.,4
"We arrived 5 min early for lunch and were seated immediately in a nice area by a fireplace at the back while we waited for the other couple joining us for a birthday celebration for three of us. The food selections, service, ambiance and overall value were first rate, such that our lunch lasted for almost three hours because we had such an enjoyable time together, not because the service or food was slow, in fact quite the contrary.",4
"Went for a meal on a Sunday evening and everything was top class. Great service, Great food and a great setting. I would highly recommend the steak!",4
Excellent service and very good food (as always from the Keg).,3
"Potato was cold, so I asked for another, 2nd one arrived also cold, gave up asking for a third!",1
The waitress was very good  and the food was awesome,4
"The service was very good.  The staff were all very friendly and attentive and went out of their way to make it a pleasant birthday experience.  The food is usually very good, and it was on this occasion.  I really felt we got value for our dollar.",4
"I was hosting a client for lunch. My client chose the Keg York Street as our venue and I made reservations for a Friday at noon under my name. The OpenTable calendar invitation I received was forwarded to and accepted by my guest. My colleague and I arrived before noon and were seated. The staff kindly accommodated our request for a table change. At 12:20 we learned our guest had been waiting by the host stand for some time. Upon arrival she asked for us both by name and mentioned our company name. She was told by the host 'we can't find anything' and wasn't offered an opportunity to walk through the dining room to see if we'd been seated. We eventually connected with each other via email and she made her way to our table. 
After the server took our order it took 50 minutes for our food (2 medium + 1 medium rare 6oz filets) to arrive.  I looked around the dining room for our server. When we made eye contact he stopped, nodded at me and turned around, I'm assuming to go get our food which arrived moments later. Our food was served on scorching hot, not warmed plates. A clear sign they'd been sitting under heat lamps for a while. 
The food was good. Our server checked on us once during our meal. Unfortunately, my guest had to leave abruptly because our lunch had stretched beyond two hours. When the bill was presented to me I asked the server if there was anything unusual happening that day; busier than expected? short staffed? The reply was 'oh sorry, everyone just came in at the same time'. 
Overall my experience was disappointing and mildly embarrassing.",1
"Amazing experience , been to the keg many times but not the York location until the past Thursday. Amanda was our server she was very nice and was very knowledgeable about the menu. I had the top sirloin with mashed potatoes and my boyfriend had the  Thai chicken , my only concern was with my steak I got like 2 green beans and one red pepper. Normally when I go to the keg there‚Äôs a lot more. But other then that it was so good.",4
Always consistent across all locations and great value for the dollar not to mention the convenient downtown location with indoor access to the PATH.,4
"We came for a 55th Birthday and it was such a great experience! So much fun, great service and atmosphere. We have never been disappointed at The Keg!",4
"It was just an all round great experience.  Service was courteous and prompt, with a smile. The food quality was exemplary.",4
"I was a bit disappointed with the New York steak this time. Firstly, they brought me the wrong order - a peppercorn steak - which I hadn't ordered. They took it back but in there rush to provide another steak, I got a pretty bloody steak. It was rare rather than medium",2
Fantastic meal at The Keg. Food and service was exceptional.,4
Our food was fantastic and the service was exemplary.,4
"Service was way too slow...Five people, all with steak orders and a small dessert, took 2h45min.
The steaks were delicious, as usual.",2
I was looking forward to the steak salad but it was not longer on the menu!  Other than that everything was great. Thanks,4
"Food was very good, as we've come to expect at The Keg.  However, this visit the service was disappointing.  The food took an unusually long time to come to the table.  Typically the salads would arrive shortly after we order.  They took a long time.  The server did not get our orders right.  I had ordered the Keg Classic Prime Rib but received the Prime Rib entree (i.e. no Caesar salad or mushrooms).  They were provided later once I pointed this out.  We had asked to take the leftovers home.  The server did not come back with them.      I'm sure they would've been thrown out by the time the server came back with our bill.  Overall, great food, service not so much.",3
"The Keg is consistent, and that's all I ask of it",3
"We made a reservation at the Keg York Street location for our anniversary via Opentable.ca The place was packed when we arrived so we were glad we made one! We were seated right away, and had exceptional service from our server Sophia.  The table location wasn't the greatest, as we were seated in a back corner that felt a little like a last minute set-up, but we enjoyed our meal none the less.",3
"Great food, great service. No different than any other time at The Keg",4
We were in for the Waterfront Marathon.....great pre race meal.  Our server was excellent!!,4
"Had a great meal for my wife‚Äôs 50th birthday. The, our waiter, was excellent. Food was hot, tasty and perfectly timed. Definitely going back when in Toronto.",4
Overall great experience! I do only eat fish so I had the Arctic char ! It was definitely over cooked,3
The food here was very good. We simply popped in for good steak and a decent bottle of wine and were not disappointed. Our server was knowledgeable and very pleasant. I would recommend it!,3
"Very good quality, tasty steaks at a good price. The service is always very good and cozy atmosphere.",4
"Ted was our server, he was fantastic.  We had a great time celebrating my 40th birthday.",4
The food is amazing. Our server was very polite and helpful,4
Birthday dinner.,3
Outstanding food and atmosphere!  Service was excellent!,4
"Excellent quality and service, as always!  Thanks Keg!",4
"Food excellent but service bad! After two earlier great experiences in Whistler and Ottawa we made the choice to go for quality in Toronto as well. Didicated service from the waiters is one of the strong USP‚Äôs of The Keg. Our experience in Toronto was different. No dedication, not removing dishes from the starters in time but halfway the headcourse and last but not least bad hurry at the end whilst around the bar still were enough people! Dessert was just served and she came with the bill and only ten minutes later there was the payment-terminal. A bad end and for us a reason to reconsider the Keg when we travel in Canada (as we quite often do).",2
"The Keg is constantly great steaks at a decent price !  Great choices of appetizers, awesome double baked potatoe. A little more amount of peppercorn steak would be appreciated when served - but otherwise always a good meal !",3
Excellent in all respects,4
"Prime rib was delicious, as promised, with a wonderful jus and plenty of spicy horseradish. I had a twiced-baked potato that had a nicely crisped top, but I wish I had gone with a simple baked potato. The prime rib came with a heap of crunchy deep fried onions, which were tasty but heavy, and I envied the garnish of a few cooked vegetables that the steak-eaters got. The star of each meal was the meat. 

Others had steaks, all well seasoned and cooked exactly to their liking. The prime rib comes medium (or more done if you ask, I assume) but was tender and juicy. Someone ordered their steak ""Chicago"", which means it has good char on the outside, and he liked it very much. Another ordered the blue cheese topper. I've had blue cheese on my steaks before, and even had a blue cheese walnut butter, but this is more of a blend of cheese and some breadcrumbs to make a ""cap"" for the steak. 

There are options such as a burger, chicken, salmon, etc. if someone in your party isn't inclined toward steak. There is a vegetarian cauliflower ""steak"" (I actually was tempted, as thick cuts of cauliflower hold up well to grilling). There are several meatless salads too, but they all have cheese. If you are vegetarian and would be thrilled to have a cauliflower steak, go here, but this is a steakhouse, and the menu reflects that. 

Some oddities/negatives: 
- we had tag-team servers. I've never seen that before.
- the wine list could be more adventurous, it was a little disappointing. 
- there were points where we felt the servers were upselling items, such as the blue cheese topper. It worked, though, so I can't really complain!",3
Recommend Tuna Tartar and a bottle of Meiomi.  Of course the prime rib was perfection. Would have preferred sitting away from families.,4
Good for family lunch and dinner as well as business lunch,3
"Went for my ladies Bday, food was fantastic - wine recommendation was great, and not unfairly priced (which, I‚Äôll admit was a shock). Our waitress was attentive, bright and engaging.  It wasn‚Äôt my first time to the York Street Keg, but this last visit reminded my why I‚Äôll continue to go back!",4
Great experience. Calamari entree was excellent. Main courses were also great.,4
Decent menu. Portion sizes are good. Service was attentive and timely but not intrusive. Overall very satisfied.,3
"Great food, great atmosphere, good value-well worth a visit",3
"Four steaks out of five were good; one was tough and not served hot. Baked potato cool to warm. Excellent wine list. Good table, shielded from extreme noise level but general noise still quite high.  Good service; good value for money.",3
"I've been to The Keg many times, in many cities, and at this particular location quite often.  I felt the steak quality had gone down a bit or maybe it was just the steak I had. I'm used to a certain level of meat at The Keg.  It's not Hy's or Ruth Criss but for the price at The Keg, quality has always been very good. Not this time. And no, I didn't tell the server. My friend and I were deep in convo and I had a DL for when I needed to leave so I ate it.  It wasn't inedible, just lesser than usual.",3
"With our special Clients visiting us from Ireland, we decided to have our meeting at The Keg.
Great food and service and  a manager who oversaw every detail; made the experience very
memorable and our clients were very impressed.

BRAVO !",4
"We took a few folks from our client out for a dinner to kindle our relationship.   We picked The Keg because of close-by steaks.   But, now that we have eaten there - we would pick it for it's just amazing food and well selected wine list.   Just writing what we ate is almost a review sufficient in itself - bacon-wrapped scallops with awesome sauce, Chicago style bacon-wrapped medium rare blue cheese-crusted filet mignon served with 2 bottles of Stag's Leap Cabernet followed by a Billy Miner coffee (Irish cream & Kahlua).
As you say that - you can almost taste it.
The service was equally delicious.   Extremely attentive.  Refined cooperation for table service among the staff.
Please do your tongue a favor and get yourself to The Keg.",4
My food was not cooked to my liking they took us back and came back again not right. Ordered a tea after dinner and there was lipstick on the cup. My waitress was great and took both off my bill but it was very disappointing.,2
"This place was amazing , my servers name was janilee and our hostess/escort was Julia.
The manger was really sweet as well for agreeing to my flower arrangement at the table and they all played a vital role in making my boyfriends birthday a  special day for him. The ambiance was exquisite , the food was amazing the service was outstanding!  I was so happy! More importantly he was happy :) Thank you guys and please give these ladies the Regards they deserve. It was our first and will not be our last time !",4
"We went for our Anniversary celebration and the service was just okay/moderate.   But I understand that people have good and bad days and the service received was good enough.  We've been to other Keg locations where the server tried to get to know us and if we were celebrating a birthday or a celebration, they would try to make it special.  Another disappointment was that we received mushy and fishy lobsters which kind of ruined the mood.  While they apologized and took the lobster part off the bill ($17), they didn't do anything to go above and beyond to make us satisfied.  Service and food was fair but the ambiance was nice.",1
"We were out for a special date night. Steak was what we wanted and the Keg delivered in spades. The steaks were cooked to perfection, the wine complimented the meat, the escargot were hot and garlicky. We were very happy with the whole evening.",3
"Always have had great experiences at the Keg. Unfortunately there was a hair in my girlfriends meal. The manager came and apologized, brought her a new meal and compensated it. Which I really appreciated. Other than that the food and desserts were great. I would definitely return to this location.",3
The service was really professional and resulted in a smooth well served experience. Food excellent and prepared exactly as requested. Very pleasant atmosphere,4
I love the Keg and go often. I found the meal to be a bit disappointing this last time. The twice baked potato was very dry (over cooked) as were the veggies. Steak was good as usual.,3
"What a great way to wind up a busy week at Le Keg, with clients and good friends.
Combned with good food and great service, got us prepped for a weekend of Blues
at The Southside Shuffle.

The Keg naver fails to deliver..........BRAVO !",4
A lot of Kcal but delicious ! The atmosphere is special (good !) and the steaks were delicious. The brownie is very huge but delicious as well. A great experience and perfect for a business meal. Moreover the place is huge but quiet enough to discuss,4
We like The Keg because of the consistent food and service. This was a very nice location with a very professional manager and staff. Steaks were cooked perfectly.,3
"I'd been to the Keg several times for wine and appetizers, but took a group there for dinner and it was excellent.",4
"He music was way to loud. We had to shout to hear each other across the table. Veggies were served steamed and dry, very bland with no taste or flavour. For the price point you can find so many better places in the city",2
"I had never been before, and I was blown away! I loved everything about the food, the ambiance, and the service! The steak and Alaskan crab is to die for!!!",4
"Went here for a get together with friends, had a reservation, was too hot inside, asked to be seated outside. Drinks were good, the food wasn't anything special. I had been looking forward to this meal, and I wasn't at all impressed. Only thing that was good was the drink specials. The service was sub par, had to flag the waitress down to get our bills, and to get more drinks. Will not be going back to this Keg location.",2
"It was a good atmosphere for a date, price abit to high but overall good experience.",2
"We went for our anniversary and the experience was very special.  We got a full lobster and the prime rib and both were excellent.  Our server, Jana, was lovely and very accommodating.  We had a great time.",4
"We were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary with a trip to the city to watch a play and have a nice dinner. 
This was a perfect day.",4
"Every time we go to this location, there is an issue as to where we would like to sit.  The ladies that greet you are not friendly and clearly have issues if you do not like where they place you. The only way you can change your seat is speaking to a manager.
Any late arrivers in your party are greeted by the hostess with a  scowl on her face!  Very disappointing service and the start of ones dining experience.  We always meet here to celebrate our friendship. Time to find another Keg location!",1
"Met up with friends I hadn‚Äôt seen in a long time. Our sever was not very attentive. I‚Äôm a regular customer and always appreciate your good service. My lobster was cold so that was as disappointing as well. 
I am returning Wednesday so I hope my experience is as I have had in the last.",2
Great night.  Service was awesome.,4
Great food and great service.  Was a little loud as large table beside us.,4
"It was my husband birthday and the food took 2 hours to arrive. It was a terrible day! Ruined the occasion
The ma√Ætre kept saying he was working personally on our order and that it would not take more than 15 and then 15 more...
In the end they did not charge for the food but the experience was terrible",0
"Went to celebrate my birthday, which I indicated in my reservation.  I thought they might at least acknowledge it since it was asked when I made my reservation but it never came up. Besides that the food and service were what I've come to expect when visiting the keg, very delicious.",3
"I had two minor issues and they are both personal. It was too cold (I'll bring something extra to wear next time,) and ice water didn't help. Otherwise, I enjoy my experience.",3
"We attended The Keg to celebrate my mother‚Äôs birthday prior to attending the theatre. The food was fantastic!  It was cooked to order and of first quality. The waitress was very friendly and attentive, and served us very well. We would definitely return to The Keg again.",4
"Good food, plenty of space and wide tables do you‚Äôre not juggling food. Food has been better here though.",3
"When I want a good steak - I go to the Keg because they almost ALWAYS get it right.  Unfortunately, this was the first time ever it wasn't (asked for medium well but it came well done) for both mine and my daughter's steaks.   But they fixed it right away with no questions asked and apologies for messing it up!  So excellent service recovery.",4
The perfect place to enjoy a very good wine with a delicious meal after the theatre; great place for conversation and discuss the play.,4
Cooles Restaurant. Essen top!!!üòçüòçüòçüòãüòãüòã. Bedienung top. Sofort wieder,4
3 of us had the classic prime rib(what the Keg is known for) the beef was chewy as an old leather boot very disappointing.,2
Fabulous new salads on the menu!,3
"Food was of a good standard, service was appalling - it seemed they were poorly trained and poorly managed - we had our waiter changed (due to first one finishing shift - funny he was still there when we left!) our main was shoved in front of us while my partners starter plate was in front of her and while I was only half way through mine - when I mentioned we were clearly not ready for our mains I was told ‚Äòthat is fine we will just keep it warm for you‚Äô - I requested the steaks to be recooked not to merely be kept warm on the pass - which seemed to upset the wait staff. Wait staff talking 
amoung themselves including about the tips they had received from leaving customers.

The setting is good, the food is good, but the price asks for so much more including service. I can only think the rent is high so the prices are high while all else goes by the wayside.",2
Fabulous drinks and good!!!  It was a very relaxing way to spend some quality time with friends!  Will definitely return!,4
"Food was great and server was lovely -  only complaint is the length of time it took to get our food . We were seated at 5:45 and didn‚Äôt get our mains until 7, with kids that was a long wait!",2
"Good Food, Ambiance, Quick & Friendly Service. Mini dessert options are the best. Must try :)",3
"The Keg is our ""go-to"" place for lunches, it is quiet, tables are comfortable, food is good (although pricy), service is usually very good too.  Staff are always friendly.  If they mess up, they always fix the problem.  Would like soup/sandwhich combos to come back.  I had a salad, no coffee, drink or dessert and I still spent well over $20.  But overall, quality of food is very good and so is service and ambiance so I will still be coming back!",3
Service was a little slow.  Most of us had salads and still took quite some time before we got the meal.,2
"Best cobb salad in Toronto with chunky ripe avocados and cubes of white chicken breast!  So good!  My parents had the halibut fish and chips and creme brulee for dessert ... again, so good!  When we were seated, the hostess told us where the washrooms were, which was great, so that we didn't have to flag anyone down, when we had to use the restrooms at the end of our meal.  Our server, Amanda, was sooooo sweet, she checked on us several times during our lunch and always refilled our water glasses promptly, without us having to request for more water!  Good food and good staff!",4
"This location is wonderful - excellent service, excellent food.",4
Great food good service. If I am ever in the area again I would definitely go  back,4
"Our server was quite knowledgeable of menu preparation and presentation.  Also, was very approachable and friendly. Steaks were on point. Wonderful ambience and a bartender who can make a righteous dry martini! Very enjoyable experience.",4
We had an excellent meal at the Keg the steaks were cooked to perfection. I loved the teriyaki steak. The service was excellent and the atmosphere great. Would definitely recommend the Keg for anyone coming to Toronto.,4
The service was slow but the server was nice and the food was good.  Don't go for lunch expecting to be out in an hour.  My group of 6 was there for two and a half  hours!!  Very frustrating.,2
Everyone enjoyed the food and had a great time!,4
Excellente,4
"This Keg has very modern decor. We were a group of four. Two of us arrived earlier and sat at the bar, the wait staff was very friendly and the service first class. we were shown to our seats with our wine following us. The food wait staff again very friendly and professional. The food from steaks to tuna tacos was cooked as asked and eaten to the last bite.
Great experience.",3
"Wanted to dine on the big terrace out back but it seemed like rain.  We were given a table right by the terrace, execellent service from Brendan.   Food was great as always.  Will be returning to the back patio in August!",4
"The food for my guests was delicious.service perfect friendly prompt.

My cauliflower steak bland and overpriced...but my other food was delicious.

My other guests loved it all..wine etc...the nice touch of free mocha cake etc...so small glitsch with my choice of main.",4
Sam A was amazing! She went above an beyond to make our experience phnomenal!,4
"The KEG never disappoints, with great food and superb service.
Our Clients were here from Europe and they thoroughly enjoyed our time together on the fabulous patio.
The NEW Social Hour is a very nice touch and is a great way to start and then transition into Dinner.

BRAVO !",4
"Wonderful time with out of town friends. Very enjoyable steak dinner for 3 of us. The fourth had fish. we all loved what we had. so tasty, very friendly and welcoming staff. service was outstanding.
Highly recommended.",4
Our server was very attentive. Meal was very good. Wine selection we had was great. Seating was great as we asked for a booth even though we were only two.cost was good. And we got free dessert as was our 37 anniversary.,4
Birthday lunch,4
My only issue is that the booths are tight for large groups.  We were a group of 5 and the semi circle booth we sat in was tight.,2
"This is the second time that I have come to this location. They absolutely did not disappoint. I had a fantastic evening with my family for my birthday. The service was wonderful and prompt; the food was spectacular and cooked perfectly; the ambiance was on point and overall I felt really special. I was brought their famous cake slice for my birthday (complimentary) with a candle that I blew out. Thank you The Keg on York for exceeding my expectations once again. I highly recommend your food, service, and your location. The person taking care of us was named Andrew. He was WONDERFUL! Thank you Andrew; you made my birthday special. 
Side note: We each ordered the bleu cheese filet, with the twice baked potatoe. YUMMMM!!!!!!!!!",4
"Everything was perfect, EXCEPT there was a hair in the whipped butter! Since everything else was fantastic, we decided to just keep it to ourselves! 
Steaks were cooked perfectly, and the waitress was great!",3
Service was too rushed for a Saturday night relaxing dinner- in and out in an hour,3
Great service!,4
The waiter and management went out of their way to address the fact that my meal wasn‚Äôt up to standard. I was very pleased with the professionalism of the staff.,3
We had a terrific meal and great family get together.,4
"The narrow hallway between the 2 larger areas is not the best area to sit , however the bar and outside areas are nice.  Keg Esplanade is better,",2
"Overall, I had a great time! The food was great and so was the service. I put 4 stars for value only because the portions are smaller then Id like. But Id still go back for any special occasion.",4
"I am from Buffalo, NY and visited Toronto to see a wonderful husband and wife piano duo give a concert at the Toronto Jazz Bistro. Having eaten at the Keg in Niagara Falls a couple of times I knew the dinner would be great and I chose this location because it was close the the Jazz Bistro.

Our server Tim was very friendly and helpful. My date and I both had Prime Rib and Lobster which was wonderful and cooked to perfection. It was nice to see that the quality of the food does not change from location to location.

I will highly recommend the Keg Restaurants to anyone I know visiting Canada. Wish you would open a restaurant in my area.",4
Great experience.  Great food Jill our server was spectacular.,4
"We thoroughly enjoyed a fantastic dining experience on T.O's best Patio restaurant.
Awesome Steak and Seafood combos paired with some good wine, made it all worthwhile.

Many thanks to the Staff and Management.",4
It was Pretty neat! Would mosey over for another piece of animal in the future.,4
A very enjoyable meal and the service was very good,4
Had a great meal & good service. My grandson enjoyed his birthday pie,4
"Quiet and nice place (for ronantic dates as well as business lunch). Beautiful atmosphere, friendly service. Food was average, dessert was served as small bites - great idea and very good value (compared to food).",3
"Very nice evening, friendly staff and good food",3
"Have eaten at the Keg many times before going to the opera. Very disappointed this evening at portion size. Perhaps to keep costs down, the restaurant decided to chintz out on quantities. I‚Äôve order a half rack of ribs many times. This time the portion was much smaller than usual. I don‚Äôt think there were more than 3 forkfuls of coleslaw. I should have complained at the time. If I do go back again, I will remind the server of my past bad experience.",2
Experience was good. Server was nice. Marked that we were having a birthday celebration but no cake came.,3
Once again a fabulous meal.  Never cook prime rib at home so it is my go to dinner at the Keg.  Never a let down.,4
Delicious food. Friendly staff. Good prime rib. Fresh vegetables. Nice ambience. Good value for money. Good service.,4
Excellent service and great food. Very nice staffs and had a great anniversary! Definitely will come back here!,4
We arrived and had a reservation for two. They decided we should sit at a small table for two in a corner. Unacceptable.  I took the hostess five minutes to review the seating plan for a 4:30pm reservation.  A failing grade at the front.,3
"Always accommodating, professional and quality food& service. We were a part of 8 and were treated very well!!",3
The server was possibly having a bad night? The service was extremely basic no conversation just order taking and not even a ‚Äúyou‚Äôre welcome to our thank you a. My rare steak was more medium than rare. Had to send back the calamari for being cold. I have been to this location over the years and enjoyed it but has definitely gone downhill.,2
"The Keg is always a great place to get a quality steak dinner. Whenever i'm in Canada, I try to get to The Keg for at least one dinner. It is also a great place for business meetings.",4
Great restaurant with lots of menu options and amazing food!,4
Best. Steak. Ever.,4
Service was great and the food tasted great and came quickly.,4
Just excellent,4
"The customers behind us talked too loud, which was a bit annoying. Lobster tail was too salty. Bread and steak were pretty good.",2
"Special occasion (birthday) was never acknowledged.   The salalds that were part of the classic dinnners were served before the appetizer ... appetizer came half way through the salad course.  We're not offered a top up on the coffee.   Felt like we were on a clock to be out of the restaurant.   
Quality of the food is / was the redeeming element of the experience.",3
"Came here for a date with my girlfriend. We really enjoyed everything. We got the calamari for appetizer and it was really good. We both had Caesar salads and those were disappointing. Flavorless and not enough dressing. Steak was cooked perfectly. overall, I would recommend.",3
Date night with my wife as we had supper at the Keg and then went to the Leaf's game after.  Excellent service and the food and wine was wonderful as always,4
Excellent!,4
it was a wonderful time. the Keg recognized the important of our occasion and celebrated it.,3
The filet was amazing. Going  back for lunch later in the week.,4
We chose The Keg before heading to AC2 at the Sony Centre. Not too far of a walk (15 mins).,4
"Everyone enjoyed their meals and our server was very attentive.  My party and I were visiting Toronto from Sudbury and decided to choose The Keg on York Street because my daughter works across the street from The Keg.  I definitely will come back another time and bring along other friends or family.  We have many friends who come to Toronto to see shows, games, concerts, etcetera and I will be glad to recommend your restaurant. Thank you for making us all feel so welcome.  I definitely feel that the meals on the menu were well worth the cost and we walked away feeling satisfied.",3
"I usually love eating at Keg restaurants because they are reliably good in terms of food, service and value. This particular location was disappointing.  The food was only so-so and the service was really not very good.  Overall a disappointing birthday experience with my family.",2
service was fast and attentive.  Not in your face attentive but aware with good timing  Since it was a business lunch that was important to me  Food was excellent and cooked as asked for,4
We had an amazing dinner as always. Outstanding service and ambience.,4
"Never disappointed with The Keg, except the portions seem to be getting smaller and the prices keep going up. The waiters are fast, the food is great and the atmosphere is energetic. This is my favourite location.",4
"Service  at the bar was very good. Once seated service deteriorated. We asked for bread 3-4 times which arrived after our appetizers were eaten. 
We wanted bread because both salads we ordered were slathered with too much dressing. They were sickening.",2
"We went for my daughter‚Äôs birthday and had both excellent service and food-Steph, our server, was amazing!! She took care of our every need and made my daughter feel special! Thanks!!",4
Always a favourite when in this part of Toronto. The place is always packed and the food is of excellent quality.,4
Certainly great food and very efficient and pleasant service.,4
We went for dinner before a Raptors game on a Friday.  Make a rez as it gets busy.  The wine list is extensive with lots to choose from for a reasonable price.  The food is always excellent with the service to match.,4
The keg had some great food and excellent servers and hostesses! We were on our honeymoon and our server was nice enough to give us a dessert to celebrate. We are from the states and the hospitality blew us away! Definitely more high end than we were accustomed to but it was delicious and we didn‚Äôt feel out of place!,4
"We all ordered teriyaki steak. It was juicy, perfectly done and with the side choices worth the value. We will be back. Thank you.",4
Love to stop by for weekend family dinner. Meat is always cooked great. Good choice of veggie and salads on side.,4
Staff was friendly and efficient. Food was delicious. Steaks were cooked to perfection,4
"You can never go wrong with the Keg  and the York street location is no different. The decor upon entering is sleek yet inviting. The staff is very professional and kind. The food is almost always on point, except for my cut of steak i had this time around. However the manager was extremely kind and did not charge me for my dinner as i was barely able to eat my steak. My husbands steak was cooked perfectly. A must order is the french onion soup!",4
Came for dinner before the theatre.  Perfect location. Staff were attentive.,3
Delicious food and service was fabulous!  Nice and close to Sheraton Hotel!,4
"Love The Keg!! Great food, value and service.",4
"Good Service, nice ambience. Met a friend for a ""catch up"" chat and did not feel rushed  which was great. The food was excellent - just as ordered and well done steaks seem to be a problem for most restaurants but not the Keg. Will definitely visit again!",3
We both thoroughly enjoyed our steaks. My husband had seafood with his. The wine choices were great-always a priority for me that a restaurant serves Sauvignon Blanc. We were having a belated celebration for my husband's birthday and they brought him ice-cream cake. Delicious even though we didn't have room for it. Susanna was an outstanding server-very hospitable and capable.,4
Delicious food. Staff were attentive to allergy issue. A wonderful experience; will definitely return.,4
"Wonderful! As every time we visited, The Keg was great.",4
"Came in a little early for our reservation. Was no problem getting a earlier sitting.  

We were greeted twice by two different servers.  I guess they were working in teams that night because it was fairly busy.  

Our drink order was taken very promptly, followed by our dinner order taken very timely.  

Apps were at our table in no time at all.  Delicious as always. 

Dinner entrees followed shortly.  Once again, dinner was perfect.  Everything was hot and tasty.  

Always a great experience when we go to the Keg, no matter what location it maybe.",4
"This was my first visit to this Keg location and I was not disappointed. My best friend and I were celebrating my birthday and everything was wonderful. We were served by Justin who was very attentive and friendly. In fact, all of the staff were great! We explained that we were seeing a show nearby at 8:00 and our appetizers, salads, mains and complimentary dessert were served with impeccable timing. Never did we feel rushed or as though we were waiting too long. Not to mention that our steaks were cooked to perfection and my sangria was delicious. 
The decadent food, excellent service and casual but chic atmosphere is something I look forward to experiencing again during my next visit to Toronto.",4
Food was delicious and service excellent. One objection: music was too heavy in the bass level. I felt pounding in my head a good deal of my time there.,4
Always a great experience with excellent service and the food is always delicious!,4
"Our waitress was excellent and very atttentive , he made a big difference",4
We were at The Keg for a retirement. The food was great. The service was exceptional.,4
"The Keg has been around for a long time and continues its reliable and comfortable operation. The food is always good. The service is too. Regrettably, the noise level is more annoying than it should be for such a nice place. Otherwise, eating at the Keg is worth it for value, quality, service and ambiance.",3
"I usually enjoy my Keg experiences but this time everything from the service to the food was terrible.

Waitress was not congenial or cared much and left empty plates sitting for too long bringing the desert menu literally 30 minutes after we finished our meal when it was time to go.
Not pleasant or caring whatsoever.

I took my 7 year old for dinner before the Hockey game and we actually ordered from the adult menu (2) 10oz prime ribs and they were both completely under cooked full of fat. asparagus was steamed and soggy.",1
"we had a great working lunch, good food, good service.  Nothing to complain about.",3
"This is our favourite restaurant to go for ""date night"". Food is always delicious. Ambience is great. Serving staff are very attentive. This time, however, we did feel like we were being a bit rushed out the door following our meal. We were finishing our wine, and staff put a Reserved sign on the table while we were still sitting there. We then felt like we had to hurry to drink & leave.. We enjoy each other's company & time shared is special even while our food is digested. It was a very busy evening in the restaurant & we do understand that tables are highly sought, however so are repeat customers.",3
Meal was great. The service was outstanding I would highly recommend this restaurant,4
The Keg is always a great spot for dinner ater work in the downtown core!,3
"Good is always very good and consistent at The Keg.  Ambience, service and price is excellent.",4
Excellent place for dinner before catching a sporting event.,4
"For the Keg, I was not impressed. I ordered medium rare and my steak came very under cooked. When I sent it back and it came back out, the bacon was no longer there and the chives and butter from my potatos were gone. I was offered nothing for this inconvenience. The price we paid for the meal was not worth it. The heat in the restaurant was unbearable. We left sweating terribly. Overall it wasnt a good dining experience.",1
Okay seating is not comfortable at all,4
Tasty Filet Mignon and nice piece of birthday ice cream cake.  Service was excellent.,4
"The Keg is great on so many levels.
Great Food and Service,
With Steak and Sea Food that we ordered, that was done to perfection.

We opted for Bar Seating (As opposed to a Booth) and the interaction with the other Patrons
was awesome and the Bar Staff was very attentive to all our needs.

Great night out........BRAVO !",4
"This is an exceptional Keg Restaurant...in addition to offering the traditional menu, and having fantastic service the ambiance at this particular Keg is Awesome!!! There's a phenomenal bar and huge fireplace, and an amazing outdoor patio. It's one of the best Kegs, except for possibly the Keg Mansion on Jarvis St.",4
"I ordered a Caesar for the night, I have to say that I had better Caesar elsewhere. However, the food was good and the service was amazing. 

My waitress came back to check on us every now and then but it wasn't until a point where I feel annoyed which is perfect!",3
Very good servers. They made the dinner extra enjoyable.,4
"Dinner was hot and tasty.  
The restaurant  was cool  (everyone in our party of 5 were not comfortable).  My son and I had to wear our coats while eating unfortunately.  
Restaurant did not seem to be as busy as usual and service was slower.",3
"Five of us from Kincardine On picked this Keg for a meal prior to our theatre engagement.
We always pick a Keg on our trips because they are consistantly great.
Our dining experience was great.....again!
Thanks",3
"Table was ready upon arrival and wait staff very attentive.  Considering it was the week before Christmas and extremely busy, enjoyed dinner",3
Awesome!!!!,4
as an after theatre place it works out perfectly for us.  Congenial staff and great service.,4
"The food was great, but if you could add rice to the menu that would be awesome. I know you have a form of Asiago rice, but it is not the same as regular white or brown rice. Other than that, the waiter was very accommodating to my request.",3
We had a great time at the Keg (as usual). We were in the raised section in the middle which gave us a bit of quiet from the busy bar scene. Our server was attentive and did a great job. Steak was cooked to perfection as well. It was a great occasion with six friends to catch up over dinner.,4
Our waiter was talking too much and not paying attention to what  we order and blamed us for ordering it wrong and we changed our minds...  never will come to this location ever again,1
"Very crowded for a Tuesday night in the freezing cold.  Good thing we had reservations!  We had the wedge salad, filet, and cauliflower ""steaK""  which were all outstanding, as was the warm bread.  We enjoyed the cocktails and wine, too.  Loved the fireplaces and decor, too.",4
The Keg never fails to deliver and york st keg is one of the kegs real gems!,4
"One of our favourite dinner spots.  Service is always great, steaks and prime rib are always cooked perfectly, plus the atmosphere  is cozy and seating comfortable.",4
Daughter‚Äôs friend birthday,3
"Six os us meet for dinner every 3 or 4 months and we always chose the Keg.
Easier to book online then phone in for a reservation. Love the french onion soup",3
"Great food, great service, great atmosphere - great time!  Can't wait to go back - will be our first choice when down in the city again.",4
"Food was great, servers friendly. Our only discomfort was that some of our party became uncomfortable due to the heat from the fireplace and had to remove their jackets and move their chairs to the sides of the table.",3
Absolutely fantastic. Love everything about this place. Best steak ever. Friendlier staff ever.,4
Had a great time. We were seated quickly with a reservation and served likewise. I always enjoy the steaks from the Keg and the waiter gave just enough suggestions to educate but not enough to control my decision.,4
"I‚Äôve visited several Keg‚Äôs and they‚Äôre all amazing. From friendly greeting service to the food to the check out experience, all is great. Very high end experience with moderate pricing.",4
"I decided to try the fried chicken with buttermilk ranch and coleslaw.  It was boring, dry and tasteless.  Coleslaw was even worse.  Buttermilk ranch dressing did not help matters.  A tasteless hard-crusted bread is also served.  What ever happened to delicious the sourdough bread the Keg used to serve years ago?  In fact, the sourdough bread alone was a reason to eat at the Keg.  The menu was so boring it was hard to chose what to eat.  Salad selection poor.",1
Experience at the Keg on York Street was great.  They were so accommodating from the beginning to end. They readily accepted a headcount change for our reservation.  Offered to check our coats upon arrival.  Our server allowed us to order sides that were not on the lunch menu (hint:  try asking for the twice baked potato!)  She also provided separate bills and divided the bill of the birthday celebrant into all of our bills.  Totally convenient!   Would definitely recommend The Keg on York for any special occasion!,3
"It was wonderful as usual! The host and server took care of us and our 'situation' lol so it was great! The only thing I found strange ( which maybe the Keg as changed it's policy) but I mentioned 3 times that it was in fact my mom's bday which is why we were there and yet we still got charged for the Billy Miner Pie.  No big deal, but a little disappointed.",4
"Excellent service, especially when you have a nut allergy.",4
Went for a colleague's birthday lunch.  You can always count on the Keg for a good meal!  Waiter was attentive without being annoying.,4
Just terrible. Horrible service. Kids running around like a playground not elegant at all,0
"Both the hostess and server were cheerful and courteous.  The food was as expected, delicious!",4
Food was delicious and atmosphere quiet and soothing.,3
"The restaurant was very noisey.  We were 5 seated at a table for 6, half booth and 3 chairs.  The table was so small that we had to keep asking the server to take dishes away to make room for our meal.  The 3 chairs were in the aisle and we kept getting bumped by servers and other customers going by.  Other Keg restaurants are much much nicer than this one.",1
The food was amazing!!! Very cozy keg it was my first time at this location and the staff are very efficient... I gave it 10/10,4
"My wife and I are semi regular Keg dinners and found the food was served just the way we expected.  

Staff were great.  They seated us as per reservation time and request, even at a busy time. 

Great place for a great tasting steak.",4
Food and service were excellent as usual. Great atmosphere along with a great location make the Keg a must when we visit Toronto.,4
The location is great and has a good vibe. Our steak was better than the salmon. Kids ( 14 year olds) loved it.,3
"Went for dinner after seeing the ""Bat Out of Hell"" musical.  Were seated immediately. Service was quick (almost too quick). Felt a bit rushed. Bread was amazing. Had the New York Striploin, wife had the filet mignon. Both were delicious.  Starter salads (caesar and mixed greens) were just okay. Guinness on tap - nice and cold.  Would definitely come back again.",3
steak was done perfectly; waiters and staff were awesome. Excellent meal!,4
"Have dined at several Keg restaurants, but the food here was better than usual.  The service however was outstanding and really made the evening. Everyone was very attentive.",4
Our group had the prime rib and steaks. Everyone's meat was cooked as ordered and was delicious.  The server was attentive without interrupting conversation. The only disappointment was the removal of fire-roasted mushrooms from the sides option.,4
"My 25 year old daughter and I spent the weekend in Toronto to attend a hockey game. We had previously enjoyed The Keg in Montreal. It's a new tradition for us to eat at The Keg when we visit Canada from the USA. We had a great meal and a great server, Emily, at this York St location. We will absolutely return!",3
"Our previous experience there in Feb. was bad - long wait for our food, surly waiter. This last was super: the waiter responded well to our telling him we had to leave by 7:00 (We arrived at 5:30) and ensured that our food was ready quickly, so we could relax over dessert and coffee as well.",4
Thank you for making my day super extra special. Me and Billy Miner are soulmates!,4
Excellent meal and service. Venue a bit noisy but otherwise a great dinner.,3
"We were really pleased with the service and the food was great! We had the prime rib. The waiter noticed that the meat wasn't cooked as much as I had requested (medium and it came out rare) so he took it upon himself to return it and have it cooked more. For the inconvenience, my glass of wine was free.",4
Very friendly server. Very reasonably priced. Good sized portions.,4
"What I like about the Keg is the consistency of the meal. Always prepared very well and never had an issue. Service was friendly and we were well taken care of.
Not sure if I would qualify the noise level as energetic. Noisy is a better word. The proximity of the seating in certain areas isn't necessarily ideal for conversations when you have to really raise your voice to hear someone.",4
Good food and great service. The restaurant d√©cor is allo pleasant.,3
We had a lovely meal and our waiter was excellent as well.  Everything was cooked perfectly and we were celebrating 2 birthdays and they gave us 2 desserts for free.,4
"Our server, I believe her name was Ann-Marie, was outstanding!",4
"The food was AMAZING and the scene was comfortable for all 4 of us who went to celebrate a friends birthday, and although we left a 25% tip to a server who was a super B**** its the first time I've ever gotten such poor service from a waitress although she was super thankful when we tipped. Will definitely try a different keg next time.",2
We were served by Kurt from behind the main bar and we had excellent service,4
My wife and I had a special anniversary and we were blown away by the fantastic service. The food and wine were great and the quiet table against the window was so nice. I cannot express how impressed we were. FIRST CLASS! Thank You.,4
Great service with a quick waitress. We were on the way to a concert and she made sure we had our food and drinks all in time. Great atmosphere and super food done perfectly! We will definitely come back again!,4
Came here with a friend for his birthday. The staff were nice and they made sure we enjoyed our night. They came over quietly to say happy birthday with  a birthday cake. Instead of letting everyone around us know it was a birthday party.,4
As usual I had excellent food and excellent service. We were there for a pre theatre dinner. Highly recommend.,4
"Food is always great at the keg. Our server, believe her name was Stephanie, was very nice, not pushy, very knowledgeable about all of the menus. Great experience!!",4
"The Keg does steak right. If you've looking for an alternative to steak, I'd recommend the lobster salad. Working in the area means coming here for lunch quite often, there usually isn't a wait to get a table (especially not if you've reserved on Open Table).",3
Incredible steak house. Excellent service. Fab ambience. A real gem.,4
Delicious! And we were given a complimentary dessert since it was our anniversary. Would go back.,4
Quality food and amazing service ! It was hard to have a conversation but the atmosphere was fun and our waitress was so nice.,4
Enjoyed my steak and lobster.  Service was good also.,4
Keg steak was amazing and so worth it have on special occasion dinner. Everything was great how I expected.,3
very good for have friends gathering. reasonabel price and tasty meal but little salty.i'll come again.,4
We love all of the Keg Steakhouses so far. This one was great and within walking distance to our hotel and the Rogers Centre.,4
"The Keg never disappoints.
Great Food and Service; commencing with awesome Appetizers, followed by Steaks and Seafood that were cooked to perfection and the wrap-up with exquisite Desserts.

The Wine List (Whilst limited) is moderately priced and Pairs well with the Entrees

We will continue to support this Venue (In particular) and The Chain, as a whole.

BRAVO !",4
"Can't fault the service, it was excellent. We ordered the filet mignon steak and it was cooked to perfection. The garlic mash was lovely but wasn't hot, so we said to our server and they brought an extra side dish of mash. Beautiful! Great experience overall and good value.",3
The food was great and our waiter was amazing. There was missing a little bit of ambiance... I felt our table was away from all the action.,3
"My husband and I went to The Keg on our visit to Toronto, Canada for our Anniversary! The Food was great and I enjoyed the drink choices. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",4
"Excellent food, fantastic steak, amazing desert, truly delicious.  Very impressed with the service and the ambience, highly recommend!",4
"I have been to the keg many times but never to this particular location. I actually found that the food was exponentially better than at the Keg Manor (though the food there is amazing too). The ambience and dim lighting is nicer for a date night or intimate occasion whereas at the Manor I feel it's a better fit for groups. Everything we had to eat was absolutely delicious. I had never had the lettuce wedge salad and though the concept is so basic it was to die for... particularly the blue cheese dressing. The watermelon mojito and white sangria were delicious. The filet mignon was perfect as always, cooked rare as I requested and wrapped in crispy bacon with bearnaise sauce. The twice baked potato is such a good alternative to mashed potatoes. The mushrooms neptune were delicious and my only complaint is that there weren't enough of them, the calamari is some of the best in the city (and in other cities as well quite frankly) and the baked garlic shrimp were so delicious too. We didn't have any dessert during this visit but it has never disappointed either! All around good time, I can't wait to go again!",3
"My husband and I just celebrated our first wedding anniversary and it was also our first time at The Keg and we were not disappointed. The patio was such a nice, quiet place to sit. The service was amazing and the food was also really good. I have a gluten allergy and the manager came out to address it, which I always love because it means that they are taking it seriously.

Thanks for a great night!",4
Great food....outstanding steaks....lovely wine.....our server James looked after us very well....with good recommendations and service,3
"Service was super attentive, food was savoury, overall top-class experience",4
I have always liked the Keg. Only thing I feel could be better at the Keg in general including this location is to have more Vegetarian options. The current options and cauliflower dishes dont cut it. actually is sucks. I would have gone to keg atleast once a month if they had more veggie options as my wife's a vegetarian,3
Good for quiet dinner with your significant other or family.,3
"Had a great time, and our server Tatiana helped make it that much better.",4
Great food with excellent service. Fantastic location and very nice atmosphere to enjoy conversation together for our anniversary.,4
"I found this on TripAdvisor and made a reservation on OpenTable for our Sunday night meal in Toronto.  There are several locations, and I had to change my reservation since I made it for one that wasn‚Äôt the closest to my hotel.  We walked the ¬Ω mile or so from our hotel, the Doubletree, and were promptly seated.  Our waiter was Justin G.  He seemed to be learning but did a mostly great job.  We decided to splurge.  I had escargots, which were actually Champignons Escargot (Snails stuffed in mushrooms).  Very tasty! My other half had the French onion soup.  He had a bottle of the JT Chardonnay, and I had two large draughts of local, seasonal beer.  We both had the 10 oz filets:  mine blue to rare, and his medium rare.  We both chose asparagus for our side.  We split a side order of mushrooms as well.  Everything was delicious.  My steak was cooked perfectly and was ‚Äúwarm and bloody‚Äù as I prefer.  I did get lost when I was trying to return from the bathroom since I had gone a circuitous way and didn‚Äôt realize I wasn‚Äôt too far from my table, but Justin saw me looking lost and pointed back the short way to my table.  All of the service people seemed to be waiting on their tables but could have been a little more attentive to other tables for tasks such as water refills when they were walking by with a pitcher, etc.  Staff from the kitchen usually brought out the food so sometimes it could take a while for personal service.  That was my only complaint-more attentive service to empty glasses and a visit by the assigned waiter after each course is presented by kitchen staff.  When we return to Toronto, this place, or one of its namesakes depending where we are staying, will definitely be high on the list for a great steak!  It‚Äôs gets a gold medal from me!",4
Excellent visit to the Keg as usual. Prime rib was amazing. Great service as well,3
Excellent in every respect. This is likely the best Keg franchise in Ontario. We have never had a bad meal. The food is always hot and cooked to order. The service courteous and prompt without being annoying. Well done.,4
Food and service great.  A little more space between guests would be appreciayed and the wine list is a bit overpriced.  The visit from management was a pleasant surprise. We had a great time and will return to a Keg to celebrate other specisl occasions.,3
Actually one of the best meals I have had in a long time. Steaks were superb as was the craft beer and ambience of the restaurant,4
Never disappoints. Few drinks at the bar before we sat down to dinner. Everything was very good. Great location walking distance from the Renaissance.,3
"This is the first time I used this option to reserve and will do it again.
We meet and go to the Keg about 4 times a year and every time a call to reserve at least three days before we're to meet and try to reserve for a party of usually 6 at around 5:30 I'm ALWAYS told there are no tables. 
So thank you .",2
Nice convenient spot for excellent steak at a reasonable price.,3
This was the best meal I've ever had the service was amazing and the food was unbelievable it literally took my breath,4
The steaks were a bit disappointing. Excellent service.,2
This is an amazing that bring justice to the good name of the brand. Food and service was impeccable. We are looking forward to come back.,4
"The food was great as usual, but this time at The Keg the service was not so great as I expected. We were having family dinner and celebrating my husband birthday in August 19th at 6.00 pm . I wrote a message to a restaurant. When we came the hostess told to our waiter that we having birthday dinner. In addition,  in the middle of our dinner I reminded our waiter about birthday. But we didn't get nothing not some small desert with a candle or little discount or free drink for  even  simple saying Happy Birthday.  I am very disappointed about the service this time. Wr will think again in the future  if The Keg is a good place for having our birthday celebration dinners. 

Thank you,
Rita",3
Amazing food and great atmosphere just a perfect nice,4
"Standard Keg; food is good, pricing is consistent with being downtown, great patio, service pretty attentive.",2
"great food , great service and good environment 

really enjoyed the whole experience",4
"We have mixed reviews on our visit tot he Keg. Our waiter was friendly and helpful, but after our drinks were delivered we didn't see him for quite a while. Our salad came and bread was promised but it didn't show for about half an hour. We were starting to wonder if they had forgotten about us. Finally our main course arrived. I thought it was worth the wait. My steak was delicious and cooked just right with mushrooms, onions and peppers on the side and very good fries. My husband had prime rib which he thought was average. He described his asparagus as tasteless. Neither of us had room for dessert. The horse radish served with the prime rib was super, super hot. A heads up would have been appreciated.",2
My friend & I were having an early dinner post matinee play.  The food was delicious and the service was just right.,4
"Had a wonderful experience at the Keg. Ordered the top sirloin with mashed potatoes and my date had the filet mignon with baked potatoes. Both options were amazing and left us wanting for more. The bread they serve at the beginning is warm and crispy and easily one of the best breads I've had at a restaurant. Our waitress was lovely, super helpful and very attentive. She made our dinner even more enjoyable. Only a little disappointed when we got an email from Open Table stating we didn't honor our reservation because the hostess forgot to record our attendance in their system. But overall, had a fantastic experience while at The Keg and will be coming back.",3
Food and service were on point when we went. Really enjoyed our experience!,4
I have never had a bad meal at any Keg and this meal was the same.  The Keg is always my preference for a nice dinner.,4
"Great food. We asked for a quote place, we got exactly what we wanted. The only negative point was the service, not very efficient. 2 hours and 1/2 for a 3 course dinner... the good think is that we had plenty of time for discussion!",3
"We reserved The Keg on York St as it was our anniversary and we were also going to the theatre afterwards. The hostess knew right away that we had booked through Open Table and wished us a happy anniversary, as did the lady who took us to our table and our server. We had a very nice little booth in a good spot and though it was busy, it was not noisy at all. We split the escargot and lobster gratinee appetizers and had a sirloin steak with bernaise sauce for dinner. Everything was delicious! Then our server brought us a huge piece of their signature Billy Miner pie, on the house, for our anniversary. We couldn't have asked for a better place to have our dinner and will definitely go back again. When we do, we will absolutely book through Open Table, as we got a reservation for the time we wanted and were shown to our table right away!",4
As usual a great lunch. Everything was as expected.,3
Great lunch spot for business occasions.  Service was excellent.,3
Meets all other Keg standards. Food was great. Reservation was honored on time.,4
"Service was good,  but we felt rushed.  The server was efficient but didn't recognize that we wanted to have a leisurely dinner. (There werent any line ups/ people waiting, so I think she may have been accommodating the kitchen, more than us...).  Better than slow service, I suppose...",3
"My husband I frequent Keg restaurants wherever we are as they are usual dependable in food and service, but the last few times we have visited, we have been disappointed.  The servers appear to be just doing a job and do not make any effort to engage or show that they care whether you are there or not...except when you ask for the bill and then the speed of which it is delivered is very quick indeed.  The food is okay but even the meat is not exceptional.  Just not what it used to be.",0
Excellent steak cooked perfectly. Waiter was also excellent and the wine went down very well. They even provided a free dessert for the birthday boy.,3
Up to the night I ate at Corporate Keg Aurora Keg was my favourite. It still is great but not as great as your Keg . It just seamed everything tasted better. I own my own catering company called Big Doug's BBQ Catering and when I go out to eat I really look forward to it. The Keg is where I go because I know I won't be disappointed. Thankyou and keep up the great customer service. Cheers  Big Dougb,4
"Our steaks tasted funny and old.  The Keg is pretty reputable, this may be a one off, but still disappointing.",0
Was able to make a reservation easily after a Jays game as the restaurant is comfortably away from the post game crowds but still easily walkable. Food and service were great.,3
Horribly rude hostess who has no business working in the service industry.,1
Very accommodating of food allergies. Much better than most restaurants.,4
"Nice meal, attentive enough to respect a business lunch",3
The service was impeccable... the steak and prime rib was prepared perfectly and delicious. Nice ambiance and not too noisy to conduct business. I was pleasantly surprised as the quality.,4
"Get the baked brie, it's delicious. The horseradish is extremely hot, learned the hard way!",4
The food was amazing and service was fantastic,4
"Great service, great food and all with my family on Father's Day.",4
"I ordered the Oscar: steak, shrimp and scallops. The shrimp were minuscule, the same you receive in fried rice takeout. My plate was also missing a side of potatoes. My date had to send back her steak (asked for medium-rare, was served bloody red rare). $100 for dinner and drinks, definitely *not* worth it at this Keg location.",2
"Excellent at accomodating reervation due to traffic from out of town. Very pleasant staff. Kitchen and waiter were extrememly cautious, communicative and careful with preparing gluten free meals. Ensured everything was taken care of. Will definitely be coming back again!",4
"Great steak, lovely wine.Wait staff attentive, informative but not pushy or hovering.",4
"Our server was fast but the service was slow as we waited quite a while, at least 25 minutes to get our food. We were starving by then. Overall food was amazing and the tuna was very fresh! üëå üòä",3
"You always get what you expect to get. The keg offers a slightly above average steak house experience with some fairly good seafood options. Not a Wow, but never a disappointment.  A go to option! This location offers a great hidden patio!",4
Good but not great. I went there because close to ballet,3
"The food is always good.  The steaks are great.  The manager comped our desserts because my steak was overly peppery, but not to the extent that I couldn't eat it.  That was gracious of them.",4
"Outstanding steaks, excellent service and good drinks.  What else could you ask for?",4
"The KEG, is awesome, on so many levels.

From the warm reception by the Front-Of-House Staffers and the prompt seating at our assigned table; to the superb service by our Server ""Deanna""............Awesome.

The Keg Martinis were perfect and were a perfect match to the App's..

We ordered our favorite Steaks and they were done, to perfection.


BRAVO !",4
"Everything excellent except for two exceptions. The lettuce was very tough not young and tender as it usually was.

The Cosmo was a big ball of ice and very little liquid.",4
"Wonderful lunch. I ordered the French onion soup and house salad with 6 ounce sirloin. I replaced the blue cheese with feta and thought it was delicious. Service was friendly and fast. Atmosphere is dimly lit, cozy yet great for a business lunch. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Always good, always consistent.",4
"Service as always was good but I ordered an end cut of Prime Rib which had no taste - little or no spices on the outside ( usually at least pepper crusted) and it was tough even though it came medium to medium rare. Didn't enjoy it at all. 
Prawn/shrimp cocktail was huge and would have been great but was just a little under cooked. All in all the worst meal I have had at the Keg and over the years I have eaten at different Keg restaurants many times..",2
My roast beef was tough. Accompanying salad lacked flavour. Overall disappointing.,1
Waitress must of been having a bad day as she appeared quite frustrated with our questions and the food took FOREVER to get to our table!,2
"An enjoyable early dinner - 5:30 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. The 4 of us had drinks, salads and entrees followed by coffee. We were not rushed start and end our two courses so we had plenty of time to catch up and chit-chat.
Service was great from welcoming to departing.",4
Always a great time at The Keg. They NEVER disappoint!,4
Kitchen needs a bit of work. Most of our steaks were not done to specification which I have never experienced before. The wait staff was awesome and attentive to food allergies.,3
Outstanding place and food was very good.   Service was goid and ambiance was ok.,4
"Gutes Steakhouse, Weinpreise f√ºr Kanada sehr moderat.  Weinkarte recht gut sortiert.",3
"This time was good but not as good as previous times. Food seemed a little under par in comparison to usual. Server initially challenged it but then corrected it, although it could have been handled better.",2
Great place with an amazing food,4
Consistent food quality.,4
The Keg never disappoints. They have great food at decent prices. The service is terrific. A wonderful place to go before the hockey game and not spend a fortune.,3
A fairly busy location that won't forget about you. I ordered a rare sirloin with blue cheese crust and it did not disappoint- cooked properly and brought to the table in a reasonable amount of time.,3
The server was rude and short. We were having a business lunch and we all found the server to be terrible at his job.,2
"The Keg, never fails to deliver on Good Food, Excellent Service and an ambiance that's conducive to all.

From the warm welcome at the Front of House, prompt seating and an enjoyable dining experience; The Keg makes it happen.
Some food snobs tend to dismiss the Keg as just another chain; but I beg to differ.

BRAVO !",4
As per usual the food was excellent. Not too loud and the staff are all so friendly.,4
Fantastic place for a romantic night out or a business dinner,4
The Keg is always a great place for dinner.  Top quality steaks and side plates.,4
we had an excellent time. The meal was sumptuous... everything we've come to expect while dining at the Keg.,4
Love the prime rib,3
We came for dinner after a matinee theatre show. Great service and food.,4
The staff at the 165 York Street location in Toronto was very pleasant and professional. Love the ambience at that location. I was a bit disappointed with the Dungeness crab and Asparagus was overcooked. The Escargot however was amazing. I've eaten at the Keg many times and usually order the steak which was always cooked to my desired temperature.,3
"The Keg is the Keg.  You know you're going to get a decent, consistent, corporate market tested meal.  You will never be surprised or delighted at The Keg, but they have upped their game in their selection of steak cuts, and veg.  The Keg is like that episode of Seinfeld you catch while you're channel cruising, you've seen it a million times, but it's comforting and you'll watch it again for the tenth time.  It's a good meal, their brand is obviously successful but there are much better steaks to be had in the city.",2
The Keg always provides good value and service.  I really enjoyed my roast beef sandwich and salad.  The mini desserts are also very tasty.,4
Great food. Steaks and seafood were terrific. Crab was especially good. Dessert was also spectacular.,4
"I tried the filet mignon at other Keg locations but it was over cooked and dry, this location was cooked perfectly.",3
"Had a simply delightful evening!! Celebrating my husband's birthday and entire experience from our walking through the door until we left 2 hours later was wonderful. Food great! Service was outstanding. Thanks to Chad for attentive and excellent service. 
Looking forward to seeing you all again soon.",4
"Loved thr place, staff and manager was very profesional and friendly",4
"Everything was great! We came 30 minutes early, but didn't have to wait and were given a table right away. The service and food was good with one exception... My Tuna Tacos were cold. Not sure if it was supposed to be served cold, but I think it would taste better warm.  I loved the Baked Brie. For dessert we had Billy Miner's Pie/Mocha ice cream cake, which was a wonderful ending for our dinner!  Would definitely recommend this to all my friends and would love to come back soon...",3
We dined here with a gift card my wife received for Christmas. I have always enjoyed the food. It was perfect for our Maple Leaf game night date.,3
Perfect meal in a perfect ambient. Nice staff!  Thank you for a great evening to meet an old friend and to celebrate our 33rd anniversary.,4
Great food and the back section had a great atmosphere. Reliable for a nice a dinner. We had a slight mishap with change of servers and a request we had put in but they were apologetic.,3
"Only one small problem, they had NO Bread.  Should have been more prepared for Family Day
Weekend",3
Always know what to expect..good food..great portions..excellent server (Thanks Mary),3
"Restaurant messed up our order twice. Due to allergies, specified no mushrooms with steak, and they brought the steak with mushrooms. When it was brought back, the steak was raw ! No kidding, I got a raw steak at the Keg ! After third try, they got it right. They took a lot off the bill and waitress felt really bad, not her fault, but I hope they were not trying to kill us. And this is not a joke review ! Your servers can verify. I will therefore not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Sunday, Feb. 19 around 6:00 pm.  You can check, if you want. Expect something on Tripadvisor shortly.",2
"Standard pre meal bread was not available because they ran out... Come on... no excuse, and where was the offer to provides something in place of what would normally be offered. Wife' s ""medium"" steak was overcooked close to well done and very tough when I tried a piece. My medium rare was about medium and not very tasty.  We have had the same experience now at Keg's in Newmarket, London and Toronto.  Not going to Keg any more after many years of enjoying the experience. Request for a booth or nicer table was ignored and placement in a high traffic, not so private area was a bit shabby, especially when it was obvious there were a few booths available. Reservations for an earlier dinner should have helped.",2
We had a very pleasant experience & I would like to add the waitress was amazing. She was very courtious & extremely polite. I can honestly say that I have been dining at the keg for 20 years & have never had a bad experience. The food is always great cooked to perfection.,4
Was solid always for lunch meeting. Sat in the back which is not my favourite but meal was good and service was great. Had the burger.  Solid.,3
Great Service and wonderful food. Great Ambience and quick service,4
"Our Server Mary was absolutely terrific and made our dining experience wonderful. Food was excellent and well prepared.

The layout of the restaurant is well designed and provides a quiet place to talk no matter where you sit.

Also, we like using Open Table for our reservation. It was easy and convenient and our requests were accommodated. Great experience all around!",4
"Hostess was rude and server was pretentious. Celebrating spouse's birthday which I noted previously in the reservation. But they did not ask if I was celebrating any special occasion although I did hear her ask other tables. Hostess spoke to us rudely as we walked in, she said ""how many?"", I said I had a reservation which she replied ""what?"", she then just led us to our aisle seat and walked off without saying anything. I suspect it was because I was not in a full business suit on casual Fridays. I am a finance professional with a top 5 Canadian Bank.",1
"I was pleasantly surprised that the entire experience was perfect - great table, fantastic servers, decent wine list (not pricey at all!), and delicious food!! They made my Birthday dinner memorable and my first visit to this location will definitely not be my last!",4
"I was so annoyed that the bartenders kept throwing away my half-full drinks. When I finally complained, one of the bartenders gave me a free drink to make up for it, but it shouldn't have happened in the first place.",2
"prime rib was cooked to medium rare.  my ""medium order"" was closer to well.  flavours were just okay.  My 10 oz piece was significantly smaller than my dining mates 10oz piece.",1
"The green beans on my meal looked like they were made a week previous. The mash needed serious seasoning and why was the plate so effing hot?! When would that ever be necessary?

AND...The caeser salad was pitiful!  A supermarket bag salad is better than the keg caeser. 

Only plus was our server.  Great dude.  Wish I could remember his name.",1
"FRESH FOOD & SERVICE MAKES THIS VENUE NO 1 IN THE CHAIN !

The Keg is always consistent on delivery of great Food and Service.

From the initial warm reception at the front of house, to prompt seating at our designated table; the entire dining experience was exceptional.

Jess (Our Server) was very knowledgeable about Wines and was very attentive to our needs.
The Food arrived and was cooked to our liking.

This particular Keg is N0. 1 in the chain and strives to remain on top.........BRAVO !",4
"Always enjoy coming to this location. Unfortunately, not all Kegs are created equal (I'm looking at you, Yong & Eg) ... but this location is consistently excellent!",4
Excellent food and very good service.  Split between a nosier bar area and a quieter dining room.,4
I introduced a colleague to The Keg for a lunch meeting.  It took 45 minutes for our food to come - and we both only ordered salads (with a side order of sweet potato fries).  Both of us were late for our after-lunch appointments.  I would NOT recommend this location for a business lunch again.  Most people only have one hour for lunch.  If it takes 45 minutes for your food to come - it's not acceptable.,1
"Loved the steak, ribs, mushrooms, potatoes, etc. Great comfortable booth, not noisy, Server Coral was efficient, caring and helpful. Will come again. Too bad they don't help with underground parking costs.",4
"From start to finish everything was amazing
We will be back soon",4
We really enjoyed it. It was my birthday and honestly it was the best birthday celebration I ever had. Lia was really kind. Dont skip sangrias . They are wonderful. The steaks were deliciouse. Great great night. I 100% recommend it.,4
"We were in Toronto to attend the boat show.  We were looking for a good restaurant, with a nice ambiance near the hotel. The Keg was perfect for us.  Good food, nice atmosphere and reasonably priced.  Can't go wrong with The Keg!",3
Out for a friends birthday.  Food and service were excellent,3
"Service and food were excellent. My only complaint is my water glass could have been filled more frequently, and that's a really minor nit-pick.",4
Convenient location and delicious menu options!  Great service too!,3
"My clients picked this restaurant as a place close to where they worked. The food was fine: nothing wrong with it, nothing special about it. Nice wine list. Prices were somewhat expensive, but not out of line for that part of town. Waitress was very attentive. Talking was difficult as it was VERY noisy and the tables were wide, so I had to lean WAY across my food in order to hear what anyone was saying. Not much more to say, it was pretty average.",2
We went at 16:00 Sunday - opening time. They had us wait outside in VERY cold conditions rather than let us sit in the designated waiting area which wasn't ideal. Food was a tasty and economical effort for a chain restaurant. If having a more private or special occasion definitely reserve an area nearer the fires or mention it to staff who will accommodate. All in all a pretty OK steak restaurant experience. Not one I'd necessarily recommend if in Toronto a short period of time.,3
"Great food, nice atmosphere and good value for your money - especially for wine!",4
"Great location, good service, good wines, excelent food!",4
"We went on New Year's Eve to enjoy an early dinner. It was very busy when we arrived, but we were seated right away. It took about 15 minutes for the waitress to bring us our bread, which was brought to us about 2 minutes before our appetizer came. Our steak and prime rib were amazing, but the service could have been better. The waitress was rude, and we felt very rushed to complete our meal. Overall not bad, but definitely does not make for a romantic setting.",2
food was exceptional and the service was great. our table was ready for us when we arrived (20 mins early).,4
Great place for steak dinner.   Place is busy and they can handle busy.   Service was excellent.  Steak was delicious.   Best part.  I think  this is the only Keg in Downtown Toronto that accepts reservations on Friday nights.   Tip.  Use open table to reserve.  And parking was a breeze   Underground.,4
Noise level is quiet depending on where you are seated. Closer to the bar is quite noisy.,4
"The Keg is always predictable - predictably good! New, young, fancy chefs and their trendy restaurants come and go, but the Keg consistently nails everything. Smooth greeting/seating, speedy ordering, appropriate lighting/music levels, well-prepared food. If you are lucky enough to be served by Kit at this location, consider yourself blessed.",3
"The restaurant is very good. Beer and food delicious. But I do not know what happened that our beef had too much pepper. We were starving so we ate, but it was spicy.",4
Always good food. York st location has the best ambiance! Felt very chain like this visit - rushed to order without time to enjoy a drink.  Salad came out within 2 minutes of ordering. Clearly prepped way ahead and sitting. Would prefer a more relaxed meal with time to enjoy. I usually reserve a later sitting for this reason so we'really not holding up a table but despite this it was a rushed dining experience at first. Knowledgeable about wines and helping make steak choice decision.,3
Great place to have a lunch prior to matinee at four seasons centre,3
Delicious food! Excellent service from wait staff!,4
"Great food, service and atmosphere.",4
I always like eating at The Keg.  It was my first visit to that location.  The place was very busy.  I am glad I had reservations.  The staff and the food were excellent!!!!  You always get great value when you eat at the Keg!,4
Really enjoyed my meal.  The steak was excellent and the service was great!,4
"Service was excellent. As there were several Christmas parties going on, they came around to see how we were doing with noise level etc.  We were fine. They updated us on when meal was coming and checked to see if food was okay. Food was very good - the horseradish was very hot.
Overall, we enjoyed our meal.",4
"The waitress was amazing
The food was excellent
Recommend highly",4
"the heating is variable across the restaurant, very draughty in some areas.",3
"We normally dine at The Keg Mansion, so we were a little bit skeptical about this location, let alone the ambiance.  All in all, it was a  delightful evening.  Our food was delicious.  The steaks were cooked to perfection. We had a very prompt and courteous server.  A very pleasant evening, and certainly not what we had anticipated. We will most certainly be back!",3
"I've been to many Kegs before but I have to say this one's my favorite. Their feature right now, the 20 oz tbone is to die for. The meat just melts in your mouth. We went for my fiance's birthday and both had a great time. Our servers name was Chris so I'd just like to give him a shout-out cause he was amazing! Thanks for an awesome time. We'll definitely be back! :)",4
"The service was excellent, even with the place being completely full.
Food was cooked perfectly as usual.  Would go to this location again.",4
"Can't beat the Keg for value.  We had our grandchildren along and all had great meals, delivered in a timely manner, as we were off to the pantomime afterwards.  My wife left her (not cheap) scarf - they found it, called us and it was there when we called back later in the evening.",4
The apps and mains were delicious and generous.  Service was excellent.,4
"Service is normally good but this instance there was a long delay to get table even with reservation and even longer wait to get food, my friends were not happy about this experience either. Not sure if we want to go back any time soon.",1
"The restaurant is very busy during lunch, and after order.. it took almost an hour to get the food.  The food was delicious, although the plates (portion size and sides) were not consistent.  A regular lunch took almost 2 hours.",3
"Had a great time as per usual.  Service was excellent, food did not disappoint!",3
"Fabulous food, service and ambiance for a special occasion - highly recommend!",3
"Definitely a HOT spot downtown after work.
As busy as it was, the service was great and attentive.  Food was well timed and hot.
Definitely will go back again!",4
The staff were very friendly and professional. The restaurant has a good ambiance and it was the perfect setting for my sons birthday. I appreciated that the birthday dessert was brought to the table without being asked.,4
"Splendid location, good food, great service, very vibrant, modern, happening and classic ambiance. Highly recommend this chain and location.",4
Arrived 10 minutes before reservation and were seated immediately.  The bar area we walked through was huge and packed with patrons.  It was extremely loud and we couldn't hear each other or the server.  Food was very good but my main course was delivered before I was finished my salad.,3
"The restaurant was very busy and we were seated on time with our reservation. The person showing us our table unfortunately bumped me and spilled my red wine on my white shirt, the manager took care of everything. the food was very good and we were not pushed to turn the table.",3
"I was very impressed with everything about this restaurant! It was my first time dining here and it was perfect! Our waiter was excellent, food was perfect, the ambiance was perfect for the occasion, it was the middle of December and cold outside and It was very comfortable inside. I will definitely be returning to dine here again!",4
Our server was Ebony..She was AMAZING !!! She checked on us at appropriate times and was very friendly and attentive...She made our evening :),4
Overall my family and I had a good experience at the Keg. It continues to be one of our favourite restaurants.,3
"food was cold and did not taste good, this is the 2nd or 3rd time we have had terrible food at this location, wont go back",0
"Excellent steak as usual to Keg's standards, but missed the vegetable side dish which was no longer available.",3
I enjoyed my food from Keg.  You know what you will receive and the quality is the same no matter what location you go to.  My steak was perfectly cooked and the garlic mashed potatoes are delicious.,3
"Arrived with a reservation after attending the Grey Cup game. We were told to sit where ever there was an empty table. Restaurant was not even 1/4 full and you could see the restaurant was winding down.  This didn't make sense to us as Grey Cup is a one off special event and they should be winding up (our experiences at the Keg after attending the Grey Cup in Vancouver and Winnipeg).  Ordered drinks and food (as kitchen was closing) and drinks did not arrive for 25 minutes.  Asked server after 15 minutes about our drinks (as she flew by our table) and in a rude and condescending tone, told us that they were very busy and we would have to be patient.  Other people heard her talk to us and immediately left the restaurant as they knew they were not going to get served.  Drinks finally came and food immediately after, no bread, no apologies......nothing. Enough was enough, I let the manager have it, pointing out the rude and arrogant staff member and the dismal service. Manager was very apologetic and took care of our bill for food and drinks, after we finished our meal.  At least the steak was excellent!!  Service sucked.  No more Toronto Kegs for us. We'll take our business and appetites elsewhere.",0
"Great ambience.       Good cocktails, wine by glass offerings could be expanded.    A bit disappointed with the steak, really undercooked had to be sent back for more cooking,  but when we got the steak the texture was poor and chewy.   Not a good piece of meat.   Overall we enjoyed the experience but was disappointed with the steak and no comps offered.  That being said we would give it another chance or go for appetizers and drinks only",2
Service was excellent. We did not feel rushed. Food was excellent!,4
The usual Keg experience.  Excellent food with good service.  I expect nothing less.,3
"Le Keg is always consistent, for both Food and Service.
Sometimes, there is a disconnect between the Kitchen and the Bar and Food orders do tend to go astray.

Great ambience and buzz, especially when the Financial Personnel tend to linger on.

The Steaks are always done to perfection.

BRAVO !",3
"Great Night...great service. My dinner was awesome as usual-my wife's dinner was a bit disappointing to her but we told Jess-our server who in turn told Nancy, the Manager and they bent over backwards to make it all right (which they did!)
    Kudos to Lee on having a great and responsive team. We will definitely be back soon and consider this just a very small hiccup in the standard of excellence that The Keg can be counted on for....",4
The food is always consistent and good.  The classic menu is good value for money.  Staff are helpful and pleasant.,4
"We've eaten here quite often on our Toronto Get-Aways.  The service is always friendly and efficient and the prime rib cooked to perfection.  The baked potato was a little overdone.
We appreciated the free birthday dessert complete with candle.  We've made a reservation for December 11 on our next weekend in Toronto and a celebration of our wedding anniversary.",4
"Amazing best meal We ever had.
Can't wait to go back 

Please
Consider opening restaurant in PEI",4
"Excellent, highly recommended!!!",4
Service was slow - it took 50 minutes for us to be served.  Way too slow for lunch...,1
The New York steak wa just great. Actually as well as everything. Thanks :),4
Great meal with my wife and son. Consistently good food in a lively atmosphere,3
Went with a friend for a girls night haven't been to the Keg in awhile and really loved it.  Service was great and food was delivious.  Steak was cooked perfectly and everything arrived in a very timely manner.  Would definitely go back in fact I can't wait!,4
"I've been to The Keg on York Street as well as the one at The Mansion on Jarvis many times over the years and once to The Keg in Halifax, and this restaurant chain has never disappointed. Their steaks are terrific for the price, which is a lot less than at some of the oher steak places you find.  The staff is always accommodating.  And the best part is the delicious Bloody Caesars!  My god, they are fantastic at The Keg.",4
"It was the first time at the Keg at York Street. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We would recommend this location to our friends, too.",4
We were pleased to see that the wait staff are now allowed to wear low heels.,4
Excellent all around. Prices are a little high for a casual dinner. Food & service were great.,3
"Been here for many times, always comfortable",4
"We have this as a meeting place because its convenient for our family as some come from Bowmanville,  Barrie,  Brampton and some live downtown.  The Keg is always the same, we can all get things we like there is a good variety.",3
Food and service were great.  A bit pricey but everything in downtown Toronto is pricey.,3
"Food was very delicious as well as drinks. Everything was delivered promptly and in good taste. 

Would definitely go back over and over again. Very satisfied.  üòä",4
Great atmosphere and the food was really good,4
Our anniversary in our Toronto was made special by a special meal at the Keg last weekend.The food was very good value for the quality and the wines also lovely yet reasonable in price.,3
We have eaten at this restaurant many times and have been satisfied with the meals.  This time we were disappointed.  The steaks were tough and not very good.  The 4 members of our group found the same thing.  Hopefully this was just an off night and not a sign of a change in the product.,2
"This Keg is always busy.
Note that the bar area can be quite noisy.  So if you want a quiet table ask for one away from the bar.
Standard Keg fare - steaks and prime rib are always good here.",2
"Excellent value for the money.  We had a lovely 2009 Chile wine.  My steak was excellent.  The service was good.  Hostess very kindly gave us a booth.  Overall, a great dinner.",3
Waitress was excellent!  Food and service was good.,4
"Great staff and food but they forgot our bread, brought my friend sweet potato fries instead of regular fries (although they did bring her a plate of regular fries within minutes) and brought us cream instead of the milk requested for our tea and coffee. The mocha ice cream cake was to die for.",2
You can never go wrong with a Keg meal! Great steaks & friendly service.,3
Really amazing food and fabulous service. I recommend the sirloin steak and the ice-berg wedge salad! I will definitely return for another meal.,4
"Good food, good service.   We were able to have a conversation without shouting at each other - that is paramount on my list.  Two thumbs up!",4
"this restaurant was my first experience in Toronto
that was good and charm
and I have good feeling about toronto and your restaurant

Nice staff, nice food",3
"The food and service were excellent.  We had a very nice, quiet table.  Both of us have different food allergies about which they were extremely serious and attentive.  Obviously, all of their staff are well and properly trained on this.  The food was good and good value for the money when compared with similar steakhouses.  We are definitely going back.",4
Was great and same as other KEG I go indifferent places in Canada,4
"all was going good, the steak was cooked just right, the lobster tail was yummy....But then i bit into an asparagus  and boy I was surprised.  It was beyond el andante, I would say, raw.  The coleslaw as advertised was just shredded cabbage .  Very disappointing, as I skip having an appetizer expecting to have complete meal.  oh yes they did bring me a cooked veggies, about 10 minutes after I finished the meat, note I did wait 10 minutes hoping to enjoy the veggies with my meat.  All in all, not sure what to say.....",3
"We were heading to  concert in terms city and decided to have a nice dinner prior to the event. We were seated quickly after our reservation was found,service was quick and food was amazing.",4
James was an excellent  server; he should be recognized!,3
"As usual, The Keg did not disappoint for our friend, Dawn's, birthday dinner!",3
"I was looking for a good steakhouse for our trip to Toronto, and this place seemed to be pretty well recommended.  Overall, not a bad place, just not anything special.  My wife's martini was only 2/3 full, my son's steak (baseball sirloin) was tough and barely warm.  The appetizers (calamari and stuffed mushrooms) were ok, but again, nothing special.  My steak was done nicely, and a much nicer cut of meat (sirloin as well). I think the place is a bit overpriced, and I can't compare fairly what would have been, meal wise, but for the price we could have had dinner for 3 in the CN tower, with a view....",2
We enjoy coming here because there is something to suit everyone's tastes.  The cocktails list is good and a great value.  The entrees are always served to our liking and the desert is great too!,3
Great care with allergy details.,4
"I met a business collea guest for lunch on the outdoor patio. The food, wine, service and atmosphere was excellent. I would highly recommend the Keg to anyone.",4
"We were disturbed by an out of control child whose mother/carer was seated nearby at the bar.
This child even climbed on our bench seat to jump up and down.
 We had to ask to move tables to a good distance away. Even then disturbance
continued and we noted other diners were also upset. Although staff were present in numbers
no one did anything even when the child sat at the bar (highly inappropriate) and caused a plate to smash on the floor. Management should have intervened and asked the lady and child to leave.
We are not against children in restaurants and have indeed taken our own to many from when they were infants.

The meals we had were unremarkable, bearing in mind the prices,and not up to the standard we were led to expect. The background ""music"" was very strange and overly intrusive.

. Does your management ever listen to what is played?  On a better note service was great and the wine was good but overpriced.  

Overall a disappointing experience.",1
Very  nice meal would definitely go back. My husband and daughter both ordered steak cooked perfectly.I had  thai chicken which came with asparagus which was just the way I prefer it and rice which wasn't so great a bit overdone  and stuck in lumps very chewy but for he most part a very good meal.,3
"The best thing about the Keg is its consistency, food is always excellent and service is always great.",4
I sat at the bar and had the ribeye steak.  It was ok quite nice.  The service at the door was very attentive. At the bar so so.  No real complaints it might present better in the main restaurant which looked nice.,2
"We had a wonderful experience at The Keg on Saturday celebrating a special birthday. The food was delicious - prime rib and steak - and the waiter was professional yet personable, a great combination. The California greens salad was exceptional but a must share as it is dinner size.  I finished off with the mini brownie which was just the perfect size after a generous portioned meal. We will certainly return again!",4
"Was very happy with the service and food, when a food allergy was mentioned the staff were very helpful in selecting the proper menu items.",4
This was my first time dining at The Keg Steakhouse. My wife and I were celebrating our 3 year wedding anniversaryanniversary in Toronto. I thought this would be a very high end type of place like the Capital Grille or Ruth Chris but the extra level of customer service was not there. My water was only filled a few times and it seems our waitress wasnt around for us to ask her. The food was ok but not fantasic but the drinks i ordered was good. Overall it was a 3.8 out of 5.0. I wish i would have went to Ruth Chris however its always fun to try something new.,3
Stephen was a very friendly & attentive server. The food was very good though a bit pricey.,3
"We were in Toronto for a mini vacation and always treat ourselves to a good steak meal. The Keg is always a favourite. We booked our reservations online through OpenTable. Unfortunately when we arrived there was no record of our reservation. We showed the hostess our confirmation email and she quickly arranged a table for us, dispute it being a busy weekend evening! A big thank you to all the staff and especially to the service minded hostess!

But I would suggest the reason for the missing reservation be looked into. It could have been a mess if some less service inclined person had been in charge.",4
Server was excellent!!!,4
"Ribs were okay, the Surf and Turf and lobster month specials quite good. Service was excellent. Patio is really nice and vibrant.",3
"We went for my sister's birthday and it was her first time there.  The evening was wonderful.  Our server was amazing, the food was great and the restaurant wasn't too busy as we went for an earlier dinner to skip most of the crowds.  Five stars for this location.",4
"Service was excellent right from the start.  Our waiter was also excellent.  My wife and I are both from Nova Scotia and we were vacationing in Toronto for that week.  Having a 3 year old son and with my wife expecting again, we wanted to take advantage of having a date night away without a toddler.  As stated above, the service was great.  The only disappointment that night, was that someone pulled the fire alarm in the building and the loud noise made it very difficult to enjoy our evening.",3
I was so disappointed with this restaurant. It did not live up the the KEG name across Canada at all! The new York Strip Loin steak was not great and the prime rib was undercooked.The fire alarm went off halfway through our meal and stayed on for the rest of the time we were there. It was a big Disappointment!The manager tried to blame the quality of the meal on the Tragically Hip concert as they had been extremely busy prior to our reservation.,0
"great night as always,  the Key never disappoints :)",4
Food was great.  Lobster tacos.  Yummy.  Server could have been more attentive.,3
Everything was great! My boys loved it! It was the first time at the keg for them . They are 17 &  18. So they said it was awesome  thanks so much eh,4
Comfortable ambient. Prime rib was cooked just right and juicy. Complimented with baked potato and deep fried onion strips. Enjoyed the great service and our waitress was attentive to our needs.,3
"I met a work colleague for lunch and sat outside on the patio.  I've been at the Keg many times and it was good.  Our waitress, Tatiana, was exceptional.  She was very attentive, provided suggestions, very friendly -- overall excellent.",3
Excellent service. Food took a while because of high number of customers and manager comped entire bill.,4
"LE KEG never fails to deliver
They strive for consistency in both, Quality and Service and this is very noticeable.

We continue to meet up with repeat Customers, who tend to flock to this Venue; especially on Friday Nights.

The Multi-Million Dollar Patio, is awesome for outdoor dining and the Outdoor Furniture is very conducive to being at Home.

All around, a great dining experience.",4
"We enjoyed sitting outside on the patio on a warm summer's evening.  However we didn't plan for such a long dinner.  The food was very slow and in the end when it did arrive, it has clearly been sitting for a while.  The manager gave us a complimentary round of drinks to apologize for the long wait, which was nice. But I would have just preferred to get the meal in an appropriate time.",2
"Very enjoyable environment
Nice services
good taste food, especially the billy miner pie
salad need to be improved 
over all is outstanding, i love it and i am glad that i spent my 18 birthday's dinned there",4
"Best Keg ever!  Great decor and ambiance, 2 lovely patios (we sat outside in the front patio in a comfy booth, then realized there was a larger patio in the back), huge indoor seating for both casual and formal dining preferences, fantastic food and clean and beautiful washrooms.  Definately coming back when we are back in downtown TO.",4
I chose this location to celebrate my 41 st birthday with my wife and 2 children. Unfortunately the sirloin steak dinner I order was very dry. Really disappointed with the steak. All else was fine but as this was our first dinner out as a family in 3 years I was extremely let down.,1
Very much enjoyed the food.  Met with friends...2 had to go back to work and the 2  of us who are retired had a lot of catching up to do.  We did not feel rushed by the staff and found this very refreshing.,3
"Nice place to meet a friend for lunch. Excellent patio. Very good, unobtrusive service.",3
Food was outstanding and service was great. A bit pricey but worth it,4
"The food and service is very good
However avoid sitting at the tables in the lounge / bar area, as they are incredibly uncomfortable. Sitting at the bar or at a high table would probably be a better option.",3
I celebrated my daughter's 25th birthday there. Our steak dinners were excellent and cocktails were great too. Next time I'm in Toronto I will go back for sure.,4
"Great dinner, I had the Black Cod which was excellent. Wait staff were friendly and efficient. I have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant.",4
"We arrived a bit late for our reservation but all the host were very accommodating, even giving us a choice of table. They were conscious of my special request of a booth and found us a spot that was quiet and perfect for what we needed. We were approached by our lovely server in no time, Nicole, and was very friendly and helpful with assisting us in choosing our dinner. She was very attentive and checked up on us the right amount and always had a smile on her face. In the end, we had a great meal, and a memorable experience. We are definitely sure to return.",4
Thank you very much for the great dinner. It was amazing!!,4
"We sat indoors which was a shame because I wanted to be outdoors at your two spots - it's so beautiful out there but one of the guests found it too hot. The service was terrific and we had a gift card and they were great about it. We shared a bottle of reasonably priced red wine and it's been a long time since I did that and relaxed. I had the pistachio encrusted salmon and the Tuna Tartare. I was in heaven. One person had steak and she's fussy and loved it, and the other one also had the New  York Steak and loved it. We had to bring food home due to the bread! Nice of you to have the Miner's pie too. It made the occasion so special.   I would recommend The Keg over and over esp. for special occasions but even for get togethers. And we're planning one soon!",4
The Keg is always very good and consistent. Excellent steak with no surprises. Ordered my usual - bacon wrapped filet mignon with side salad. The York St location is convenient for downtown business meetings.,4
"very lovely lunch, timeless classic service and ambiance.  Food and service you can count on.",3
waitress should smile a bit more...  maybe appear a bit more alive,3
"I wasn't quite sure who our server was, we started off with a server who took our beverage order. A different  server took our food order, my girlfriend ordered a keg classic dinner and her steak temperature was perfect. I ordered the keg classic prime rib dinner. I enjoy my steak medium, but our server (1 of 2) suggested a medium rare temperature, otherwise it would be dry she said. I received my order and it was medium well. So I asked for a new one. The manager dropped off the new steak which was a lot better but not medium rare. The restaurant bought us a round of drinks because we were running late for our movie (super nice of them). However, it was our 10th year anniversary and ate separately. üëéüèΩ",2
"Hostess was not nice but other than that, exceptional",4
"We were charged regular price for escargot during happy hour on a Saturday,  told server who assured us it didn't  apply but it did",2
Service was top notch!! The food was amazing. We had a great experience.,4
"Great service, perfect steak and pleasant ambiance for a special night out.",4
"love the Keg we don't have one where I live so when I travel I normally try to eat there, great consistent food",4
Good was awesome. Steak was cooked perfectly. Waitress was great. Always there when you needed something. Biggest keg I have ever been to.,4
"This Keg restaurant is a great setting with a great bar, seating inside and out that suits both good and bad weather.    Well located in downtown Toronto with parking underground below restaurant.  Found the staff friendly and attentive.  We sat outside on the street side of the restaurant near the main entrance.  One problem was someone started to smoke outside the door on the other side of the fence and the smoke drifted in.  The waiter asked the individual to move further away without being asked.  If we had sat further away from the entrance or at the outside patio at the back this would not have happened.",3
The Keg is like the Canadian version of Ruth's Chris. I wasn't blown away but steak is steak!,3
Great food and excellent service.  Would recommend to others and will return.,4
"Was very impressed with the atmosphere and food! 10/10 from me personally, but the server we had was not the greatest. He was nice and I didnt have a problem with his service until we were leaving and we overheard him complaining about the amount of tip we left him which was extremely offensive since we left a decent size tip. For the amount we are paying to eat at the Keg I would expect better service from the waiters/waitresses",3
AMAZING restaurant and the manager is exceptional!!! Made reservations from Chicago and manager and staff ensures that the private room was setup without a hitch! Everyone was very pleased and I was happy!!!,4
"What a great atmosphere!  There is a nice combination of elegance and comfort.  The place is lively, yet fosters a romantic atmosphere.  The menu offers a good variety.  I opted for escargot and ribs - both were excellent!",4
"I loved the location of this Keg. In a quiet secluded part of downtown Toronto. The patio was at the back was in a courtyard surrounded by tall buildings but not noisy at all. It was romantic, tasteful and overall exquisite. Highly recommend!",4
"Service was awesome!  Jessica truly served our table like a professional!  She had tones of charm and great recommendations, you could tell she knew the menu well!  Thank you!!!",4
"Always consistently good!
They really know how to prepare a steak!!",3
"We had an allergy at our table and i love how the manager comes over and explains how things are cooked and what ingredients are used, etc.",4
Not to their usual standard so disappointed.  A compt'd meal doesn't make up for a ruined evening,0
"The restaurant looks very nice, and we got a quiet table. There was a lot of seafood in the appetizer options and I have dietary restrictions. The wine and salads were tasty. The mains were the most disappointing because the steaks were not that great. They were a bit on the tough side and not a lot of flavor.  We were given a special icecream cake to celebrate the occasion, which was a very nice touch. Melanie was our server, and she was great! Thanks for making our dinner date so special.",2
Food was delicious and perfect portion size. Well presented. Pleasing decor and music was at the right level. A very enjoyable meal!,3
"Out of the half-dozen times that I've dined ar the Keg, I've never been disappointed. I wish there was a Keg in my city. Apparently one is coming! I marvel at how consistent this restaurant is. The hostesses are friendly and do their best to accommodate you if there are any unexpected circumstances, or if you arrive and hope for a table although you didn't have a reservation. However, I prefer to have a reservation so that I won't be disappointed if the restaurant is very busy. The wait staff are at your side when you need them, it seems, and don't make a habit of interrupting you many times. The seating is very comfortable. The wine list appeared to have many choices that are guaranteed to please all. I would say though, that the white wine I ordered, by the glass, was a tad too much on the room temperature side. Still delicious though, and I didn't feel like I was being gouged by higher than necessary prices. The bread that is brought to you shortly after you arrive is warm and delicious. I've noticed that the butter is always room temperature and easy to spread. I have to be careful that I don't wold down too much of it! Whether you order a house salad or Caesar salad, they are both so good. Each time I've ordered steak and asked for it to be cooked medium rare, it has been cooked to perfection. I don't know how they manage to be so consistent. The vegetables are fresh, and the mushrooms in particular are quite juicy and tasty. Even if the restaurant is crowded, it never seems to be noisy. The washrooms that I've seen are nice and clean, which for me can make the difference when it comes to repeat visits. The waiter mentioned dessert but didn't push it, and we were thankful that there were mini-dessert items to choose from. We ordered these mini desserts because we still had comfortable bellies, and that's always a sign that your food has been nice and fresh. The bill didn't leave us feeling like we were ripped off in any way, and I can't wait to return to T.O.",4
"Once again we had a great experience at the Keg .  We appreciate very much that the alergies are taken seriously by all staff. The food is always great and well presented.
Thanks again !!",3
"The service was very good. Even though we were teenagers they treated us with the utmost respect. Our waiter answered a question irrelevant to the keg. I had asked her about what to do after our meal. She could not think of anything and the next time she came by she suggested the Eaton Centre. Overall, service was amazing. However, I was very disappointed in the food. All of us ordered different kinds of steak, but I did not like any of them. The dessert was on point. I might come back just for the dessert",3
good steak however the 'all dressed' baked potato was very dry... I should have sent it back,3
"We had Tuna tartar and Onion soup for starters. The Tuna was increadibly good. The onion soup was tasty. For mains we had steaks made to perfection. Dessert was creme brule, which also was fantastic. On The downside the service was on the slow side, but the staff apologized volunterily for this.",3
Always predictably good food accompanied by great service.,3
"Was on a trip with a friend, and we decided to come in for dinner here before our concert. My friend has a severe dairy allergy, which sadly means that less than half the menu is available for him to eat. On the upside, The Keg has a detailed allergy guide on their website, so we knew exactly what the options were before coming in.

We told the server about the allergy, he took our order, and we figured it'd be a normal experience. That was when the floor manager came over to talk to my allergic friend in incredible detail about his allergy, double checked the order to ensure it was safe, told him that she'd made sure to instruct the kitchen to be careful with that order, and asked if he had any questions or concerns. She then personally brought his plate to him when it was ready (our server brought mine).

My friend has had this allergy his entire life and told me he's NEVER gotten that kind of extra mile service before. He was incredibly impressed by the service.

Also, the steaks were great. I had a caesar with mine, and it was great. As good as the food was (and it was very good), it was the service level that really stood out here.

The decor in this location is nice as well, with both indoor and outdoor seating available.",4
This is a go-to lunch spot for my friends and I to catch up during the week. Always great food with impeccable service.,4
"Great food without a doubt, but the experience is a little pricy.",3
"Great lunch!  Comfortable pleasant space, awesome service and good location",3
"As always, the steaks we're tender and flavourful",3
"Had a great dinner with an excellent waiter who surprised us with a nice dessert to celebrate our marathon.   What a nice thing to do.

Great, will return.....

Dan",4
"I took my husband here for a very special birthday based on reviews I had read online. We started our meal with escargot, probably the worst we have ever had. The herb flavor was so overpowering it was all you could taste.  For dinner we had the prime rib (which came highly recommended) and one of the sirloins. My sirloin was cooked to order but was so tough and grizzly I had to keep taking my napkin to remove pieces from my mouth that were not chewable.  I ordered a side of Bernaise sauce that was tasteless. My husband claimed the prime rib was probably the worst he had ever had. Our service was very good and it certainly was not our waitresses fault the quality of the meat was so poor. I couldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.",1
The service was extremely slow.  We waited more than an hour for our lunches to be served.  Two of the three steaks were not cooked to the correct doneness.  When the error was pointed out the manager stated that it was not possible to cook the cut medium rare.  This was an inaccurate statement as the guest ordered his steak this way every time he ate at the Keg.  In the end the Keg did correct the error but not before trying to pull a fast one on the customer.  Disappointing.,2
"solid, can't go wrong for a decent lunch. i'm there regularly.",2
The service was great. I was surprised that other servers helped clear the table when they saw we were finished with our meal. I haven't seen that in any of the restaurants that I have been to. It was nice to see.,3
Amazing service and great food,4
"I ordered 20 oz rib steak, medium rare, right to the point, meat not too much fat, tender & juicy, delicious, hot plate + beef juice is bonus.  I didn't order starter or dessert.",4
"ordered steak - was excellent, service was good, ambience relaxing",3
Nice!!! The food and the place are fantastic!! It was recommended by a friend of mine. I recommended for everyone whose visit this city. The meat and the potatoes was delicious!!! Try this restaurant in your next visit to Toronto,4
"Food was very good,  and the waitress was professional and helpful, however, the food was slow in coming out.",3
"I wanted to have a lovely meal before catching the Raptors game (apparently many others thought the same). Even though they were packed the service never wavered.   

I ordered my usual 32 oz rib steak with what seems to be 25 springs of asparagus  (not complaining).  My meal was cooked to order and the Reisling was crisp and light. 

Hands down the York St Keg is my fave.",4
"Cordial people, not too nosy, very good food. Been there many times and find it very consistent.",4
"The dinner was, as usual, great.  Service was friendly and properly paced.  Food was a good temperature and stayed the proper temperature throughout the meal.  We were seated in a quiet area where we could enjoy our meal with a moderate noise level and could see outside.  Altogether a very pleasurable experience!",3
The service was great! Perfect location if you are going to the National Ballet of Canada or to The Air Canada Centre. Staff is very attentive and considerate of showtimes. Very accommodating and professional!,4
the Keg has many selections for many tastes. Vibrant bar scene also.,3
"Met our daughter at The Keg on Friday night since we were staying at the Sheraton to attend a conference on Saturday. Good food, good wine, nice corner table, good conversation, night cap made a very enjoyable evening for all.",3
"The burger was really good, sweet potato fries were crisp, not overly salted, salad was really nice and they know when you ask for a tonic water and bar lime, you mean cordial so that was great to finally have it done right.
This was a 50th birthday lunch and it was very special.",4
"Really great. Steaks and twice-baked potatoes excellent. Service exemplary. I would have appreciated a slightly more ambitious dessert menu, but otherwise, flawless.",4
I was looking forward to a great meal at a great restaurant with my family. The Keg met my expectations and more. The food was great and the staff was exceptional. I was very surprised when the birthday cake showed up and forks for everyone so that I could share it with my family. Thanks!!,4
"My friend of 27 yrs and I went here last Friday for our combined birthday lunch and had a delicious meal and a wonderful time.  Look forward to doing this again in the future. 

Thanks!",4
"The restaurant itself is very nice, in fact likely the most 'posh' location they have.

As usual service was average and food was average. At $65pp all in, i expected more, but at the end of the day this is a chain restaurant churning out hundreds of steaks every night.",2
Went for dinner with my son.  Our server was fantastic and very attentive.  Food was delicious and presented nicely.  Would definitely return.,4
And got there and said we still had to wait 45 mins and decided we were not gonna wait when we had a reservation,0
"As parents of a young child, we don't get out much together. So we were looking forward to our meal out a lot! We were not disappointed. Our server was delightful. He was attentive and friendly, and didn't stop running around the whole time we were there. It's too bad one of the hostesses felt the need to be rude to him, yelling at him about clearing a table ""right now!"" That was not impressive in the least and unfortunately ended our evening on a less than perfect note. Otherwise, a great dinner out!",4
"Great service was provided, waiting time for food was average, steak was very good. A bit pricy but it is worth.",3
I greatly enjoyed my experience at The Keg. I have been there many times in the past but this was the first time my wife had been there. She thoroughly enjoyed it. We both enjoyed the food. We both ordered a 3 course meal from the Valentines Day special menu. The service was very fast and friendly. My server was named Drew and he was amazing. It was a particularly cold night that night and we definitely felt warm and cozy inside The Keg. The ambiance was perfect. Lighting good. Sound not too loud. The price is a bit high but fitting for the food quality. I would recommend The Keg for special occasions such as Valentines Day. Great overall experience.,4
Great and excellent service! Everything was excellent. Went for Valentine's with my wife and we will be back!,4
"The right amount of everything for a productive and pleasant business lunch for a party of four.  Not pretentious, not over the top, just the right formula of great service and respect for your time.",4
"Had a very enjoyable lunch with extremely quick, efficient and friendly wait staff.  Would definitely recommend this location to friends and co-workers.",4
"We had to rush a bit to make it to the Raptors game, so we only had a main course. The quality of the steaks and filet mignon was excellent. My wife who does not like meat, had three vegetables tacos and those were also great. The waitress was very nice and kind. So we had a great experience.",3
"-The service was quick and good.
-Manager was friendly
-scallops and bacon appy lacked flavour (no salt)
-side veg lacked flavour
-fries didn't seem freshly cut (McCain style)

Overall, the steak itself was amazing, the server and manager were efficient and kind.",2
Enjoyed my dinner there - food is good and service was good,3
"This location of The Keg is in the centre of the Financial District and a great place to meet colleagues and business associates.  Very popular and always reliable. 
Decent wine list and always something on the menu that appeals no matter your tastes.",3
"you know when you want something so familiar and comforting that you can taste it?  that's how I was feeling when I made the reservation and I was not disappointed.   my meal was exactly as I'd hope and our server was just the right amount of chatty - enough to make us feel welcome, but not so much as to feel like he should pull up a chair.",4
"Had an evening out with some friends from work. I chose the bar over the restaurant as I like the atmosphere better. This is why the noise level is higher... I don't believe it is quite the same in the restaurant area. 
Waiter was attentive, responsive,  and very helpful. She split the bill for us (group of 5) at the end saving a bunch of time for the group trying to sort things out. 
Overall, it was a fun night with no complaints.",3
The food was exceptional. The service was mediocre. Could improve the service by ensuring the entire table is cleared when done with items instead of select items.,2
My wife and daughter have gluten allergies and the staff took extra care that their needs were taken care of. Our server was very polite and available which made for a pleasant dinner for the entire family. Thank you.,4
"Good was only ok which was surprising for the Keg BUT the service was horrible! 
Never again",0
Great Keg location that lives up to the usual Keg standards.,3
"Overall the food was good, however disappointingly the proportions are getting smaller.",2
We visited the Keg during a brief stopover in Toronto and absolutely loved the place - so much so that we visited again a week or so later on another stopover. We visited with our young children both times and the service and friendliness of the staff was outstanding. Sabrina welcomed us with a great attitude to our kids and the whole experience was perfect from then onwards. Plus the steaks are excellent!!,4
"Waitress forgot a few things..bread and bbq sauce on the side, ambiance was hip modern and mellow. Great location.",3
Consistent food and service that you would expect from The Keg,3
"Our visit to the Keg was good overall. My only complaint would be that I requested a romantic table for our anniversary, and we were put in the back of the restaurant in the corner beside a large table of loud people. Our server was very attentive, and the food was good. I would return, but definitely request a better table.",3
"There were plenty of tables and booths available when we showed up. We were seated in the worst possible area, by the service door. I doubt I will use this service again. It made no sense to me to make a reservation and get seated in the worst area. We insisted to be moved.",2
We reserved a table for 4:30. We get there and there are lots of empty tables and they seat us at the table closest to the kitchen doors....we got a breeze when they went in and out of the kitchen,1
"Lots of great steak places in Toronto, I think the Keg's steak for cost cant be beaten.  Quality is as good as any high end place for a reasonable cost.  Everything else is pure gravy!",4
"This place is for meatlovers in contemporary surrounding. Danielle was an exceptional  server to a fussy group. This Keg provides options to control your caloric and fat intake yet have a delicious meal plus  online nutritional information! e.g. avoid the bacon, hollandaise sauce, salad dressing on side etc. Ask for asparagus, brussel sprouts  and mixed green salad (terrific) instead of  un-inspired side steamed vegetables and caesar. Of 4 different mains, only the hohum side steamed vegetables disappointed.
For me, the noise level was too much. We dined midweek thinking to avoid this but perhaps seasonal parties and gatherings were in full swing. There are at least 2 tables on north end of floor that are more secluded. Interior design favours hard surfaces hence noise levels. Still, the Keg Classic value meals take the pain out of  much higher pricing elsewhere for comparable cookery.",4
"Meal was excellent in Canada to see a Professional Basketball game with friends, steak was cooked to perfection. I would definitely go back.",3
"The service is excellent, the food is amazing, the atmosphere is beautiful and relaxing. We will definately go back",4
"Took my wife out to celebrate her Birthday at the Keg.  We enjoyed the service and the food was delicious.  Couldn't have been a better night thank you The Keg for your hospitality and great service. Keep up the great work guys. 

Tom Geo",4
"As per usual, The Keg delivered a reliable and very tasty sirloin steak prepared exactly as ordered. Sometimes with steakhouses I find the delivery inconsistent but this location, like most of The Kegs that I've visited, hit it spot on. The service was also good, attentive without crowding, with great follow-up.",3
The Keg has greatest selection of food and is all prepared to perfection. Is the best overall location for a romantic dinner anywhere in downtown Toronto. Top level service.,4
"We enjoyed the excellent Caesar salads. My Filet mignon was very tender. Vegetables cooked nicely al dente. The bottle of wine we bought, at $40, was good value. Great service.",3
"Elyse greeted us in the lounge before our dinner reservation. Recommended great drink
choices, provided excellent service as our party of four was celebrating birthdays and
graduation from college. By the time dinner rolled around we made our way to a waiting
table where Dave M served us, our apps, salads, steaks, wine, beer and a surprise dessert.

Kudos to the Keg and their staff.",4
Overall we very happy with our experience. The service was exceptionally good. I just enjoy restaurants that are less hectic and loud.,3
"Great food
Waiting to order took a while
Overall very nice dinner with friends",3
"Poor service, uninterested, and non polite. Frustating.",1
"We booked for a Sunday roast. We arrived and we‚Äôre told that no roasts were available due to them being quiet which is disappointing as that‚Äôs the reason we booked. We all ordered steak and I have never received such a badly cooked order. Mine was ordered medium rare and was medium. Other family members had a rare steak which was more cooked than the medium rare. Making a mistake for one is understandable. Making mistakes for all is unforgivable. At this price point, we paid a fortune for awful food. The chips were nice if that‚Äôs any consolation. The only saving grace was the servers. There was an English gentle man and a European lady and they were great. They didn‚Äôt check how we were getting on with our meals as this would have given us an opportunity to complain. There were about 5 other people in the restaurant so I‚Äôd hate to see them under pressure. We were given a discount as one of the servers saw the state of the meats which was appreciated. Regardless, will never go here again and we had to pay a premium for abjectly average food.",1
It was freezing inside. Sat by window in a group despite heaters off and a pretty empty restaurant,2
"The food and drinks were excellent, but the service was a bit lacking. I think the restraunt was a bit understaffed as it took quite a while between courses, for the waiter to appear for any assistance.",2
A great venue for a business lunch in Manchester close to Piccadilly station.  Food was excellent as was the service. Wine recommended by waiter was lovely and good value. Would recommend and will return when in the area,4
"Lovely meal for family get together of 8
Certainly would recommend & return",4
Finished up not paying the bill. The main course steaks took an hour and a half to arrive. They were supposed to be medium rare but came so burnt they were inedible. Great waiter who got the manager and after a brief exchange they decided not to charge.  Not the first time we have had issues here. We won't be going back.,0
"Really enjoyed the experience, the food was fantastic! Abit pricey, but you pay for what you get. Would definitely go again!",4
"Very good ,staff were atentive ,there was live music when we were there which added to the ambience",3
"Enjoyed a lovely afternoon tea for my friends 50th birthday treat. The staff had decorated our booth with banners and balloons and glasses of fizz which was a special touch. The food, teas and cocktails were great and the staff were very friendly and attentive. We had a fabulous time and would recommend the experience to everyone",3
"This was a celebration of our friends 65th birthday, it was apparent that the menu had changed and I was disappointed to find that my favourite main courses (2 of them) had disappeared from the menu. however I was far from disappointed when we all shared a huge Porterhouse steak which was cooked to perfection. I thought that the main course could have arrived with some form of potato dish, veg or a salad, but this was not to be and we had to order these from the side dishes on the menu.
All in all a good night and a near perfect celebration, thank you to Malmason.",3
"Service was very attentive nothing seemed to much trouble which makes a change these days.!! Sunday Lunch very good [beef was very tender] 
From start to finish we had a very enjoyable afternoon.
We will definitely be visiting again soon. Maybe we will try the brunch next time.",4
"I have been here previously and had a good experience so I wanted to celebrate the birth of my child with some friends at what I thought was a good restaurant. Unfortunately, it was not good on this occasion. The first negative was that we were given out of date menus so when we wanted to order, the food was not available for some people in the party; no apology was made for this.
Once we did order, the food took a very long time to arrive especially as we were there at lunch time and the place was empty. When  the food did arrive, it was clear that one of the steaks was smaller, overcooked, and generally of poorer quality than the others, so we sent it back. It took another 15 minutes for another steak to arrive and the staff did not offer to replace his (now cold) chips which were a ¬£5 side order! The waiting staff we had were generally inexperienced and pretty poor so made a catalogue of mistakes. Considering the price of the food and wine at this place, it was a completely disappointing experience.",0
Always a big fan of their steak. However we waited for nearly an hour before the food arrived this time. They offered us a free drink without us even asking so service was good.,3
"Have tried several Malmaison Sunday buffets over the years at other locations. This was consistent with those. However, whilst the service  was excellent, the food was ok. Roast was good quality but not very hot.",2
"The night in question, me and my partner had got engaged, I picked Smoak as it been my favourite restaurants for a number of years.

The food on the night was very salty and both me and my partner left more than we ate, we were asked on the night of the food was ok, not one to complain I didn't take this to the waiter but when ask was honest with my feedback.

To be fair to him he provided us with two drinks I was not charged for.

But thinking back i paid in excess of ¬£100 that evening and we ate on the way home.

This is first and only time I've not eatin all my food at Smoak, an would judge it as a one off, but it was my partners 2nd visit and I doubt I'll be convincing her with ease to join me again.

I really hope it was a one off and not a sign that Smoak is loosing it's edge on other restaurants in the city centre.

Thanks 


Mike",2
Food was poor.  Burnt burger bun and burger was raw.  Veg not cooked properly either. Very disappointed and would not recommend,1
4 courses for ¬£19.95 with unlimited starters for Sunday lunch is amazing value. One suggestion would be to ask guests whether they would like their gravy served separately. A beay=utifully pink roast beef was spoilt by being covered with gravy.,4
"Fast efficient and friendly staff...excellent wine, very good food...steaks very very tasty!",4
"The first waitress was not good,handed a menu then ran off. However she was replaced by a waiter who was excellent. Menu was good and the food was served well and was to a good standard. The restaurant is pleasantly laid out and has a good agreeable ambiance.",3
"A second visit, reasonable value overall. The waitress service was very good and friendly, the appetisers and steaks were consistently good following our fist visit. An enjoyable evening. The restaurant gave 15% discount on local parking for our guests.",1
"Service, atmosphere, food choices, drinks menu and staff all great. Attended a business informal dinner and was the perfect setting. Staff professional and friendly. Will definitely be recommending this restaurant and revisiting.",4
"Booked a table for two at the Smoak Bar and Grill for New Years Day and was pleasantly surprised.
I had the scallops to start with which were lovely and my partner the chicken lollipops which were succulent (a huge portion mind). For mains we had steaks (New York strip and a ribeye) both of which were full of flavour and well cooked",3
Menu was good and we enjoyed the starter however I wanted mash with my lamb chops and was served uncooked potato squares. When I complained the manager reacted immediately and insisted on preparing new meals as ordered which were excellent. He then through in some complimentary wine which made it even better.,3
We attended this restaurant early on Saturday evening in the first instance we noticed how dark the eating area was and most salient were the rowdy football fans watching the football on TV not an experience you want when you are eating your meal. Not too sure why it was so dark inside. The food was average a little to expensive for steaks.,2
"First of all... Excellent service... Knowledgeable waitress who couldn't do enough.
However the food for what you got was pricey.
For example. ¬£37 for a T-Bone that came on its own!
Extra for a 'cone' of fries and a mediocre offering for your chosen sauce. Which of course is extra.

Food quality is excellent..... Far too expensive though......",3
"Walked past here so many times on the way into town...what a mistake!
Food, service absolutely excellent. Serving staff helpful, knowledgeable  and very relaxed. Food was cooked perfectly. Quality excellent.
Really pleased we chose here for partners birthday celebrations",3
"Went there for lunch.The soup was very good,Personally,didn't really like the sauce.Still quit great.People there were very friendly.",3
"Its been a while since we ate at Smoak  but we had another enjoyable meal with friendly and attentive service throughout.
We had a drink at the bar area afterwards and will return there to sample one of their bar meals as it was very lively with a mix of people.",3
"From the gallery photos that I had sen on TriopAdvisor, I ahd something more refined in mind for what was supposed to be a romantic dinner for two to make up for not being able to do so for Valentine's Day.
On arrival, we were sat at a small table in the middle of the main throughfare and the overall feel was of an upgraded TGI Friday. When another table became available, the staff were happy to move us.
I had menu envy with my partner's choices; she chose shrimp tacos and a steak. Both of which she said were tasty and I confess that when I sampled her steak, it was very good.
My frito misto however was in a much heavier batter than I was expecting and greasier than I hoped for. My cod with mussels was ok.
As a weekend of indulgence, this was not the highlight. We went to a number of restaurants, some of which are trying for Michelin recognition and this was the most expensive and most disappointing.",2
"I've had many meals in various Malmaison restaurants and generally like the look and feel of the place. The food is of a high quality and overall I feel they are a cut above the mediocre rest. 
I liked the Smoak Bar for most of the reasons above. It had a good vibe. My steak was amazing and was quite reasonably priced. But somehow, the service here wasn't what I'd expect. We waited a long time for any kind of acknowledgement and longer to get the first drink. It was busy, yes, but not that busy, that it was a full 45 minutes before the first food arrived.
I wouldn't not go back but I hope it would be better the next time.",2
"Happy days after seeing Man City win, we walked from the ground to the venue to build up our appetite and arrived very hungry which was probably good news for the restaurant as overall we had a really good time. Starters Tuna tartare and Moules were both delicious. Followed by 2 steaks, Filet and T Bone both of very good quality and cooked exactly as ordered. All washed down with a reasonably priced Sauvignon. No room for pudding but staff were friendly and attentive and rushed off to provide the greens we forgot to order as we ate like savages. Very well done.",3
"nice experience, swanky restaurant! food was delish, but quite pricey comparing it to other steakhouses i have been to.",2
"We had a great dining experience which was made excellent by the service.

we were not rushed and the food was good. The atmosphere was good with the bar area particularly busy, the restaurant was not too busy and we felt at ease and relaxed. I think I was the only woman dining in the restaurant but I felt perfectly comfortable amongst the gentlemen.
I would go again and would recommend to a friend.",3
"Visited the Malmaison Smoak Bar & Grill on a Thursday evening (6pm). Service was really good, we were acknowledged at the door by a waitress immediately. The service was very prompt, and nothing was too much trouble. We had a treat and ordered two of the specials burgers. Both were amazing, and really interesting combinations. Would go back again for a romantic dinner - would recommend!",3
"The food was lovely, great prices, and really fresh, very impressed. had a great meal. delicious",4
"Visited on Saturday night, not enough serving staff on (forgot wine and water and had to ask twice). 
Ordered 250g and 350g new york strip and couldn't tell any difference (other than ¬£7) in them",1
"For a meal with a friend who was staying near Piccadilly, we tried Smoak as the steaks had been recommended. We first went to the bar area for a drink, where our credit card was confiscated so we could put the drinks on our restaurant bill. We felt very old. The hipster bar staff were mixing cocktails for the hipster clientele. Noise levels were distressing with loud music and people almost shouting to make themselves heard. It's called atmosphere, I guess. Meanwhile, middle aged Malmaison guests were walking through all this, which included 2 boisterous hen nights, to get to their rooms. Never mind, the draught pale ale was lovely. The food service was friendly and quick, the steaks were OK, the burgers were huge and the prices were high.",2
"Dined with my husband on Tuesday evening, food was delicious, service was excellent, cannot fault it!! Highly recommended...",4
This was a lovely meal in a very nice setting and not what I expected in a hotel..This restaurant had a lovely vibe and the staff were very attentive. The bar is very busy and worth a visit without even dining in the restaurant.They serve fantastic cocktails...even better when on offer until 8pm. I loved the open kitchen.Well worth another visit.,3
"We ordered the Chicken liver parfait, spiced pear chutney & warm toasted brioche for starters, there was no chutney just the pate and the warm brioche, with a small fig, we were extremely disappointed with the portion and the price.

We has to continously try and get the attention of someone to order drinks, which then took a very long time to come and after a second reminder they finally came.",1
One of the best stakes I have ever had. But it is a tad expensive,4
"Had a hankering for a nice juicy steak on my birthday and Smoak delivered perfectly! Service was personable, polite and never pushy. Food superb and wine excellent. Sure, not light on the pockets but some occasions warrant a bit of a spend. Highly recommended.",4
smoak bar and grill was an excellent venue for a pre-concert meal and is convenient for the apollo. eating at 6pm meant a relatively empty restaurant and therefore attentive service. the food quality was superb.,3
"Spacious, nice booths in. Good menu, although bear in mind that the Sunday lunch menu only lasts till 3! Which is a shame because it's a great place for a relaxed Sunday get together with friends for a late Sunday lunch!",3
"My friend and I have been here before, and the food, service and atmosphere are excellent. We were the last to leave, but there was no pressure at all.Recommneded1",4
Good as always but offered us a table near a draft so asked to move which was done promptly. We noticed others doing the same which is a shame as they were not full. Food was week presented and cooked. Service was good but the other waitress who has served us well in the past is much better. Good place to eat in Manchester with a vibrant atmosphere.,3
Good food and service and excellent value. Good ambience and we will return when next in Manchester,3
It was a vibrant and lively atmosphere and a good place to be on a saturday night. We had excellent service from our waitress Rosie. The food was excellent and well presented. The only issue was one of the starters should have come with a horseradish sauce and it didn't and when asked we were told the chef had got any horseradish so he left it off. We should have been told this when we ordered. Good selection of wines at reasonable prices.,3
"Thoroughly enjoyable meal for six of us, smooth service and probably the best steak I've had in Manchester",3
"Its been a while since we ate here so we were curious how it would be after many enjoyable meals in the past.
We shared ribs from the specials board to start but they were just ok. My steak & frites was a big improvement and the fact it was too much for me worked out well as my partners small sea bass meal went nowhere close to filling him.
The restaurant was very busy that evening and it showed as we waited some time between courses and getting the bill took forever. Not as good as we remembered but will return if any good offers are put on.",2
The food was delicious with a wide choice to fit different tastes. House wine was also good. Service was extremely slow and some servers were not pleasant to speak with.,2
Great night again! 50% off in January made it outstanding value. Amazing meat selection. Top service.,3
"Great evening celebrating with a friend. The burger from the specials board was immense. Beef, peanut butter, cheese and bacon. Yum! We used the January 50% off food voucher from www.mdog.me so it was amazing value. Been here a few times, this was the best evening there ever. Good service and (for the first time) a brilliant atmosphere. Will definitely be going again next week, before the offer ends.",4
"Friendly service, excellent food, lighting rather too dim, music far too loud - however, was turned down a tad on request. A great evening experience for my husband's 60th birthday (even if we were older than the intended guest age)!",3
We had a great time thanks. Mother and Grandma were suitably impressed. :),3
"I really enjoyed the meal at the restaurant, all the food our party ordered was very tasty and excellent value!, I recommend the Lamb Trio off the specials board if your going soon!

Drinks service was a little slow, took over ten minutes to get a drinks order and then a furth 10/15 mins to get said drinks, we were asked for our main order and shown a load of raw steaks before the drinks order was taken and served it also remain slow for the rest of the meal. Add also that errors were made with our bill on drinks (3 extra bottles of wine), this was quickly rectified and deducted to represent the true bill! That said i do feel its an area the restaurant needs to improve on!",3
"A large restaurant attached to the Malmaison hotel, - atmospheric with steaks and carcasses on display. Generally excellent food. Large menu with daily specials.",2
"Went to Smoak Bar and Grill for a special treat on my birthday. The cocktail bar is great, spacious, proper chairs at the bar (nice touch), excellent choice of cocktails quickly served. The food was competent but not special and the veggie dishes were poor - I know it's a meat restaurant but you still need to have a couple of high quality veggie options available. The service was quick and friendly. So not a bad evening but didn't quite live up to the promise.",1
"Six of us went out for dinner. Had never been before, but heard good things. My friends were new to Manchester from abroad and also visiting from London.

It was the worst service and meal we had ever experienced. Waited 2 hours for cold tasteless food!

I will never go back there!",0
"We had lunch at Galvin at Windows, this was our 2nd visit and once more the food was delicious, service excellent and we had a relaxed time with great ambiance.",3
"nice and friendly service.
stunning view and amazing food!
Overall such a wonderful dinner!",4
"A truly top restaurant, and not just because it is on the 28th floor. Michelin star quality degustation with wine just right in variety and quantities. Great service from friendly and knowledgeable somelier and waiters. Views have to be seen to be believed.",4
"Fantastic food, great wine recommendation.",3
We visited Galvin at Windows in London for a birthday treat.  The food was delicious and the service very attentive making for a very special meal.,4
excellent food and service as always.,4
"The set Spring lunch menu was good value 3 courses and a glass of champagne for ¬£29.  The haddock & mussels starter was especially good.  Mains of pork belly was substantial, if a little overpowered by the lentils.  Service was outstanding.  The merlot at ¬£4.50 a glass was very good value.  Note that the bar is closed for refurb and you need to take the lift to the lobby to use the bathrooms.",3
"Galvins at windows is a nice venue and represents decent value with their offer of 3 courses from a set menu at ¬£29 including a glass of champagne. However, the same thing from the full menu was ¬£65, which although I have not tried it, has to be overpriced!

House wine at ¬£5 per glass is also good value. However, ¬£5 for a side order of spinach which was about the size of a heaped tablespoon is a complete rip off, so I think they need to take a look at their pricing structure!",3
"Galvin @ Windows, Mayfair.

Must be one of the best restaurant views in London.  Despite not being on the balcony, we still had a view over Hyde Park.  The service was absolutely impeccable.  Food excellent and beautifully presented.  We had the prestige menu as the main courses on the lunchtime menu were not to our taste.  At ¬£65, quite expensive compared with the ¬£29 for the alternative.",4
Great venue with lovely views.  The bar was being refurbished but you would never know as they had put up a false wall to hide the work.  Overall a lovely meal with great variety.,3
A great value deal at Galvin at Windows.,3
"Galvin at Windows (London) was brilliant, great food, great staff, amazing views! Will definitely be visiting again.",4
"Meal was excellent and great value, however, water and extra sides were very costly.  Otherwise, was a great experience in a fantastic venue.  Would go again.",4
"My wife and I had a fabulous lunch for our wedding anniversary at Galvin at Windows. This is the second time that we have been there and everything is first class, the food, the service, the atmosphere and of course the views.
Phi and Jenny Myhill April 2012",4
"Windows on the World - Hilton - Park Lane - London.  Had a very nice lunch - beautiful view, although it was pouring with rain that day.  It was unfortunate that the 
toilets were being renovated and to use a toilet you had to go down 27 floors which was not the most convenient arrangement.  Overall a good experience and not too expensive.",3
"An amazing experience in what must be one of London's top eateries in my humble opinion!

The view - Worth the cost alone...

Really enjoyed the frogs legs starter in what can only be described as the best ""green pond"" I have ever had the joy to eat.
Followed swiftly by excellent service from our many waiters arrived my pink, perfect and beautiful lamb main. Cooked three ways and each as delictable as the other.

8/10 and I will see you again soon, hungry for more.",4
"Excellent unobtrusive service staff were very friendly.
Food was very good particularly the brill. Lamb wasdelicious, perfectly cooked and well seasoned, but unsure what the mini shepherds pie added. Wild strawberry desert was superb. Amous Bouche was i suspect an aquired taste!
Didn't get a window seat but the impressive views were still a treat. Would happily return!",4
"Fantastic location, food and service.  Have considered eating at Galvin at Windows in London for some time, but the 'Springtime' offer finally convinced me to book.  The lunch was for a special occasion (my partner's birthday) and the experience was all we could have wished for.  We will definitely be eating here again.",4
"Good food and service, but still expensive even with the offer. Happy to go again, but would prefer not to be paying.

Three of us ate from the prestige menu. ¬£65, but with two bottles of average priced wine, some water and some side dishes and service the bill was about ¬£330.",3
"The food, except for my husband's main course, was superb. He chose quail, something we frequently cook at home. We've never had such a small bird & it was slightly under-cooked. Complaining gently about this produced no reaction. The portions, especially of the starters, are tiny & we are not big eaters. Another complaint: coffee was served in cups - fine - we were offered refills - good - when the bill came we were charged for each cup. In a fine dining restaurant, this is bad form",3
"No problems with Menu du Chef (see previous review, possibly a misunderstanding).  Restaurant packed midweek. Requested a quiet table, perhaps pushing it on a discounted meal, but not given one.  Food - good.  Wine list expensive, so ended up quite a pricey evening.  Service over-attentive initially, subsequently hard to attract attention - surprising in a high quality restaurant. Chef unhappy quail was overcooked, so unprompted,  due to possible delay, served us an extra (delicious) fish course",3
Had yet another superm meal at Galvin at Windows. As usual I found the staff attentive and friendly. Highly recommended and will be back when I'm next in London,4
The food was ver good but not a great selection of vegetarian food. As excited the view was amazing,4
Wonderful meal and service. Will return in the very near future.,4
"Had lunch at Galvin at Windows, Park Lane, London.
The efficiency and helpfulness of the staff was first class.
We had a super view over London even though our table was set slightly back from the window, and also there was plenty of opportunity for more viewing from the bar windows.
The food was imaginative and delicious, and truffles and marshmallows were brought  on at the end.
A very enjoyable experience in every way.
Booking was quick and trouble-free.",4
"Galvin at Windows in Mayfair.  Excellent food and great service.  Offered table by window with view when one became free without having to ask, which was a nice touch. The 3 courses for ¬£39 was good value. Good atmosphere even though we arrived fairly late. Highly recommended.",4
An excellent and memorable experience - wonderful food and service.  Lovely views and atmosphere.,4
"Excellent food and excellent service.
Our table was moved to enjoy the view of London whilst we had lunch which made the meal more special
Highly recommended...",4
"Galvin at Windows.
Fantastic setting, superb friendly, helpful service and sublime food. All of our chosen three courses complimented each other and were of a high standard, beautifully presented and received with appreciation by each diner. From my smoked salmon, Cornish crab and advocado puree starter through to the coffee, truffles and marshmellow selection finale, it was superb.The additional little touches made this the ideal restaurant to celebrate our landmark birthday.",4
"Had a great time. Fantastic deal (3 course ¬£29 with champagne). Service was good, location perfect. Would go again.",4
"This was my second time at Galvin at Windows at Park Hilton Hotel, London and it was just as good the second time around. The restaurant is lovely, the view is terrific, the food delicious and service efficient.",4
"This offer is really worthwhile. The food was excellent and the service was spotless. I was there on a sunny day and the view was great, too! I even got a chef's complimentary starter on the day of visit.",4
"We visited Galvin at Windows in London for lunch.  From the moment we arrived the service was second to none.  Absolutely flawless.  The food and wine was very good, the ambience enjoyable and the views amazing.  Highly recommended.",4
"Our lunch was a fantastic all round experience. Service was superb, the view and ambience was great and the food was outstanding. The food was great value at ¬£29 per head for 3 courses, plus a glass of champagne. Only let down is the price of the drinks. But this can be said for a lot of great restuarants.",4
"We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch at Galvin at Windows, seated at a window table so had a lovely view. We had the ¬£65 Prestige menu & the starter & deserts were gorgeous but I was disappointed to have to pay extra for veg to go with my main course, already at a ¬£5 supplement! The offer included a glass of champagne & a coffee but we were charged for the coffee which my husband didnt notice. The 2hr turnaround on the table was ignored & we enjoyed a unhurried 3hrs.",4
"GALVIN at WINDOWS in London was very welcoming from the moment we stepped into the restaurant we were very well looked after.

We had the set menu - which although the portions were very small - the food was delicious..

Could have done without the marshmallows after coffee though!",3
"Galvin at Windows at the London Hilton on Park Lane.
Sun shining, amazing view, excellent food and all for ¬£29.  Great value for money",4
"I went with my wife for a dinner on Friday evening using the top table 'Menu du chef' offer.
For a fine dining restaurant the food and experience was good, but we've had better. It was lively and the setting (the views of London) were a big plus though, so perhaps worth going to for that, but not enough to make us regulars. Given the offer we felt the meal was value for money. Staff were friendly and engaging",3
"Very good meal, reasonable value, excellent setting. Service was very stong",4
Galvin @ Windows. Was great.,3
"Very pleased with the service, food and venue (Galvin in London Hilton).",4
"Great view and service, food good, not bad value for lunch.  Do a late lunch and see the sunset well worth it!",4
"We had three hours there and loved every minute.Felt very relaxed, will be going back",4
"Our visit to Galvin at windows was well worth the visit. We opted for the 3-course meal with a glass of champagne. The service was excellent and the views magnificent, so it's well worth requesting a window table if you can. The meal on the whole was pretty good although the choice was a little limited, but the pannacotta was to die for!",3
Galvin at Windows gave us a fantastic experience for a special birthday meal- a wonderful sparkly view from the 28th floor windows; attentive and yet not fussy service and superb food even from the restricted menu attached to outgreat value for money offer. And having attended to the details of the birthday boy they brought a birthday plate inscribed in chocolate sauce with a special little cake - what a lovely thoughtful surprise. All in all we had an unforgettable evening. Thank you.,4
"We visited Galvin at Windows on a Tuesday evening.  We had a cocktail in the bar first .  We followed on with the 3 course set meal which was splendid.  A stunning location, first rate service and superb food.  At the end, they bought marshmallows, strawberry and lime which were the best ever.  

I would defintely recommend visiting. I visited with my son but it would be very romantic venue for a couple.",4
"we ate at galvin at windows in london for lunch, good value for money, friendly team however service was a little irregular but imagine they were tired from a busy christmas and new year, overall a pleasant experience, would go again.",3
It was unfortunate that the view for which Galvin at Windows is famous was ruined by the awful weather but the food and service were also a little disappointing. The food was good but not memorable and the staff were rather aloof and overly formal.,2
"We visited Galvin at Windows on the 30th December, for a three course lunch and were immediately impressed with the efficiency of the staff on our arrival. We  enjoyed our meals which were presented beautifully and served by extremely attentive and friendly staff. The views over London were magnificent, we were served our coffee in the bar area, which was comfortable and unhurried with, once again, spectacular views over the city. A complete dining experience which was also very good value.",4
We had a fabulous lunch at Galvin at Windows - great food in a great venue.,4
"Absolutely Loved it! Great food, service and.. the views!",4
This is my second time here and food is as delicious as always. Service is the BEST u can ever get. High recommend and will definitely bring more friends :),4
"My third visit to Galvin's - not nearly as good as previously. Discovered had to book a table in the bar for a drink before lunch and, despite there being free tables, we were not allowed a table with a view - one of the main draws of this restaurant. Choice very limited for set lunch deal and cost of wine and other drinks meant overall bill ¬£170+ for two people- NOT good value. Also we were urged to vacate our table after 90mins - not two hours as indicated in the terms of the meal deal.",3
"Galvin at Windows is a beautiful restaurant. Tables were nicely spaced and large enough to hold all that we ordered (not always the case!), chairs very comfortable. We splashed out on the ¬£65 menu, and found it so well-balanced that we were able to eat three courses without feeling over-full. The food was superb and innovative. Service was excellent and friendly. We had a half-bottle of Sancerre and my cousin had a glass of dessert wine. Not cheap but they have a really good set lunch deal.",4
"We had a really lovely meal at Galvin, London, can not fault it.  The food was excellent, we ate from the special lunch time menu, 3 courses for ¬£29 and chose to upgrade to the ¬£45 option, which included half a bottle of wine each.  The service was brilliant, they couldn‚Äôt do enough for the table and even provided an additional ‚Äòcake‚Äô desert as it was my birthday.  The restaurant is beautiful and the views breathtaking, especially at Christmas with all the festive lights. Would highly recommend!",4
Excellent in every way !!!,4
"Had lovely set lunch at Galvin at Windows, London., but was a little disappointed with choice of dessert. Staff are very attentive without being overabearing and moved us to a window seat for dessert and coffee. Great views.",3
A truly excellent deal in a excellent resturant.  we enjoyed the food and every minute of the experience,4
"Smoak Bar & Grill, Malmaison, Manchester - A pleasant time was had. The 2 (or 3) course xmassy type menu with half a bottle of wine per person was reasonable at ¬£20 per person. This place still irritates me a though. The theming / advertising / whole idea suggest something it's actually not. There's no drama in the glum kitchen. Definitely give it a go by all means but if you ever went to the previous brasserie, which did need updating, then you may also find this place a tad irritating too.",3
"Galvins@Windows, London - what an amazing experience. One of the best meals I have ever had!!
Service was faultless, ambience perfect, views breathtaking at even at night. Had a truly memorable dining experience with my family.",4
"We had a fabulous dinner at Galvin at Windows.  The atmosphere in the bar was electric, the food and wine excellent.  The only blip being that we had booked a 3 course special offer dinner but we were not offered this particular menu to choose from.  The waiting staff were a bit sniffy when we mentioned this offer but the offer menu did arrive eventually.  As it happens, we all decided that the normal menu was too tempting and ordered from this instead!   So pleased we did!  We will be back!",4
"Galvin at Windows, 22 Park Lane, London, W1K 1BE

Great views and excellent service.  We went for the 3 course meal for ¬£65.00.  For starters I had the duck pastilla which was very tasty.  For the main I had the seabass iwth octopus, this was slightly disappointing as the seabass was overcooked and the beans made the meal feel very heavy.  We had the pair tart for dessert which was very tasty.",3
"Had six people for set lunch at Galvin at Windows and decided to take option of three courses, half bottle of wine per head, water and coffee for ¬£45 per person.
Food was excellent, wine choice although limited with set menu was very good and general ambience and service superb. Would recommend.",4
"Smoak Bar & Grill, Piccadilly, Manchester

Another very tasty meal using the 2 courses plus coffee & wine for ¬£30 per couple offer. This is such good value for dinner in a buzzing restaurant with great staff who are friendly and efficient. Mary Portas off the BBC was there the night we were so i hope she enjoyed it as much as us! Highly recommended.",4
A very successful visit to Galvin at Windows located on the 28th floor of the London Hilton. The staff were excellent and helped make it a memorable experience.  Although the set menu was limited the food was of the highest standard. A visit is highly recommended,4
Delicious food and excellent service. Highly recommended.,3
Really like this restaurant - great ambience and the food has been consistently good. Cocktails are also worthwhile trying!!,3
"Went to Galvin for my birthday. It was very good, will definitely go back again.",4
"absolutely superb. the staff were attentive, helpful and friendly. the food excellent, the wine good value and they even offered a birthday cake at the end. Views of course stunning.",4
This was an astounding lunch for my partner's birthday.  The whole experience was magical from start to finish.  It was astounding and will certainly visit again in the future.,4
"Not too sure how he got a mchelin star?  Service and presentation were great, but actual taste of the food let it down.  It was better than the average restaurant, but Galvin at Windows in London was a bit of a let down.   The view made up for the food though, but the prices were also very steep for the lack of flavour.  The cheaper lunch menu was extremely limmited so i went for the 65 pound 3 course lunch which looked better on the menu card than it tasted. View was the best bit unfortunately",2
"Galvin at Windows - Hilton Hotel - Park Lane, London

Took my girlfriend for her birthday, wanted the wow factor and certainly got it! The venue itself is stunning, even with fog the views are amazing - the bar next door helped to relax the atmosphere of the venue and felt very, very comfortable. Staff were fantastic and tentative without being overbearing and as for the food- simply amazing!I guess the only downside is that its not cheap but then these places aren't, so as a treat -  perfect!",4
"Galvin at Windows at London Hilton is a luxury hotel restaurant with good (but  pricey) food. The location offers a fantastic view of London but the room is big and loud(with rock music coming from the adjacent bar) and not really intimate. The food (in very small portions) is good but really nothing special (one of the mains was absolutely tasteless). Even with the 39-pound menu one ends up paying around 70 per person anyway (with a glass of wine, water and service): not really value for money.",3
"Smoak Bar & Grill, Piccadilly, Manchester

We had another very enjoyable dinner using the 2 courses,wine and coffee offer. I adore the cheess sticks starter  and both the salmon and chicken mains are to be recommended. Service, as usual, was very good and we appreciated  the addition of some M&M's with our coffee!",4
The food was amazing. Service was excellent along with the stunning views of London. A superb meal.,4
Smoak Bar & Grill - Manchester - uber smart venue,4
"We had a fantastic meal at Galvin at Windows (Park Lane Hilton, london.)  We enjoyed a lovely cocktail in the restuarant bar on the 28th floor with stunning views over Hyde Park.  The waiters were extremely attentive and kept bringing lovely nuts for us to enjoy (free of charge) prior to us sitting down for our lunch.  The food was brilliant, we had mackerel to start followed by pork cheek on a bed of lentils.  Pudding was delicious followed by petit four and coffee. Absolutely brilliant!",4
Set lunch menu very good and good value.  Very professional service and overall really enjoyed the whole experience.,3
good food and great service - very attentive,4
"Galvin at windows at the London Hilton, Fantastic food, great service and one of the best view points in London. Will definitely return here!",4

We had another very enjoyable dinner on the value for money ¬£30 for 2 deal. Highly recommended.",4
"Galvin at windows is superb!! The service was just impeccable and the food amazing! We had the ¬£39 'dinner deal' and it was divine!The staff was more than willing to help me with the menu and had a very good knowledge of ingredients etc. This place is really special.The  attention to detail, ambience, staff and food are exceptional! I don't tend to return to restaurants as I enjoy trying different places but this is worthy of many visits and im hoping my hubby books it for my upcoming birthday!!",4
"Lovely setting with good service. The food was excellent and good value considering the quality of the food and location. Great marshmallows, and wine was exxellent.",3
went to  Galvin at windows last night. everything  is so great! cant ask for more!!,4

"Smoak Bar & Grill ,Piccadilly, Manchester.

It was a good thing we had booked as even on a wet Monday night, the place was bursting with people!
We had the 'double daring acts' offer so ate from a limited choice menu but the crab & avocado salad plus the deep-fried cheese sticks were so tasty as were the lovely salmon and chicken/ cheese mains . Coffee and wine completed a  good deal. The service was very efficient and friendly in spite of it being really busy so we're returning next week !",4
"Good food and attentive service. Good value for the set menu, but full ""a la carte"" quite overpriced. Nice view fron the 28th floor of this Hilton Park Lane restaurant.",4

"Galvin at Windows - London Hilton - Hyde Park corner.What a fantastic venue to celebrate our son's 18th birthday.Excellent service, fantastic food and views on a lovely sunny October day were tremendous.3 course lunch at ¬£29 was excellent value.Highly recommended",4
Yum!  Pricey but worth splashing out.  Food looked and tasted gorgeous. Staff worked like a finely oiled machine.  Am definitely saving up to go back...,3
"Great food, great service. Recommend the ¬£39 menu",4
"I treated my friend to the incredibly reasonable set lunch at Galvin at Windows.  The food was delicious:humble ingredients like mackerel and pork belly were cooked superbly. I didn't think it was possible to rave about sweetcorn soup but it was so fresh and sweet that I did. Smiling staff gave impeccable service and we felt thoroughly spoiled. The views are special too.  I thought this was a restaurant I would try just once, but they have me hooked - I will definitely return.",4
"Go to any other Galvin restaurant, not Galvin at Windows. Sensational food - ruined by some of the service. We were refused a table with view even though there were free ones. We were refused bar seats with views after the meal, even though bar area was mostly empty. We almost left because of hard time we were given about our bags (we had to offer that they were searched!) We felt totally unwelcome and cut our evening celebration short. It's a blokes with bulging wallets place.",2
Toptable lunch offer at 'Galvin at Windows' (unusual name) in the Hilton Park Lane London was very good value.  After reminding them of our request to sit by the window the restaurant was able to find us table with excellent views inc. the gardens of Buckingham Palace.  For each course there were 3 dishes from which to choose and we thoroughly enjoyed the food and service.  Would go again with TT offer.,4
"Food is simply stunning, rich of flavor and every dish is one of a kind. The salmon starter is a fantastic pick if you like fish and carpaccio like dishes. The lamb as a main dish is an absolute piece of art, which also applies to the artichoke and shepherd's pie.",4
"Fantastic food and service, good value offer.",4
"Galvin at Windows was fantastic. Fantastic food, service and atmosphere/location.",4
"I've heard about this restaurant from friends who gave it glowing reviews so decided to try the two courses for ¬£30 for two people offer. The menu for the offer was limited, but the food was excellent. I had the lamb cutlet with new potatoes, whilst my friend had the seafood with creamy mash. Both were delicious and filling. The creme brulee had the perfect texture and consistency and the Charlotte Royal was tart and creamy - absolutely delish! Highly recommended.",4
"Wonderful restaurant and very good service.We arrived early and had a drink at the bar as our table was booked for 9.45pm but when we returned to have dinner our table was given away.I felt a little disappointed as we could've been seated at 9.15pm but chose to come after a drink.We then had to wait without being informed  when our table would be ready,so after 15mins we went back and again our table was given away.The lady finally gave us a window table!Should keep table if guests have arrived",3
"great service all around , one of the people we went with had special food requirements and they didnt mind and actually helped her choose other things an went out of their way to do this. Excellent !!  very happy with everything.",4
"We booked a table at Galvin's for Friday evening.  From the time we arrived until the time we left the service we received was impeccable. Staff were always around to assist but not overly pushy and were discreet.  There is only one word to describe the food ""exquisite"".  Every course was not only well presented but tasted divine as well. The view from the restaurant is first class as it is 360 degrees.  Truely a marvellous experience and one I would love to repeat one day.",4
"This is a lovely restaurant with stunning views over Hyde Park. On the night we went (a Thursday) the restaurant was full, with a lively atmosphere.

Service was exemplary - friendly, efficient but not obtrusive.

Food was excellent and beautifully presented, the offer menu was fairly short, but had an adequate choice.

Even with the offer price of ¬£39 for three courses,  with two bottles of water, and half a bottle of wine each from the extensive wine list, the bill was ¬£230.",3
"this time I take four guests to Galvin at Windows in Park Lane, food is good and one of my guest choosing the three courses manu , portion is okay  and good value to go there. will take friends go back again.",3
Galvin at Windows in London Park Lane was a terrific setting for a fabulous 10th Wedding Anniversary.  Excellent service. Fine wine was shared along with great food.  My wife is still talking about her exquisite souflee for dessert.  Oh and the views...  Highly recommended.,4
"Food was was very good (I had the menu degustation) and the staff were attentive.  However, they were a bit stingy with the wine servings per course, each glass was a couple of mouthfuls.  Decor is a bit dated and food was pricey, but then I guess you expect that eating in such a superb vantage point.",3
A friend and myself went to Galvin at Windows last Friday for lunch and had a fabulous time. Service was attentive and subtle (i.e. you didn't notice them filling up the wine glass) and the food was amazing. Only drawback was we weren't placed by the windows as it was a stunning view. Would def go again.,4
"Beautiful place! Very Romantic, will definitely go again.",4
"This was my second visit to Galvin at Windows,London, and I can't wait for the third! Everything about it is superb.",4
"we were welcomed and felt they were ready and expecting us. Everybody was professional, helpful and friendly. Food was good, we enjoyed more the entrees. Overall a special occasion that felt special.",3
Malmaison was back to its best tonight thankfully. Still super busy but a lovely friendly welcome. Bit of confusion from our sever on the 3 Tenners offer but all sorted in the end. Ordered smoked salmon to start. Fresh and delicious. Followed by the lamb which was cooked perfectly with a beautiful sauce. Never wanted it to end. Red wine was smooth and tasty. All in all a great value offer and Mal is getting back to its best! Made up and would recommend.,3
"We opted for the Summer of Champagne deal which included food from the Prestige menu. All the food was pleasing and beautifully presented. We were served complimentary soft breads and Amuse Bouche at the beginning and chocolate truffles with marshmallows after our desserts.
The atmosphere was very welcoming, not at all pretentious, and the service was very good and one of the highlights.",4
"We went for lunch at Galvin at Windows as a treat for my daughter. We had a table by a window with a fabulous view. The weather was dreary  but the welcome from the staff was warm and friendly . We chose the package of 3 courses, half a bottle of wine plus coffee for ¬£45. It was nice to be able to choose rose wine and not just white or red.
The starter of wood pigeon was tasty . Main course was duck and sausage roll, strange pairing but enjoyed it. Eton mess for dessert was gorgeous.",4
"We visited Galvin at Windows for lunch and thoroughly enjoyed every moment. The food, wine and service were really good. We selected from the 'menu du jour' and each course was delicious, particularly the gazpacho soup. At first we were seated away from the window but quite quickly a window table became available and the staff kindly offered to move us there. We also felt it was good value for money. So all in all a great experience and one that I would highly recommend.",4
"We went to Galvin at windows on Park Lane, London for a 3 course ¬£29 lunch menu offering a great value opportunity to glimpse the food you would eat if money was no object. Luxurious service, stunning views from the 28th floor of the Hilton and food which lived up to the glamorous setting. I did not appreciate paying ¬£4.95 for a cup of tea however!",3
Lovely food- interesting amd cooked well.  We ordered from the  set menu was very good and wonderful value.   The venue has wonderful vues over London. My one criticism is the speed of service. We were rushed through 3 courses in under 1.5hrs. Not what you expect from a resturant of this standard and also far too fast for the food you are eating.,2
"SMOAK in Manchester on a wet Thursday evening: full and buzzing. But the meal was patchy. Caesar salads ok apart from  rock hard ""croutons"". Good steak but separate price for any sides makes it pricey! Vegetables at least are not overcooked. Burger had no mention of tomato to which friend is allergic - but promptly  replaced. The wine list is well chosen, with good variety, but some silly markups especially at the top end. Service is prompt, friendly and knowedgeable. A rather mixed experience!",2
"It was a lovely experience, eating in this beautiful restaurant, but we unfortunately chose the wrong day to go. It poured with rain during our lunch, and even though we were moved to a table near the window, our views did not extend much further than the park opposite!
The staff were lovely, and very attentive, picking up on the fact that we were there to celebrate our anniversary, and presented us with a complimentary dessert which was a nice touch. The food was very nice but not exceptional.",3
"Food was creative but not amazing.  Service was exceptional, as was the view!  Reasonable when on the 39gbp for 3 courses menu.  Othewise, could get a bit pricey, esp. as although there are some v. reasonably priced wines the cocktails and beers are pricey.",3
"7pm Friday 3-course for ¬£39 at Galvin, London. We requested a window seat because it was our anniversary. We didn't get one but we did get some petits fours, so that was nice. The staff were friendly and food good. The mullet starter excellent, the cod & duck mains had 'one two many ingredients' for us, puds: eton fantastic, peach a bit sour. They left out meat bits on fish plates as requested: very good thanks. Atmo picked up at 8pm.",4
"Food is good,and good value , will go back again to Galvin at Windows, will take my friends go again.",3
"Smoak Bar & Grill, Manchester: Good bye Malmaison Brasserie, hello Smoak Bar & Grill, their new concept. We're glad it's just a concept. The offer is great but the food was just nice. Their new theme is 'too themey' with the menu not really tying in with in. American style grill, with no real grill influence. Italian starter, French main, American style dessert, what's going on? Full of busy fools, served by 7 people, repeating orders over and over again, manager's attitude shocking! Get a grip!",2
"What can I say? The whole experience was a pure delight. Galvin at Windows London. Has to be visited,",4
excellent meal and ambiance-good value  Gillian Stanley Sheffield S103LF,4
"we took a table for 4 at galvin at windows on the ¬£39 deal. sat in the bar for drinks beforehand, lovely views over south / west london. bar staff attentive and friendly. the three course dinner, although limited to 3 options per course, was very good indeed. carefully prepared, very good quality fish and meat. portion sizes on the small side, but to be fair noone felt hungry afterwards. the service was great, very friendly waiter and sommelier. cost per head ¬£75, including 3 bottles of wine.",4
"Took my mother for her birthday and had a superb meal. The service was exquisite, even finding us a window table at short notice. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, whose service was to be commended.

As this wasn't my first visit, I knew to expect excellent quality food, and would recommend the lamb - cooked to perfection. The tarte tatin also comes highly recommended, but for 2 to share? More like 4!

Lovely evening - will be back again soon.",4
"Galvin at Windows, London

Our booking was the first sitting of sunday lunch. After being introduced to our waiter at the table we ordered the food straight off from a limited offer menu. 

Brief photo session later we seated to the repeated courses of finely thought out plates, immaculately delivered. My gazpacho was refreshing. The cod in my main stayed together just until my fork touched it. My Eton mess was the perfect sendoff.

The attentive and polite staff were the cherry on top!",4
"The 3 course deal at Galvin at Windows is fantastic value for money as the quality of the food is outstanding, the service is impeccable and, of course, the views are spectacular.  This was my second visit ot Galvin's and it was just as good at the first.  Our only criticism was that my colleague asked for a bottle of Sancerre and, without checking, the wine waiter brought the more expensive one, which we thought was a bit cheeky as we didn't realise until the bill came.",4
"It is a nice view and food was lovely, it is worth for money,",3
"We wanted a special venue for our son's graduation lunch and I don't think we could have done better.  
The set lunch menu combined an excellent 3 course meal with wine for a very reasonable price, with a view across London to die for.  
The wine suggested by the sommelier was excellent and complemented the meals well.
Will definitely visit again, as often as possible.",4
"The restaurant itself was fantastic. The staff where very helpful and the food and drinks where amazing.
However the hotel itself was a real disappointment.
The reception of building was full of young children running riot, and adults just standing around.
We had to wait 15 min for the lift to the 28th floor, the staff saying that the kids where playing in the lifts. It was very strange that such a fantastic location and a company that prides itself on quality allow this to happen.",3
"I booked this restaurant as part of a birthday treat for my husband. the service was truly fantastic, I have never experienced anything like it and i've been to a number of restaurants. The staff were lovely and surprised us with brithday chocs for my husband at the end of the meal which was a lovely touch. The food was excellent, we both enjoyed our meal, i had a slight issue with my dessert being slightly sour but i suspect that was my tastebuds rather than the dish.",4
Gavin at windows in the London Hilton was fantastic. This was a birthday treat and the staff made us and me especially feel very special. The food was gorgeous and it's taste was amazing.   The chocolate birthday treat was a lovely surprise and very much enjoyed,4
"Galvin at Windows London. Truly excellent as always. Great food, service  ,decor and views.",4
"An exellent lunch @Galvin at Windows in Park Lane, London.  It was a special venue for a special occasion.",4
"This was a very memorable evening, not quite what I expected at first but that was probably because Trader Vicks was closed and the Windows bar was quite busy, but the food was excellant and the service was excellant. Despite having booked for the early session we were under no pressure to move. It was my wife's birthday and although they were not told in advance  they picked it up and made a bit of a show which made her evening.",4
"Galvin at Windows, I had the specail 3 course meal at ¬£39 which was okay, the choices were not great and my partner opted for the al carte menu and had  steak which we were told was ¬£35 for the one course. But when the bill came they added another ¬£5 when he didn't have the 3 course meal!  So the steak in fact cost ¬£40! Unfortunately, it only came to my attention after we had left the restaurant. The scenery was beautiful from where we sat, but its not enough to entice us back!",2
"Another highly enjoyable, delightful and delicious meal at Galvin at Windows, London. Despite having a toptable booking, there was no problem to mix menus and the 2 hour turnaround wasn't imposed. I was particularly pleased that my request was granted and my friend was presented with truffles and a message in chocolate wishing her a personalised happy birthday. It really made the evening. Thanks Galvin! Will be back again soon!",3
"Went here on the set lunch offer for an 18th treat for our daughter. Staff were brilliant and so helpful and the atomosphere was the right blend of professional and yet relaxed. Not always as easy to achieve as it looks.
Views are spectacular helped by them kindly seating us at a lovely table in the window.
The food is a real treat.. The 2 vegetarians said it was the best they had ever had. Everything was wonderfully cooked and presented, All in all a real treat - cannot fault it.",4
"Very good fine dining food.  Ther staff were very attentive and the toliets were clean and very nice indeed! The ladies even have their own powder room with comfortable seats! The waitress was very perceptive and noticed my birthday card on the table.  When we moved to the bar area for drinks, there were chocolates decorated with happy birthday scrolled in chocolate cream.

A wonderful birthday experience and I will definitely be back for dinner or drinks to enjoy the views and service",4
"Galvin at Windows on Park Lane. 
We went for a special occasion, and werent disappointed with the overall experience - it felt special. Service was good generally, there was a minor hiccup which was elegantly sorted out with good grace. The views are wonderful, atmosphere was good, a little disappointed with the food, but not enough to say don't go. I would go again. definitely has got the wow factor.",4
"Galvins at the Windows - perfect setting, great food and extremely good service.",4
"Malmaison Brasserie Manchester.
Main restaurant area and bar is being renovated so there is a temporary area close to the hotel reception. Took advantage of the ¬£30 meal for two, have used the offer before but the menu choice this time was very limited and not very impressive.",3
Galvin at Windows was a very special evening with wonderful views over London from Bar as well as main restaurant. The meal was excellent. Very tender filet and white asparagus - a surprise to see on a menu in UK. Service was friendly and attentive. My only comment was that if feeled a bit rushed.,4
"On26th June my husband and I took our daughter  for her birthday to  lunch at Galvin at Windows,London.
The service was good,  the view amazing, food extremely mediocre. In fact after eating out at a lot of top London restaurants, this was extremely disappointing. Would never eat there again. Had set menu, portions couldn't have been smaller if they had tried, and had to send dessert back as it was awful! 
Manager took coffees off as a gesture, but didn't make up for a forgettable experience!",2
"Excellent meal with exceptional service.  However, the restaurant did not seem aware that we had booked to have the 'menu du chef' at the set price of ¬£39. They showed me the booking and said you had not advised them.  They did let us choose from that menu.
Excellent choice and the food and wine was absolutely delicious.  One of the best views of London.",4
"I went to Galvin at Windows for my birthday dinner. I think the service was wonderful. The food was good but the choices for the 3-course chef menu was quite limited. I ordered the pork and found it a bit too bland. The ambience was lovely and the view is quite amazing when the sky cleared up as it was raining quite a bit when I got there. Overall, I would recommend this place.",3
Malmaison Brasserie very busy not terribly organised took ages to get a drink and our food. We were charged with an extra bottle of wine which we did not ask for. Food was ok not the best.,1
Had an amazing meal at Galvin at Windows. The service was excellent as was the food. We ate from the tasting menu at ¬£85 per head and it was worth every penny. We didn't go for the wine to accompany every course and I'm glad we didn't having watched other diners leaving glass after glass of good wines. The views were also spectacular. Definitely worth a visit.,4
"Lively Friday evening venue but couples dine in hotel recption/access to rooms thoroughfare .

Friendly service.

Cold mocha inspite of asking them to microwave first attempt, 2nd mocha still cold.",3
"Had the special offer meal & was a bit disappointed as it was definitely not as good as the one we had in London.  The food was not as hot as it should have been, which was odd as we were the first in the restaurant.   Service good, but the ambience was odd:  everything was red & it therefore was rather dark & looked somewhat risque (Moulin Rouge etc).",3
"We had an absolutely lovely lunch at galvin at windows. The quality of food, the service was impeccable. We chose to order from the set menu. Although the choice was limited, everything we order was great. I would definitely return and most definitely recommend this place.",4
Fantasic view great food,4
"Loved the food - chicken was simply divine, and tarte tatin was the best I ever had!!! Service was spotlessly amazing, great seats, great view. Would definitely go back again... but probably at a lunch time, because the prices would be cheaper....
Would recommend 100%!",4
We really enjoyed our meal at galvin at windows. All three courses we very good and the staff were very friendly. It was a great lunch celebrating a birthday and the restaurant had amazing views of london. Very worth it with the three course meal deal. Would definitely go there again!,4
Beautiful restaurant with incredible views over London. Staff were extremely attentive almost to the point of awkward at times. The food was very good although I was expecting something a bit more spectacular. Is certainly worth a visit.,4
"Galvin at Windows - London, ordered the degustation menu with accompanying wines ¬£115 each, at which point the waitress said,(we heard) you have the choice of  champagne/wine with the first course so we happily said champagne, when the bill came there was the extra ¬£40 added which effectively meant we had both signed up for the ¬£135 champagne menu, so the point of asking for the wine deal was annoying. So 8 courses 4 of which were asparagus based maybe too much. Scallop with oyster was excellent",3
Beautiful views and amazing food!!!,4
"Galvin at Windows - Park Lane Hilton

Food was good - had the tasting menu which was a bit overloaded with asparagus! 
Pre-dessert berry compote dish was one of the finest i've ever tasted. 
atmosphere is lovely and the view is superb. 
Our waiter Roman was charming and very personable. 

a very nice experience all-round.",4
The evening was perfect. I went on tuesday and enjoyed it that much I had to bring another friend to try it out. Both of us were very impressed,4
"I had lunch on 27th May to celebrate my wife's birthday with her parents. It was excellent overall. We had the ¬£29 menu, which was great value for the standard of cooking and offered a good variety of choices. The food was delicious and the cooking high quality. Service was attentive without being oppressive and all the staff were friendly and welcoming. With the fantastic views, spacious layout and warm atmosphere, I'd recommend it to anyone for a real treat.",3
"Galvin at Windows (28th floor of the Hilton, Park Lane) was truly fabulous. The venue offers unparalleled views over London and all of the staff were attentive and friendly.
The food was magnificent - every course a delight. There were seven of us having lunch, and we were all hugely impressed. The sommelier chose some great wines for us and even gave me some interesting background on the cognacs. 
Yes, its not the cheapest, but that doesnt stop it being fantastic value.",4
A most enjoyable dinner at the Mal. Very good value and well prepared classics,3
"Requested a table with a view as we were celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary.  Table with a view was given, which was great!  Staff very attentive but yet not intrusive.  A lovely experience overall.  Will definitely go back there!  A great evening & one to remember!",4
Fantastic views,3
The waitress was amazing. She knew everything about the menu and with side dishes would compliment our meal. A lovely eveing.,4
Galvin at Windows - Great food plus spetacular view.,4
"Food was excellant, apart from in my opinion the potato rosti was burn't. Even though the head chef said it was meant to be like that. If you are a fan of cheese, they had one of the finest selections, I have ever come across with a very knowledgeable waiter to boot. However what lets this place down is the service, far to slow even though it's a small place with plenty of staff. The deal was well worth the ¬£30 if you can handle poor service.",3
Galvin at Windows in London's Hilton Park Lane hotel is the perfect venue for a special dinner.  The location on the top floor of the hotel provides a perfect panorama of the city.  Service is very friendly and highly efficient coupled with exceptional food.  The quality and presentation of the food and excellent service are well worth the cost.,4
"Galvin at Windows - Nice food, great views but rather expensive despite the attractive offer!",2
What a place...! Windows at Gavins is a special venue. Food is top quality service is fab and the view tops them all. Its a must. Hard to fault,4
"Our first visit to Galvin at Windows and we were very impressed with the service, even asking if we would like to finish our meals on a table with a view  into Buck hse gardens. Both the fish and Lamb starters were very good as was the tasty warm bread. We both had the skate which came with a lovely rich source. The pineapple desert was surprisingly good and probably the star of the show. We took the ¬£45 set meal which includes 1/2 a bottle of wine, water and coffee.",4
Good food and good value.,4
"Great service, professional and attentive without being pretentious.  The food was to a high standard and delivered on every course. Will use this as a venue for business lunches in the future.",3
"Went to Glavin at windows London with my mum and dad. Had the three courses for ¬£39 deal, which was really good value. Not massive to choose from but we all found something for each course we liked. Portions were nicely sized. Skate wing main was very nice and I particularly enjoyed the pannacotta pudding which was lovely. The taster menu looked amazing and is something for a special occasion. Amazing view is obviously one of the highpoints and the staff were really attentive and very friendly.",4
"I have eaten in Malmaison Brasserie before and enjoyed the experience.  The maitre d' was not aware that we had booked the Double Deal-and asked for a voucher, a touch embarrassing, though this was quickly dealt with. The mushroom starter had flavour if a little on the ""nouvelle cuisine"" side of portions. The guinea fowl was perfectly cooked and sat on a melt in the mouth potato rosti. Side of carrot and peas-nowt special. Apart form a wobbly table and a waitress with limited English-very good!",3
Excellent food !!! Nice view and attentive waiter.,4
"I took my girlfriend here for her birthday and she was blown away! We went for the tasting menu with wines and it was absolutely superb. Definitely one of the finest meals either of us have ever had (and we eat out at least twice a week). Can't recommend highly enough. Had read previous reviews about the main course being uninspirational.. but I have to say that they have clearly upped their act - we went for the lamb and it was beautifully done, adventurous and very tasty!",4
"Got a fantastic warm welcome back to Malmaison Mcr after not visiting for a good few months. The deal is fab, our red wine was delivered promptly and tasted good. Recommend the Pork and also Mushroom to start, both great. For main went for the lamb...arrived looking like crazy lamb fingers but boy did they taste good! Yum! Shared a fries...tasty. No room for dessert. Overall a fab experience and brilliant value...thanks mal...you rock!",4
"galvin at windows  london excellent location with views actross the capitals skyline , service polite and attentive,  food however was slightly underwhelming ,good but not excellent",3
"Galvin at Windows: it was the most magical birthday celebration we have ever had. my friends were most happy. brillian venue, amazing food: scallops!!! salmon! venison!!! beef! apple tart!!! my fish was a bit boring but maybe I was being too picky. great vine selection, affordable, efficient advice. service was just right, we felt at home there. view and everything is brilliant.

Toptable: totally dissapointed as I booked ¬£39pp deal and paid ¬£65pp at the restaurant. It absolutely put me off.",4
"I visited Galvin at Windows at the Park Lane in London in April. I had a really fantastic time. The view over London was magnificent. Food was excellent. Staff were friendly and polite. My only minor negative point is that the waiters were perhaps a little too eager - every time I took a sip of water, one would appear to refill my glass! However, this was a very minor thing, and overall it was a great experience and I would most definitely go again.",4
Celebrated my birthday at Galvin at Windows for the second year running. The service was fantastic and the food divine. We will definitely be back again!,4
"had a wonderful lunch at Galvin at Windows in London for our 36th wedding anniversary.
The food, atmosphere and attentive, friendly staff made it a great experience",4
Birthday meal at Galvin at Windows on top of the Hilton on London's Park Lane was enjoyed by all. An early evening start allowed enjoyment of the spectacular view by daylight and lit up. The food was pretty good across the board. My only niggle is paying the same price for a vegetarian meal as for the carnivore version.The service was good but lacked continuity of waiting staff.,3
Great view and service.,3
"Very attentive service. Lovely setting / ambience. Excellent 3 course meal plus a pre-starter for ¬£39 pp. Beautifully presented and extremely tasty and original. Other additions,, e.g. drinks and coffee are expensive - but would go again on special occasions.",4
"The food was great, we had the beef which was cooked to perfection. The ambience was brilliant with 180 degree views of Hyde park and surrounding areas. The service was of a high standard and they made our visit comfortable.",3
Galvin at Windows on Park Lane was a lovely place to go for drinks and formal dining with beautiful views.  The food however was fair - nothing to rave about but more of a place to be impressed by the surroundings.,2
"A stunning venue with welcoming staff, making you feel very comfortable upon arrival. Will most certainly return - perfect for that special occassion.",4
"We had a wonderful family meal here to celebrate my mother's birthday. Great food, great views of London. Waiter service was attentive and all the staff were very accommodating. A majority of the other customers seemed to comprise of a certain suit-donning crowd which gave the atmosphere into a slight shade of executives and less of a relaxed, cosy family environment but we all enjoyed our night regardless.",4
"Went to lunch at Galvin@Windows London today and enjoyed a lovely meal with good attentive not intrusive service.
They brought a nice touch of chocolates and truffles for my wife's birthday.",4
"View makes it special and the service is the best. Food was excellent too.
Alacarte, two courses with a glass of wine came to ¬£230 for two, bit steep. Special occasion dining..",3

Very good service and not excellent, because the staff was a bit too pushy; very good food, but the quantity was a bit too small.",3
"Galvin at Windows, London was a nice experience although the the number of staff was a bit overkill. The food was nice, but not spectaculat. Our waitress was lovely and very attentive and managed this without being intrusive. I would recommend the restaurant but try to get a table at the window as the views are amazing.",4

"We booked Galvin at windows for an anniversary dinner. We were going to have the 3 courses for ¬£39. We changed our minds and went for the seven course taster menu.

A great evening. Superb views.",4

The degustation menu was very well thought out and very well matched with the wine. Foie gras + wine amazing. 

We finished 9 courses and we were happily full.",4
"Dinner at Galvin at Windows, London Hilton, on Wednesday 16th March 2011.
Delicious as always - took my nephew who was ""bowled over"" with his venison he is now hooked.  Service impeccable, staff attentive without being OTT and  friendly but not intrusive. Greeting staff could have been a little more relaxed - reminded me of a pair of ""bouncers"" but I guess that is their job - will ask next time.   Will dine there again. Love the busy, but muted atmosphere the restaurant creates.",4
Food was very nice but service and cleanliness leave a lot to be desired.  Try the City or Abode Hotel if dining in Piccadilly.,2
"Very small portions (had to eat later again, which is not like me after a 3-course meal) but great tasting food, great view and OK service.",3
"We had a great time. Food was excellent, staff were very attentive in nice surroundings",4
"went to Galvin at Windows in the London Hilton for wife's birthday. service was excellent and included nice happy birthday chocolate plate. we had ¬£39 menu with three options per course, all were really tasty and well presented. price did rather notch up with champagne wine coffee and service though. if we go back, and we may for a special occassion i might be tempted by the ¬£115 tasing menu with wine in the end not so much more. great views over london too",4

Offer bookedDouble daring acts of dining : Two courses & a bottle of wine ¬£30.00 for 2 people 

Great food- wine a bit dodgy so would definitely recommend taking up the offer of a ten pound credit on a different bottle of wine!",4
Had a lovely meal at Galvin at Windows. The setting provides a wonderful view over London and the staff are attentive but not intrusive. The Top Table lunch deal was good value especially as it included a glass of champagne.,4

"Malmaison Brasserie - Manchester.

Attentive service, Food was lovely although you do need to order additional sides to accompany the main dishes. The parfait starter was fab, Would definitely return!",4
"Fantastic restaurant, flawless service, and incredible food.  In short, everything you'd expect from a Michelin-starred restaurant, but for a ridiculously low price that includes the best bread, petits fours and coffee I've been served in a long time. Will definitely keep coming back.",4
Found the main slightly boring but wonderful starter and dessert. Lovely setting and service is very good.,3
"We chose Galvin at Windows for a birthday celebration and went to the Degustation menu with Champagne - what a fabulous meal with perfectly suited wines with each course.  Exquisite food, beautifully presented and attentive but not intrusive service ...and great views out over London.  Not a cheap evening but worth every penny.",4
"We had an evening meal at Galvin at Windows, London Hilton, 22 Park Lane. It was an early sitting so a lot of staff being very very attentive early on but cannot fault the food or the very friendly, informative staff. However, no opportunity was offered to confirm the Top Table offer that we had booked under and therefore ended up paying full price for the meal which was over ¬£100 more than initially intended / booked for.",4
Excellent - What a view!!,4
An excellent experience in every sense of the word. The service was faultless and food sublime. Great value for a fixed price lunch including wine.,4
First class meal and food-Malmaison never disappoints,4
"Galvin is a spectacular setting and the food was really nice well presented a d served by professionals.

My only gripe, if I had one was it was my girlfriends birthday and I had requested a table by a window which I didn't get.

Recommended",4
"Malmaison Brasserie, Manchester ‚Äì Another very pleasant evening using a ¬£30 deal. Great value for money. The chicken liver parfait starter was very nice though it should actually be served with brioche rather than triangular cut regular bread. Being a sausage fan I went for cumberland sausage and mash for main. The outers were lovely and caramelised, succulent in the middle, mash was smooth and the sticky jus was delicious. Very comforting. My friends sea bass was also very nice. Yummy!",4
"A fantastic first-class evening at Galvin. My partner and I had a memorable night in very memorable surroundings. The service was wonderful and attentive, food was attractive and delicious. The portions look small, but after dessert we were stuffed! Only negative is that the price is rather steep and doesn't include service charge, but worth a top table offer on a very special occasion.",4
"Malmaison in Manchester, lovely restaurant, quite dark and moody ambience but nice and quiet for a client lunch or catch up. good service, ok value for money. recommend!",3
Lovely food with professional but friendly service. Very reasonable lunch set menu but watch for those coffees to finish!,4

"Galvin at The Windows, a definite favourite.  They did a special chocolate plate for my friend's 40th.  Fantastic service and beautiful food.  Not to mention the incredible views over London.",4
"Great venue. Incredible service. On the special deal, very limited choices given. Whilst what we could chose was great, the food itself did not leave a feel of total satisfaction as my wife and I both felt a little pekish afterwards.",3
"Very good experience from service to food and views. If I have to make a negative comment it would be, a hair in the bread (which I did not inform anyone of), a pheasant being told it was rare but was cooked through well and the starter of chicken could have used just a dash more sauce. Besides those really minor details, excellent location and will return again. I encourage you to visit.",3
Another excellent experience at Manchester best Sunday Dining venue,4
"Galvin at Windows was a superb evening!  We were treated like celebrities - the staff were warm, friendly and made us feel special!  The food was absolutely fantastic, with extra care taken with the presentation and prepared to perfection! The portions were spot on and the wine list provided a range of affordable options. As this was a birthday celebration, it was a very special evening all round!  Thank you very much to all at Windows!",4
"A beautiful venue, fantastic views from most tables in the bar and restaurant.

The restaurant manager was unaware that we had made a reservation on three courses for ¬£39 offer and was unable to supply a glass of italian bubbly.

The food was great albeit I thought the portions were small in comparison to other top restaurants I have eaten in.

The service was attentive without being intrusive, therefore allowing my good friend and I to enjoy our meal, the views and the evening.",3
"I cam here with my family and it was one of the best meals i've had in London. The view was phenomenal, service was fantastic and the food was great. Well recommended.",4
Lunch at Galvin at Windows was a real treat.  Shame it was a foggy day so the views were obscured. We had the set menu at ¬£45 for 3 courses with a bottle of wine and coffee which was great value for money.,4
"The meal was excellent, but disapointed at dress code (very scruffy for a special occasion) Clients were in scruffy jeans, tee shirts and trainers, music far to loud in bar unable to carry out conversation, staff unable to lower volume",4
The food at Galvin at Windows was excellent. The meal deal was good value but somewhat compromised by the price of wine which was very expensive. Service and location however made it a memorable event.,4
"Windows, London

Great ambience and very warm reception!",3
"Galvin at Windows-Hyde Park Hotel-London
Excellent. Interesting food very well presented,lovely location and service was the best. Really recommend",4
"Galvin at Windows was what it said on the tin.  The views were great and the food was pleasant.  We felt rushed to place an order when we arrived, although we were not late at all.  It seems a shame when the table didnt need to be turned and we were actually in the restaurant for 3 hours and therefore could have had longer reading the menu.  We felt there were too many staff looking after us, one or two faces would have be more than adequate.  We did have a lovely evening though.",3
We had a very enjoyable meal at Galvin at Windows. The food was off a very high standard and the ¬£39 for 3 courses deal was well worth it. Would go back again. Great views across London as well.,4
Our meal at Galvin at Windows in the London Park Lane Hilton was superb. The food was incredible and the service was faultless. We had the tasting menu with wine. The wines were extremely well matched to the food. Each course was beautifully presented and tasted heavenly. We would definitely return.,4
My family and daughters boyfriend had a very enjoyable meal at Galvin at Windows in the London Hilton.  We all found something we liked even though we had chosen the rduced offer menu.,3
"Galvin at Windows in London has superb views and  excellent food. Portions are just right, service is excellent and the lunch option offers superb value for money given location and quality. It helps that the lifts in the Hilton have been refurbished.",4
From the moment we entered Galvin at Windows we were very well taken care of.  The staff were very attentive and everything was well presented.  If it hadn't have been so foggy the views from the restaurant would have been spectacular.  We opted for the offer of ¬£39 for 3 courses and we could not fault the food in anyway.  The main course of pork loin was delicious and the presentation of every course was everything you would expect from fine dining.  Would I visit again...definitely!,3
"My wife and I enjoyed a 3 course lunch with excellent service.  Fabulous food, well recommended wine and a great view completed a wonderful afternoon.",3
"We arrived a few minutes early at Galvin at Windows at the Hilton on Park Lane and were sent to have a coffee ... we then sat for fully 30 mins before I asked at the desk WHEN our table would be ready (by which time our time schedule had slipped from comfortable to tight).  
Many apologies followed; together with a complimentary glass of bubbly.
Thereafter we enjoyed the service and food we had expected, and we were not dissappointed.",4
"Galvin at Windows, london
Great venue and superb service. Very high quality food although main course could have been a bit warmer. Only main point is that we were sat near to the bar and the noise from the music was a little loud.
Would thoroughly recommend for a special occasion.",3
"Impecable food, service and views! The only drawbacks were the toilets where there are only two stalls in the ladies for the dining room and bar. Plus, we found the service in the bar to be neglectful, particularly compared to the dining room.",4
"The food was excellent and the service top class. The view from the restaurant just added to the enjoyment of the day. We shall definitely retun for further meals at Galvin at Windows
The set menu offer from Toptable made it excellent value too",4
"Went for lunch at Galvin at window.Food was great,the view was great,the staff wasn't so.Didn't describe the dishes,didn't smile at all.Men always served first,i didn't like it.I think they should work on it,customers want to be more involved and more supported.
As a michelin star restaurant they definitely have to offer a better service.",2
"Enjoyed a wonderful lunch at Galvin @ Windows, The London Hilton, Park Lane.  The service was excellent, staff professional and friendly, food was delicious - served hot and with appropriate timeliness. The views across London were stunning. I would definately go again.",4
"Galvin at Windows London Hilton, 22 Park Lane, London, W1K 1BE
Fantastic evening - went for a celebration dinner and had a throughly enjoyable evening. The food was faultless and the staff were curtious attentive and totally unintrusive. Would thoughly recommend.",4
Galvin at Windows - excellent food - thought the set menu was a bit limited in choice but the maitre'd was extremely helpful in helping my guests choose something more suitable for their taste. It's a shame they do not hold tables in the bar area for diners to have a pre-dinner drink rather than standing at the bar!,3
"Windows was one of the nicest resturants that I have ever dined at. The waiters were attentive but not over powering and the food was delightful.  The view was amazing and the overall experience was one that I would highly recommend. I think for the price of the food the experience was well worth it !

The only negative was in the bar where it was EXTREMELY busy and we were unable to get a seat or served easily which was a great shame so we were unable to relax after the meal with a drink.",4
"My partner and I dined at Galvin at Windows to celebrate my 30th birthday. Fortunately he was paying because it's not cheap, but the quality of the food and the attentiveness of the staff made this a hugely enjoyable occasion.

All of our courses were beautifully presented and delicious and the staff really could not be faulted-I am 7 months pregnant and a cushion was placed on my chair without me requesting it!

Overall a lovely meal for a special occasion or more often if you can afford it",3
"I had an amazing evening at Galvin at Windows. Firstly, the views are amazing - it would make for a really romantic meal....though I was on my own and thoroughly enjoyed it. I had the tasting menu with wines and this was excellent. The service was fantastic too. Definitely recommend.",4
"Galvin at Windows is situated at the 28th floor of the Hilton Hotel over-looking Hyde Park. Its the tallest building in its area so you get unobstructed views of the surrounding areas. 

My wife and I had dinner there and I had requested a table with a view for our first anniversary. Not only did they give us seats with a view, but they also surprised us with several after-dinner chocolates on a plate that had ""Happy Anniversary"" written on it in chocolate sauce - fantastic!",4
"Good food and great view.

Wouldn't recommend handing in belongings to the cloak room.",3
"The venue is wonderful with an incredible view over London. The food was also excellent. We did feel that the service was somewhat overbearing with waiters hovering around all the time, and that we were slightly rushed through our meal.",3
"Galvin at Windows, London is a wonderful introduction to fine dining. We enjoyed three courses from the set menu; confit of duck, chaterelle mushroom risotto were especially tasty; green tea ice cream superb. Service was personable and receptive, if slightly unnerving ‚Äì six waiters attended our every move. We were even given extra green tea ice cream. While the beige and gold decor gives it the sepia, dusty feel of one of Gatsby‚Äôs parties, the view of  the city from the 28th floor is incredible.",4
"Galvin at Windows 
London Hilton, 22 Park Lane, London, W1K 1BE

good place for small group building up relationships.",4
Galvin at Windows - London Hilton.  Truly perfect.,4
Had a lovely 21st meal at Galvin at Windows. Wonderful service and superb food. A meal to remember!,4
"Galvin at Windows is a stunning venue.  The food is excellent and the view is amazing.  The staff are very attentive (but not overpoweringly so) and everything is presented beautifully.  I did have to send my main course back as it was not quite cooked how I requested it, however, I received a brand new main course and was not charged for it at all.  Would revisit this venue for sure.",4
"Galvin at Windows, London:
Amazing views, attentive service, good food.  We went for the ¬£39 3 course menu which made it affordable.  The atmosphere is a bit businessy though.",3
"Galvin at Windows, London
Great food, great offer, amazing view and the most fantastic service! Would definately go again!",4
"First time at Windows & not the last I hope...
Went for my birthday celebration with my wife and son (8 months).  Had a fantastic experience.  Service was impeccable, staff made us feel welcome making a fuss of the baby with a high chair and couple of toys to keep him amused..!! 
The food was sublime.  The selection on the prix fixes was great.  Went for the  wine, water and coffee option (¬£45). Not cheap but fantastic value when you take all in to account. 
Would recommend for a treat!",4
"Excellent service and friendly staff.  Ambience a little sterile,  Good food at about the right price.",3
"We had a fantastic time at Galvin at Windows. Firstly had a drink in the bar to take in the views of the city, then went through to dinner. We went for toptable deal (3 courses ¬£39) and the staff made us feel really welcome. Delicious food and good choices. Would definitely go again!",4
"Went for Sunday lunch. Food in general was very good, but let down by the roast potatoes, which had clearly been reheated and were flabby and tasteless. However, the soup to start was very good, as was the roast pork. Staff were extremely polite and attentive. If they could just get the roast potatoes right, it would be the perfect place for Sunday lunch. Only 2 other tables in the place which left it a bit lacking in atmosphere.",4
"Dinner at Galvin at Windows - London - fantastic views, very attentive service, lovely food - all good!",4
"Cenamos en Galvin At Windows en Londres. El lugar es espectacular muy elegante, tienes literalmente Londres a tus pies. Habia mucha gente anoche y el segundo plato se hizo esperar un poco mas de lo debido. El precio de la cerveza lo encontre excesivo 7.5 libras por una Budweiser. La comida muy buena aunque el entrante de confit de pato no estaba rematado del todo. La dorada estaba exquisita y los chocos estaban cortadosde una forma muy original.  .El detalle del gazpacho, me llego al alma.",3
"This was a birthday special meal for my daughter at Galvin at Windows at the Hilton Park Lane, London and it was superb! Food, on the ¬£27 for 3 courses lunch menu, and the service were both excellent and the views spectacular! I would definitely recommend it.",4
Impeccable service + Delightful food + Fabulous view = Amazing time.,4
"Excellent service - charming and sat us at a window table which we really enjoyed. Did all the birthday thing for us. Produced a kids menu that was great for my 10 yr old who loved the beef sirloin and choc pudding. Hotel lobby looks a bit tired but restaurant fine. 
Loved the sea bream. Crispy and tender.",3
2nd meal here and it was just as good as the 1st time.  Food is still excellent.  The waiters are all very knowledgeable.  Good attentive service without the feeling of someone watching your every move.  The views are amazing.  When I recieved my reminder call the day before.  The lady I spoke too warned me of the road closures that were going to be in place.  This I found very helpful and thoughtful.,4
"FANTASTIC!!!!!!

Galvin at Windows on Park Lane is a must for anyone looking for something special for that special occasion. Food was amazing, wine was great and the attention to detail is unbelievable.

Prices are very reasonable too.",4
"I went for a meal at Galvin at Window on a friday evening for my girlfriends birthday. It was a fantastic experience, we had the toptable offer which was good value at ¬£35 for 3 courses. I was expecting an expensive drinks bill but there are a number of wines from ¬£20 per bottle. I would love to go back as the food and views were great.",4
"We went to Galvin at Windows for a birthday dinner and it was nothing short of excellent. The staff were friendly and very attentive but not intrusive, food was exquisite and wine was well matched. The view was also great especially as the sun went down.",4
"The food gets 9/10 based simple on the fantastic deserts we had!  Though the Starter and the Main courses we also very good.
The Service was very attentive without being intrusive.
Ambience is subdued, international which is pleasent, but the real bonus is the unrivalled view over central London.
The toilets were okay, but I have rated them better simple due to th elovely lady at the Cloak Check",4
"Every course was excellent. The views over london, great food and wonderful service, delivered an exceptional overall experience.",4
"Tried the barbecue menu and was very impressed, corn pancakes were particularly good, crab claws a little over cooked but the prawns were excellent -- would recommmend....",3
"A group of 4 of us were particularly underwhelmed by Galvin at WIndows. The staff were friendly and helpful but for a michelin starred restaurant, the food lacked any kind of wow factor. It was pretty standard fare and a disappointment.",2
I was at Galvin at Windows with a friend last night. We had a nice time however it wasn't entirely down to food or the service! The food was good value for money though the portions could have been bigger. However we felt that the waiting staff were rushing us eventhough we were dining well under the two hours allocated to us. At the end we had to go to the bar area to finish our drinks. Overall it was a good experience. We loved the view. I would recommend it for special occasions only.,2
"Only down side were the toilets, only two female toilets of the whole bar and restaurant. Only issue though, apart from that it was a superb evening",4
"Visited Galvin at Windows in London with my husband a couple of weeks back for a nice night out.

We took advantage of the TT deal & the food was great although even with the deal quite expensive when you add in wine and other extras. Most memorable part of the meal was the melon soup I had for entree which was a real pleasure to look at (and eat!) We decided to have a cocktail in the bar afterwards, the view is amazing but drinks are extremely pricey. Overall, fab but bring your credit card!",3
"I rate this place very highly, it's a cut above and has a special feel about it. Food is tasty, fresh and of a high quality and priced well particularly if you go for one of the offers. Staff were attentive and knowledgeable. I'll be heading back for my birthday.",4
"Great vue from the 28th floor. Very friendly and professional staff. Desserts may not be their best skills, but the rest is! The cod was very good, even for us  Norwegians' standards.",4
"I went to Galvin at Windows for dinner with my partner for our anniversary on a Thursday evening. The food was fantastic and the service was extremely attentive,it was quite busy and the atmosphere was friendly and comfortable. I will definitely be recommending to my friends & family!",4
Great location & atmosphere at Galvin at Windows.The ¬£35 for 3 courses was good value but we were a little disapointed by the quality of the food compared to offers at other michelin star restaurants. One of our courses was late but service after that was great and we were given a complimentary course from the tasting menu which was delicious - a totally different class to the ¬£35 a la carte menu. We'd go back for the tasting menu for a special occcasion,3
"Another enchanting lunch at Galvin at Windows up in the clouds at Park Lane Hilton in London.  You are almost swamped with staff and with welcomes but it's worth running the gauntlet for the ambience and for the wonderful food.  Imaginative, tasty and excellent quality.  Pick anything you like and it will be exquisite!!  Leave room for the trademark marshmallows with coffee and join the poll on whether the lime or the strawberry ones are more heavenly!!",4
"First of all, what a view. You would expect as much on the 28th floor on Park Lane, but it really is a great place to spot all the places you'd visited during a day out in London. I've dined in Mayfair many times and the service here really was the best I've received to date - attentive, friendly but not intrusive. Toilets were ok, but the cubicle was surprisingly small (and I'm a very average 5'11"" guy). Food was also very good for ¬£22 on a two course set menu. Recommended.",4
"Galvin at Windows was fantastic. The staff were so attentive, helpful and full of smiles. The food was delicious and a bargain at ¬£35 each. We ate our dinner in the restaurant and then went to the bar section. It was really quite funky with an amazing atmosphere. A fab way to finish our night!",4
"Galvin at Windows - Park Lane, London
Food mostly disappointing. Butter warm, rancid. Mineral water warm. Turbot ooverdone,tasteless, lamb uninteresting, baby leek  virtually raw: crunchy. Fresh baked bread excellent, 2nd batch of butter lovely. Seared scallops nice but raw in centre. Clams and turbot sauce nice. Chocolate pudding out of this world. Glass of Merlot nice. Views so-so -  no major landmarks visible. Wine waiter hopeless, other staff excellent. Manager kindlty took us to see views.",2
Great meal at Galvins.  Perfect for a treat.  Food and service was excellent,4
"We visited Galvin at Windows and were suitably impressed. We opted for the menu degustation - 8 courses with accompanying wines and we were eating for a good two hours! Food was great with the mushroom cep risotto, the scallops and the lamb being the highlights. Service was very attentive without being instrusive. Spectacular views as you'd expect and we were even lucky enough to get a free rainbow across the London skyline thanks to the earlier downpour! Not easy on the wallet but woth it!",4
We had a wonderful evening. The view is stunning so recommend a window table. The food was divine and the service unbeatable..,4
terrific!,3
"This was special with sunset over London,excellent food and great service. We had the ¬£35 offer amazing value for money with little extras thrown in. We'll be back to try for the full menu.",4
"Enjoyed a wonderful dinner with my boyfriend at Galvin at Windows, Hilton Park Lane (London). The food was delicious and the service absolutely faultless. The 3 courses for ¬£35 was good value for the food, though we ended up spending a fair bit on extras...! Would definitely recommend for a treat!",4
The setting and the service were incredible. The food was nice but not as good as expected. Great value with the offer.,4
"Simply wonderful experience. The view, the ambience, the service. We went for the menu degustation and every course was perfect. Highly recommend and will certainly return.",4
"Very good lunch, set menu was great value. Lovely views and great service. We stayed until 4.30 with no problems from the restaurant.

Have now been twice and its maintaining its excellence.",3
"Food at Galvins Windows W1 excellent. Unexpected appalling behavior from one waitor. He asked me why I hadn't touched my amuse bouche. I replied that i couldn't quite reach for it as there were the menus (half on my lap) and the cocktails, water, wine, breadboard...between me and the appetiser. He made an insolent remark before summoning another waiter to attend to problem. Coffee arrived simultaneously w desserts. The other staff were pleasant. 2 Caucasian male diners nearby had better service",3
"This place is fantastic.  The views are stunning, the food is extremely nice and the service is attentive and pleasnant without being imposing.

Would highly reccomend for a special occasion.",4
"Galvin at Windows in London was fantastic yet again.  The food, service and setting would be hard to beat.  At ¬£27 for three courses, the set lunch is a bargain. We had the extra offer of half a bottle of wine each, coffee and  delicious chocs for ¬£42 in total.  Can't wait to go back.",4
Our lunch at Galvins at Windows was OK but not in any way special. The service from the word go was exceptional but the food from the 3 course for ¬£27 menu was less than exciting. My exotic sounding soup tasted like fruit juice poured over tiny bits of melon. The main duck course was very small and a little tough. The view is great of course and the ambience congenial. But not somewhere I'd hurry back to.  And the cost of three vodkas and tonics was very high.,3
"Service and ambience were excellent, and the main course (chateaubriand) perfect however the starter of terrine foie gras was uninspiring and the price was on the steep side (even if it does have a michelin star).",3
"Hilton - Park Lane

Wow, wow and wow. Amazing food, amazing presentation. Extremely attentive a polite service. A totally enjoyable experience. Beautiful views. Hard to go wrong with their wine list also. Possibly the best restaurant I've eaten at in London.",4
"We had our anniversary dinner at Galvin at Windows, Mayfair. Requested a window seat, however did not get it. The seats in the middle are slightly elevated though, so you can still enjoy the view from afar

Ordered the Top Table 3 course ¬£35 menu, which was good value.  The starters and mains were excellent, with the dessert a little lacking in my opinion (ordered mackerel brandade and Skate, then the Cod and Duck, then the Peach and lemon meringe)

The service was very attentive,& very good",4
"Enjoyed a very pleasant weeknight dinner at Galvins - party of 9 had fantastic window table and enjoyed extremely attentive service. Chose from the Party menu and after a tomato consume jelly amuse bouche, the majority chose salmon&crab (pleasingly citrusy), beef medallions with fois gras (tender but very rich) and a unusual herby Basil Creme Brulee (pudding envy for my companion's chocolate palet with praline and mango - declared best pud ever. Highy recommend Galvins for special evening",4
"I've dined at Galvin at Windows various times and it never fails to impress. The staff are fantastic - always friendly and extremely helpful & professional. The atmosphere intimate and the food as good as the views.

I have no hesitation recommending this venue for either a romantic meal or one with friends - especially when there is a deal on!",3
"We had the top table dinner special ¬£35 for 3 courses at Galvin Windows last night. Although the menu was quite limited (3 choices per course) the food was delicious especially the cod and the duck as mains. Wonderful views, great light, airy room, great service and very enjoyable. Would recommend.",4
The food was excellent and the service very friendly and efficient.,4
"Had a very good evening at Galvin at Windows at the Hilton. The food was very good and served at a good pace, so you did not feel rushed. The staff also very attentive and friendly. Would definately recommend especially if you can get a window seat!",3
"Malmaison Brasserie, Manchester ‚Äì This was my first visit back since a sub-standard experience some months ago‚Ä¶ and I was pleasantly surprised. Things seem back to normal again at Malmaison. Good, happy service and food (with no mix ups) as it used to be. Their '3 Tenners' promotion is very good value for Mon-Thurs dining... though, it may just be me but I feel the wine given with this offer is not as good as usual. A nice, relaxing evening in all. I'll be back for more.",4
We had a lovely meal on the set lunch.  The service was excellent and we would thoroughly recommend.,4
Really nice atmosphere and the waiting staff really attentive. Food was ok the vegetarian the food wasn't that impressive. Saying that though it was a lovely evening and restaurant.,3
Views from the restaurant are great and it's worth turning up early for a cocktail at the bar. Service was very attentive and the menu itself was good value though worth remembering that the drinks are still at standard prices!,4
Very enjoyable meal and service and ambience excellent. A little light on the vegetarian selection.,4
The food was lovely and the service was very attentive.  We didn't get a table near one of the windows but that didn't really matter as the views were easy to see wherever you sit.,4
Galvin at WIndows is an apt name for a restaurant on the 28th floor with views over Buckingham Palace.  The food was excellent - we all chose the same thing and were not disappointed in superbly selected and cooked fish.  If I say the highlights of the meal were the home-made marchmallows with coffee that does not diminish the rest but shows that an imaginative touch can make all the difference and charm the customer!,4
"The restaurant has a stunning outlook over London but unfortunately our table's view was somewhat impeded, this was maybe to be expected with a last minute reservation. The service and the food were of a high standard and the value of the lunch set menu is very good. The Salmon was very fresh and the pork was cooked to perfection, all in all a good lunch.",3
"Uncertain when we went in, as we'd read others' reviews. Yes, the portion sizes are not huge; but they don't need to be, as the quality overcomes the quantity. My wife and I have hearty appetites but the food experience was so good that we were comforatbly satisfied. It was delightful, identifying many ingredients.
Our table, on the second row away from the windows still provided an excellent panorama.
The service was extremely attentive, but sensitive; not intrusive.
Very enjoyable indeed.",4
Galvin at Windows has one of the best views over London which in someways makes a trip there worthwhile in its own right.  We went to try the deal (¬£35 for 3 courses) which was a fairly limited set menu though the quality of the food was very good.  Good sommelier recommended a nice wine and a pre-dinner drink at the bar made for a pleasant evening.  Bill ended up being ¬£200 though so even on the deal not a value night out.,3
Great little semi-private room just off the main dining room is perfect for informal business meets.  (big enough for 10).  Food fine with decent steaks. Only criticism would be that the lobster/crab gratin starter  is miniscule. Cheese plate v good.  Service good.,3
"Galvins was a great location overlooking all of london, food was decent and service was very prompt, however it being in park lane, you get the impression that your paying for a location, not really the food and service...etc",4
"I chose Galvin at Windows to celebrate my partners birthday. Was a good experience, with excellent views over London and good food (even if the portions were on the small side).

The one thing that let it down was the stereotypically snooty french waiter, who looked down his nose at us for choosing the 3 course ¬£35 menu and one glass of house wine each, and the fact I had the audacity to ask about something on the menu that I didn't think I'd like. Didn't let it spoil our evening though",3
"The view is amazing, the waiters attentive and the food lovely. I couldn't fault Galvin although the wine was a little expensive. However the Hilton left much to be desired. We waited for quite a while for an elevator to arrive and a queue of people waited behind us. A lady who worked there told us the elevator was going to be used privately for a saudi family who requested this and we would have to wait again, even though they were at the back of the queue. Why were we treated as 2nd class?",4
"Went to Galvins for a birthday treat with friends and we really enjoyed seeing London from the top. The ambience is great, the food is really good and the waiters are attentive. Perhaps too attentive at first - we had 5 waiters taking orders for drinks and food separately and serving which was not private at all. And they kept forcing us to order more wine and water. But otherwise very nice, will go again.",4
"Galvin At Windows was good but disappointing overall, I suspect because we were on the TT offer. We were seated at one of the obviously secondary tables and presented  with a set menu with a much-reduced selection, not ""the a la carte menu"". Service was good but indecently rushed: we struggled to last an hour at the table. Food was good, not exceptional, and portions small. Views were great, for what we could see of them.",3
"Dinner at Galvins London Hilton for our Anniversary was lovely. Had a table near the balcony, however view was slightly misty because of the weather.  Staff very attentive and friendly. Would definitely go back, perhaps for lunch.",4
"We had the special offer lunch at Galvin at Windows, the food was lovely but the portion size of the main course could have been more generous. 
We liked the fact that you could order 2 small glasses of wine with the meal. 
The service was impeccable and the 2hour turnaround felt leisurely.",4
"Back to second time,me and my friends love the food.",3
Lunch at 'Galvin at Windows' at the London Hilton in Park Lane is a superb location for a special occasion such as my wife's 60th birthday. Yet again we we treated with courtesy together with splendid service and a great meal.,4
"Had lunch at Galvin at windows. Food delicious, well presented and good variety offer. Service was fantastic, without being intrusive. I would thouroughly reccommend this top table ¬£27 for 3 courses offer. Enjoy! We did!",4
"The food here is great, however on this occasion the service was very slow.
A lunch time meal shouldn't take 2hrs.",3
"We had a superb lunch at Galvin at Windows at the top of London Hilton. The views are magnificent, staff attentive and food lovely.",4
"This was the second time I have been to Galvin at  Windows and the experience met expectations again. Fantastic food, great views, attentive and but not overbearing staff, just lovely! Can't wait to go back again!",4
"Was with two lady friends, had a fantastic taster night with Chris Galvin himself. As always, the food was excellent (the lamb slightly over cooked for my taste, but very good nonetheless). The real plus point was the care that had been taken in pairing the wine with the courses. A fantastic Muscadet with creme brulee was a combination to die for! This is definitely going to remain a regular.",4
"No salads for the main course if you want salads. Besides this the food is great, good service, great for a quick client lunch. Would recommend.",4
"One of the best views in London, overlooking a gorgeous summer day in Hyde Park, the green a magical background to a super 3 course meal. A perfectly quivering poached ducks egg swirled around by an absolutely delicious pea veloute, a sinfully decadent risotto of peas, broad beans, parmesan and asparagus and a rich, dense chocolate tart with mango and cumin to finish a fabulous evening, all washed down with a few glasses of excellent pinot gris. A fabulous evening...",3
"Food, atmosphere and service is good.",4
"Service, food, vine and views are excelent. Slightly upsetting that we were setting not near the window, but on the second row.",4
"Galvin at Windows TT deal - had a wonderful dining experience. Waiters are alert and friendly. Went on an awesome sunny Sunday for lunch. All up with the lovely textures and flavours of each course, great service, great views, i highly recommend it to anyone wanting to go. I will be happy to go again.",4
We chose the 3 courses lunch option which was excellent value for money. Fantastic atmosphere and great views. We went on a Friday so there were quite a view City people but otherwise quite a mixed crowd. The food was to a high standard but inevitably on the small side. Amazing views on a sunny day and very good service. Highly recommend for lunch any time.,4
"As usual, great food and service! The pea veloute with duck eggs was absolutely tasty and the Hake was served to perfection.",4
"Great view, overpriced food.  We want on ¬£35 per person offer from a la carte menu.  Be careful with that deal - there are 3 set menus, of which a la carte is the worst one.  There's actually nothing of value there at all.  So we had to go for the ¬£65 per person menu (next one up) when we got there.  Still, so-so.  Perhaps the ¬£85 pp menu is a bit better, but I strongly recommend to go there once you've had a meal beforehand.  The restaurant itself is lovely tho, so go for the views.",3
Great food and atmosphere. Even on the set menus beware as it's easy to run up a reasonable drinks bill! Enjoyed lunch of a Sunday overlooking London. Well worth a visit,3
"Our Sunday Lunch at Galvin at Windows, Park Lane, was excellent, good quality food, the service was fabulous, very helpful yet discreet, would definitely recommend.",4
Galvins is a great venue with wonderful views over London. We went for the tasting menu and the accompanying wines - fantastic food and great wines.,4
"My first visit.   Simply, OUTSTANDING!! Food was a delight, View is amazing and Best of all the very attentive staff. We went there for our anniversary, and as one of the waiters had spotted us exchanging cards and gifts had established the occasion and we received a surprise plate of assortments of chocolates with  Happy Anniversary sprinkled on the plate. A great touch, and credit to all the waiters. Will return.",4
"Malmaison Brasserie, Manchester - A great place for OK food with good service and decent wine in a nice atmosphere. We selected from the limited Homegrown & Local menu, 2 courses for ¬£15.50 or 3 courses for ¬£17.50. My Goats Cheese & Walnut Salad starter was not overflowing with flavour, nor did it contain much cheese, but the Steak Frites was pleasant enough. But who wants just pleasant? A great '3 tenners' offer is available, check their website for 'full' terms and conditions before you dine.",3
"Galvin at Windows on the 28th Floor of the Hilton Park Lane. Was an amazing resturant & bar. The atmosphere was great, views were spectacular as an added bonus the the feel of theresturant. The service was immaculate no complaits! no only was the service courtious but polite and helpful. Food was spot on, sharp with a full taste, meat was cooked exactly how i like, succulent. Price could come down but other wise nothing bad to say on an excellent resturant.",4
"We had dinner at Galvin at Windows in London to celebrate my birthday. The evening was wonderful. The views from the 28th floor restaurant are stunning. The staff were extremely attentive and the food very yummy indeed! Portion sizes looked small but i struggled to get through the main course...I still managed dessert, the chocolates and the marshmallows though! Overall a really lovely dinner.",4
"Lunch at Galvin at Windows with its 28th floor views of Hyde Park starts with the potential to be memorable.  It is already an unique London venue, and they try hard to please.  The three course lunch for ¬£27.50 is very reasonable, and whilst the portions are modest, the quality is high.  Recommended.",3
"Malmaison Brasserie, Manchester is a great place to eat in the City. Loved the ambience of the place and the food, each course, was pretty much perfect. The service was also really intuitive. The staff all paid attention to you and were warm and friendly, making sure you got exactly what you wanted. I'd definitely reccomend this place to anyone.",4
Went to Galvin @ Windows for a birthday celebration.  I can find no fault in this place.  All the staff were friendly and polite all were very knowledgeable and happy to answer any questions.  The food was outstanding.  I had Lamb to start my partner had a risotto (both were cooked beautifully).  Main was fantastic and the creme brule was just the best I have ever eaten and I have been to many Michelen starred restaurants.  I will be going back and I would highly recommend it.,4
"Great Service, fantastic setting, good for special occasions but a little on the expensive side..  our meal for two inclusive of champagne and wines came to over ¬£450, but its fair to say that we would go back again and find a reason to soon!",4
"Wonderful views but small portions  - I had to eat lots of peanuts to fill me up .

Great cocktails",3
"Malmaison. Standard resturant, good food, good service. Good value for money at lunch. Would recommend.",3
"Galvin at Windows
London Hilton, 22 Park Lane, London, W1K 1BE.
Fantastic panoramic views over London. Attentive staff. Not cheap.....even using the set menu offer........BUT seeing London light up as the sun set, worth every penny.",3
Nothing outstanding at Galvin. I prefer Orrery for the same deal price of ¬£35 or better yet the Greenhouse,2
"After a very prolonged journey caused by the closure of UK airports it was a delight to be welcomed at the London Hilton, enjoy champagne in the Bar and then dine in Galvin.",3
It's worth visit Galvin at Windows for the great views of london.,3
Enjoyed a stunning view of London from Galvin at Windows atop the London Hilton in wonderful tranquility whilst savouring a delicious lunch.  The service was attentive but not intrusive.  Thoroughly recommend this.,4
"As usual a very enjoyable experience, the food was very good, however the menu for the 3 courses for ¬£27.00 had not changed at all since the last time i had been on 19th March, however the price had that had increased to ¬£27 instead of ¬£25, it would of been nice to have a different menu choice aswell.",4
"Fantastic time at Galvin, food was excellent and so was service.  The views across London are amazing.

Definately recommend.",4
"Galvin at Windows was wonderful - the service, the view, the food and the wine were all outstanding! We definately have plans on going back! The tables in the middle of the room didn't quite have the same wonderful view but then again I am short! And we both felt at times the room was crowded (loads of staff floating around) but I guess that's what happens if you want good service.",4
"Wonderful setting for my nephews birthday. A great venue if you are a bit of a showy person, brush up on your London geography to spot the buildings! fairly formal but the staff are very helpful and polite. Tables are large and chairs comfortable. The food is very good and I would recommend the venison. Not cheap once the wine is added but if you are sensible then this is a great example of London dining.",3
"Absolutely fantastic - amazing service, great food, good value for such high quality. And a stunning view. Definitely one not to miss.",4
"I had taken my friend who was over from Australia.
  I had been before,the food and the service is first class.

  Really Recomend",4
"Malmaison Brasserie - Manchester. Good food, atmosphere and service as usual.",3
"Divine food, and impeccable service, Galvins never disappoints!",4
"We went for a late Sunday lunch on a nice, sunny Spring afternoon and enjoyed the fabulous views over London and, in particular, Buckingham Palace gardens.  We took the 3 course for ¬£25 option and enjoyed all the food, albeit the dessert stood out as being by far the best - marscapone and blood orange cheesecake; absolutely delicious!! Enjoy!!",3
Another outstanding meal at Galvin at Windows; cannot fault any element of the experience,4
"I have visited this restaurant a number of times and as always the food service and surroundings are excellent, i look forward to visiting again already.  I would definatley recommend it to others.",4
"This was our first visit to Galvin at Windows and we will definitely return. The food, the service, the location were all first class. We visited on a Friday lunchtime and the ambience of the restaurant was perfect.The lunchtime menu at ¬£39.50 for 3 courses including 1/2 bottle of wine,water and coffee represented excellent value.",4
I went to Galvin at Windows for dinner with my boyfriend! The view there was stunning. The service was great. We ordered a 3 courses meal for 35 pounds and it was pretty good!,4
"The toptable offer is a fantastic opportunity to get the Galvin experience without spending too much money. I've been there a few times already and always loved it. The view is amazing, the food is very good (it's not too filling though, eat well at lunch if you go there for dinner ;-) )  and the service is definitely a top-class one.
If you get a drink and include the service in your total bill, you will spend ¬£50 per person ish.",3
Galvin at Windows - simply fantastic in every respect. Couldn't recommend it more highly.,4
"Set on the top floor of the London Hilton at Park Lane, I decided to take my girlfriend to Galvin at Windows for our first romantic dinner in London. The views were stunning, giving a panoramic view of central London. We ordered the 3 course set menu which was well presented and delicious. The highlight being the pork belly which was juicy and succulent. We were also treated with a palette cleanser, a pumpkin veloute which was delicious as well as a nice jar of marshmellows. Recommended!",4
Food was very good and the views were stunning...Small portions,4
"Galvin at Windows on Park Lane in London was an excellent venue for lunch when my parents were in town. Not only was the view spectacular, but the service, staff and food were all excellent. Presentation was impeccable and everything we ordered was cooked to perfection. My only complaint was that it was very hot in there as I was sitting directly in the sunshine.",3
"A classy location with impressive views over Hyde Park and West London. The restaurant itself is nicely laid out with simple, elegant decor and lots of space between the tables. The service overall was very good - polite, friendly and attentive. Possibly slightly too attentive at times, almost omnipresent, but par for the course for this level of dining. Food-wise, superb with possibly one of the best deserts I`ve ever had - the chocolate palet with caramelised banana - phenominal.",3
"Recently enjoyed lunch at Galvin on Park Lane. Understandably, the restaurant had a high proportion of corporate clientele on a Friday lunch time, however - the atmosphere was very relaxed and the staff attentive and knowledgable. 

We both opted for the set menu, which represents very good value. There was limited choice (3 choices per course) but there was something to cater for all and the food was excellent in both presentation and taste. 

Great views and would highly recommend!",4
"Aweseome location and venue, high standard with staff being fully accomodating.  Food was average/below, not worth the high prices.  For such prices you would expect the complete package for a dinning experience - one which you do not get here.  Food was the weakest link.. unimaginative!",1
"As usaul Galvin at Windows not only offers spectular views, but also food and service comes with high standards. Perfect for business (except the distraction of seeing London from the top of the world).",3
"Very nice, great views but very expensive.",3
"Impeccable service, extremely impressive food and great views. Atmosphere was a little business like, would be good venue for business lunch.",3
Atmosphere and food good....one diner with us was disappointed with the cheese on toast and was expecting something a little more exciting but everything else was great. Stuffed first on bread and tapenade so struggled to finish the portions. It would be good to see a change on the menu for March though hopefully as I go so often. Would recommend.,4
Another fantastic meal by Malmaison. The 3 tenners deal never fails to disappoint and the Onglet was cooked to perfection. All diners enjoyed the meal but the only comment would be that the fish cake definately needed a side order as was a little on the small side. Would definately recommend though...love it!,4
"The Galvin restaurant in the Hilton hotel, Park lane, London. Suitably impressive. Marble everywhere, even in the lift which zipped us up 28 floors very quickly.

Dimly lit interior. Lots of staff hovering all the time. Comfortable, warm surroundings. I had asked for a table by the window and was delighted when we were seated next to one with a fabulous view over south London at night.
 
Food was French (I suppose) with lots of ""Possets"" ""Crevettes"" and ""Tranches"" in the menu. Very tasty.",3
"Excellent food, top class service, excellent lunch menu and a graet way to spend a Sunday afternoon. would highly recommend.",4
Galvin at Windows offers lovely food with a great view over central London. The staff are very friendly and attentive. Will visit again...,3
Great value and spectacular views!,3
Wonderful meal overlooking the lights of London. Impeccable service and food from set menu was very good; beautiful bread and amuse bouche to start. My partner's pork main was the winner and my cheese plate delighted us both.,4
This was an experience - recommended!,3
"we were on an outing for my partners birthday with another couple.
we asked earlier for a window table and were pleased to see we got one for the views over London.Although we were on a 3 course ¬£33 ticket we had a lovely meal with some nice touches esp an extra course and some birthday chocs.
Only negative was the most expensive G and T at ¬£12.....and I thought the Boxwood at ¬£9 was dear. A few cocktails at Trader Vics in the basement also helped.",3
We had the 3 courses for 33 pounds offer and it was well worth it. The views over London were superb and the service was amongst the best we have experienced. A small comment on the Top Table booking that it was our anniversary had resulted in the restaurant presenting us with an anniversary plate of petit fours - a really appreciated touch! We would heartily recommend the restaurant to any one.,4
"Great view and great value and great food all for ¬£33.
Watch out for the drinks as this can double your spend. Having said that we had a wonderful time and the service was excellent.  
Worth a trip for the Pigs cheeks alone. Outstanding.",4
We checked out Galvin at Windows for our first anniversary and found it to be a great experience. A little pricy at the bar but the food was great.,3
Windows was excellent on all levels,4
"Wonderful food, service and location - it was just the perfect venue for a mid-week lunch with a friend.
However the male and female toilets were 'out of order' on 28th floor the day we visited - we needed to use the toilets on the ground floor! Would not have been the day to go if you had poor bladder control!!",4
"Love love love the Mal. It helps that it's round the corner from where I live but the food was really great this visit. Had the onglet again which was very tender and a lovely ceaser salad to start. The value is great even though we upgraded our wine this time as they dont offer a rose on the 3 tenners offer...maybe something to consider Mal?
Service was friendly although sometimes it takes a while to get noticed when asking for water/ice/condiments etc...
Highly recommend :-)",4
"This place never disappoints me! I took colleagues from overseas offices yesterday and they keep repeated that they had the best time ever. 
The staff was really kind and readily moved us to a table closer to the window. The food as usual was amazing in the way it looked and the way it tasted!
I would never stop recommending this restaurant!",4
"You'll love Galvin at Windows,would definately recommend.The staff are very attentive and the food lovely.The views make this very special.Good for a romantic setting.We went to the bar beforehand and had a couple of cocktails,then seated. We opted for the deal ¬£33 for 3 courses,we weren't dissappointed. We'll be back to sample the whole menu .We went for our anniversary and as a lovely gesture they brought out some chocolates with happy anniversary written on the plate.We weren't rushed at all.",4
"We went to Malmaison Brasserie in Manchester for lunch. I had been to the restaurant in London, and this lived up to my high expectations. The food was delicious (amazing bread!) Service was great and it was a lovely setting, making for a very memorable meal. I would definitely recommend it for people looking for a good French Brasserie in Manchester with a sophisticated atmosphere.",4
"fantastic all round, we had the set lunch menu which was amazing value at ¬£39.50 incl wine and coffee, and the food was superb. The restaurant is stunning and the service impeccable. Highly recommend.",4
"We booked Galvin at Windows at Park Lane in London for Sunday lunch, we were very disappointed that a roast meal was not on the menu. Staff very attentive, food average but the view over London great. 

We would return, but not in a hurry. Price per head around ¬£40 with drinks.",2
"A very nice lunch with a wonderful view. Staff very attentive from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.
Will definitely be making another visit.",4
"As always Malmaison delivered on good, well presented food. The Three Tenners menu was varied with lots of choice and the wine with the deal was enjoyable.
Service was fine albeit a little slow to clear the table after we had finished. There was also no checkback. 
Would definately recommend
Thanks",3
Confident well balanced cooking in contemporary surroundings atop the 28th floor of the Park Lane Hilton with commanding panoramic views thrown in for free. Service friendly and efficient.The inclusive lunch menu represents excellent value.,3
Excellent. Food was amazing and service impeccable.  Highly recommended.,4
"Superb food, great service nice view at Galvin at Windows. Avoid champagne if on a budget.",3
"Arrived for 6.30 booking into empty restaurant but given window table with brilliant view! Excellent service, had the TT ¬£33 for 3 course offer - good value. Hot chocolate fondant to die for! Very nice evening for a special occasion.",4
"I took my husband here for his birthday last night, as I wanted to treat him to some fine dining and something special.  Being an absolute foodie - he loved it and said it was the best meal he'd ever had!

The service was excellent and we were very well looked after and everyone was very friendly and helpful.  A lovely place for a special occasion that everyone would enjoy.",4
"The view was spectacular, the service was very attentive and the meal was fantastic. All in all it made for a wonderful evening",4
"Although it was a foggy day, view was stil amazing. Food was devinde and service exceptional.",4
"great food, amazing view and excellent service. the top table offers make this restaurant affordable.",4
"We had the ""La Carte"" menu at ¬£33 a head and had a thoroughly enjoyable meal. I have certainly had poorer meals at restaurants boasting Michelin stars.
The service was attentive yet unobtrusive and of course you get the added benefit of a birds eye view of central London.
We would definitely go back.",4
Galvin at Windows. Amazing setting with lovely food. Staff a little pretentious in the fact that we were not allowed to stay for drinks in the separate bar afterwards as they did not believe we had eaten in the restaurant. Also seemed a little put out when we asked them to take a photo. Food and service of food were very good though and we were allocated a window seat which we'd requested.,3
Best view in London and excellent food.,4
Incredible views and impeccable service really set the tone for Galvin. The food was good value with the top table deal. That said you can still rack up a big bill with a few extras. Galvin is a good event place and I‚Äôm sure I will return.,4
"We were incredibly impressed with Galvin at Windows - the service and food were amazing and their 3 courses for ¬£33 was incredible value. My team work in customer service and are incredibly picky about it, but we couldn't fault the staff. They made the evening wonderful.  We were right by a window as requested and the views were breathtaking - we could even see Selfridges chrismas lights!",4
We had a lovely lunch at Galvin at windows. Food was superb and the service was very good but just a little intrusive.,4
"Firstly, the views from Galvin at Windows are amazing. Set high on the 28th floor, all tables have a panoramic view. The food was divine and presented beautifully. Would definitely return!",4
"Galvin at windows, very posh but very nice!",4
"Enjoyed our meal at Galvins at Windows; had a lovely table overlooking Buckingham Palace. Chose the ¬£39.50  table d'hote which was excellent value. However no bonne bouches as last time and petit fours were only supplied after coffee was served, when requested. Menu was well balanced and perfectly cooked
especially the sea bass.",3
Decent but not great.,2
"I took my parents to Galvin at Windows for sunday lunch. We had their 3 course set menu for ¬£25 which was delicious though rather limited in choice.
We have eaten here before and the food and service are consistently good, with great views.",4
Monday night and wasn't expecting it to be so packed with a great atmosphere such a bonus!  Been here several times due to superb friendly and efficient service with a smile serving great food.  It is also great to continue the evening in the bar with an after dinner drink !,4
Excellent food and good service despite busy lunch period.  Good offer - additions for drinks/coffee/service increased final bill to twice the price.  Views were amazing and still a special experience. Ask for window table when book.,3
"Really good service, incredible setting, useful range of prices on wine list.  Food was very good, though ¬£33 menu is very limited (three choices for each of the three courses).  Certainly nowhere near as varied as the regular a la carte (at ¬£58).",4
Amazing food and service highly recommend I was celebrating my birthday and thanks to the staff it was truely a day to remember!!!!,4
"Marvellous! A superb meal, the atmosphere was great, the staff very attentive and overall a very enjoyable evening (with excellent views from the bar and restaurant). Will definitely be recommending to friends.",4
"Went there for lunch, staff attentive, food was a good standard nothing out of this world but good qulaity.  Would deffinatly go again.",3
Very pleasant evening with  beautiful views across London. Food was very good and the wines good but pricey. Liked it a lot and will go back agan for another special occassion.,3
"Had a lovely meal at Galvins. The service was great and friendly and the TT deal was good value. We still got the nice add ons - shot of soup, bread and chocolates etc. Would have been great to have had a table closer to teh window. Going on a wednesday meant it was quite corporate/business meetings, but still a lovely evening.",3
"I had lunch before here and had a good memories with the perfect view of the park in front. The waiters were polite with humour served us at the time. However, I was rather disappointed with them this time. I asked window with the park view which was not provided first. I think it was more of the services ( they just brought us menues we ordered and that was it....table was full of bread crumbles which we cleaned ourselves.) To this point, the service charges of 13% is high. Food was still good.",3
"The location is probably one of the best in London, the views are spectacular.

The food and service was extremely good. We found the waiters and staff friendly and helpful as well as extremely efficient.

Unfortunately we only had time for one course. My husband had pheasant which was well cooked and which he enjoyed greatly. I had the John Dory which was really well cooked and came with a curried oil which compemented the dish. On the down side we thought the portions were small.",2
"London- Galvins at Windows
The menu choice compared to the two previous lunch visits, was not as enticing and therefore didn't seem to be as enjoyable. (the wood pigeon for my main course may have simply been the wrong choice, it was cooked perfectly however the dish lacked another flavour of some kind) However the standard of food and service is exceptional and we thoroughly enjoyed the evening.",4
Galvin at Windows is in fact 28th floor restaurant in Park Lane Hilton.  The meal was superb. The only minor comment might be that although we were told we could have the table for 2 hours - and it was booked at 12pm- we were rather hurried through our coffee and indeed out into the bar to have the coffee at around 1.15pm. Great value for money with the 25¬£ set lunch though it would have been possible to pay around ¬£100 each with the other menus.,3
Excellent!,3
Galvin at Windows is a beautiful venue for lunch with fantastic views and excellent service. The set lunch was very good value for such high quality food and the wines offered in the package very good.,4
Perfect for a sunday lunch with a view,3
Galvin at Windows served up amazing food and attentive service. Absolutely no complaints (which is rare for me!),4
"I took my girlfriend to Galvin at Windows, booking in the morning for the 8:30pm sitting that day.

 The starters look tiny when they arrive, but they are absolutely delicious and surprisingly filling. The mains were nice, but maybe a little less adventurous. When we ordered dessert, they had run out of one of the 2 choices, and offered a plain creme brulee alternative. 

A nice evening over all - maybe a little expensive compared to alternatives I've been to before at the same standard.",3
"Had a super lunch with my twin sister at Galvin at Windows, London Hilton. It was the first time for my sis although I have been many times. As always it didn't disappoint. Excellent service, quality food and a reasonable price made it a memorable occasion. Well done Galvins for consistency!",4
"Galvin at the London Hilton on Park Lane.   Fabulous food, attentive but never intrusive service, lovely wine, beautiful view across London.  We would definitely go again - we were both very impressed.",4
"Malmaison - Manchester
This was much better than I had expected. The food was excellent. Service was attentive yet not intrusive. Will visit again soon.",4

"Amazing view at Galvin at Windows, attentive and friendly service and lovely food - all felt very special.  Still a bit hotel like, but all in all a very lovely meal.",4
Galvin at Windows - brilliant views and excellent service. Not a huge choice with the ¬£33 menu but the food we ordered was good.,3
"I had my birthday celebration meal at Galvin at Windows, London last year and it was so wonderful that I decided to go back this year. It wasn't as good. The service was patchy but very polite when we got some. We ordered coffees with pudding and whilst pudding came reasonably quickly, half an hour later our drinks still hadn't arrived so we cancelled and asked for the bill because everything had taken so long we were ready to leave. it's still a really nice place and the food is excellent tho.",3
"The view from the top floor of the Hiltopn makes for a great experience, especially if you are lucky enough to get a table near the windows.  The food was good, if not exceptional, however, the small menu was broad enough to please our party of four.

The toptable deal was good value and we had two very reasonable prices of nice wine (¬£25 a bottle), however, once we added on the price of a couple of G&Ts the bill soon got up to about ¬£80 per person (¬£10.50 per G&T).",3
"The service and food was good, and the view magnificent, but they didn't know anything about the special offer of 3 courses and a glass of champagne for ¬£25, so we had to take their regular lunch at ¬£39. Not very impressed.",2
"My second visit to Galvin's for lunch and they did not disappoint - food was excellent and beautifully presented. The offer was not as good as the first time, which included champagne and coffee for the same price, but nonetheless I would definitely recommend for a special lunchtime treat.",4
The service is very good. But the duck breast I ordered is not so good,3
The restuarant and service were very good. The food wsa slightly mixed in terms of quality. The butternut squash risotto was very runny and not as full of flavour as it should have been. The sea bream was good but the bed of beans lacked flavour too. The liqorice pannacotta did not have any liqorice flavour - but was pleasant. The finishing touches of hand made chocolates and marshmallows with the coffee was lovely.,3
"Galvin at Windows, London Hilton - excellent ambience, expensive wine list, great food, views over London at night made it worthwhile, staff friendly",3
"Very tasty food, friendly service and a great atmosphere. Extensive and good value wine selection.",3
Galvins at Windows - Hilton Hotel - Park Lane London,3
"We had lunch at Galvin at Windows on Sunday 4th October. A good welcome although we were not given a wndow table as had been requested but they did move us when one became available.
Great food, wonderful service and tremendous views over London. The drinks were a little expensive but a memorable day.",4
"As always very good service embiqnce and food, and very good recommendation by the sommelier.",4
"I went to Galvin at Windows in Park Laen and could not have been more impresses - gorgeous ambience, much better than the photo, special service, amazing virews and very good food - perfect for a birthday or similar! be careful on the dirnks prices though, wine started at about ¬£40 a bottle however they werent fussed about giving out tap water so the cheaper option is there if needed!",4
"Malmaison's Brasserie in Piccadilly, Manchester has a very warm, welcoming atmosphere.  Service was attentive but not overbearing.  My guests and I had the Sunday roast, and both the beef and pork were cooked to perfection.  The location is brilliant - across the road from Piccadilly train station - so ideal if you're about to wave someone off!",3
"Sunday Lunch at Malmaison Manchester well up to usual standard. Four of us enjoyed the mushroom soup and the roasts, my wife had an excellent risotto.Looking forward to another visit in November",4
We went to Galvin at Windows for a special occasion and the atmosphere and food were just right,4
"had a fantastic lunch here. the food was excellent, the staff very attentive and the toptable deal was good value. would recommend this restaurant and would definitely go back again.",4
"Galvin at Windows provided some impressive food in a location that enjoys a simply great view of London. The food was well presented and full of interesting flavours that worked well together.  Throughtout the meal the service was attentive and discrete.  The food and the service merit a visit, the view makes it a 'must go'.",3
This is the second time I have been to Galvin at Windows for lunch and the food and service was just as excellent this time as the first. The views over London are fanstatic as ever. Definitely recommend this restaurant.,4
"We had a wonderful evening, from the moment we arrived. We had a lovely table, excellent service and food, the maitre d. was so nice and took us to see the view of the Thames from the other side of the building. We were made to feel special.",4
"Malmaison Manchester was full for the Sunday lunch special and the tables in the Brasserie are a bit close together. Intimate and intimidating by turns and they were certainly turning tables.The offer is very good value. Service excellent, odd shaped forks repaced with graspable ones on request. Sometimes form overcomes function. Choice of wines, we had Cab/merlot, good with food. My pork was as tasty as I've had and perfect crackling. Ann's beef not so good.I've just had better at Wetherspoons.",3
"Excellent.  Really helpful and friendly staff, and the food was amazing.  If anyone is wondering whether to go:  book now.  Stunning views from the 28th floor of the Hilton accross London.",4
"Excellent food, spectacular views, friendly and accommodating staff.  Would definitely go again.",4
"An absolutely awesome view and it is a must to book a balcony seating to take in all the benefits. 
The set menu was just delicious partnered with fantastic service. It is a must.",4
"I took my wife to windows for a birthday treat, although we could only book an early seating we did get to see the sunset over hyde park with our starters. 

From the palette cleansing tomato jelly to the chocolate truffles everything was spot on. We'd definitely recommend the waiters recommendation of the strawberry dessert with a glass of champagne milkshake, it was the business!Attentive and friendly service as one would expect! 
The ¬£33 menu was a bargain",4
"Galvin at Windows (Park Lane, London). Had lunch with a friend (¬£25 for 3 courses, including glass of Champagne and coffee - good value).  Food good for a set menu.",3
This was a nice experience but there was a mixup for post-lunch coffee - we were invited to the bar by one member of staff and then told we had a (just) under 18 year old so we had to turn round again. The staff dealt well enough with it. We were given coffee in a little alcove area. The restuarant is in a superb location re the views. The food was great.,3
"A total and utter bargain. Fabulous lunch, excellent combinations. E.G. Haddock croutons in Sweetcorn soup a triumph, and not something I'd ordinarily order. Salmon cooked to perfection and beautiful duck main courses. Puddings again wonderful - the lemon posset in particular I cannot rate highly enough.

Bargain of bargains the meal price included not only champagne - but our choice of coffee and seemingly endless petit fours. I do reccommend the rasberry jellies. We will be back again soon.",4
"Brilliant food, brilliant service, brilliant view. It's not cheap but you certainly get what you pay for. Brilliant all round.",4
"Food was amazing and the service was fantastic.  Attentic but not over the top.
The offer was fantastic value for money.  Would definately recommend.  We went during the day so the views were brilliant although for that romantic meal London by night is probably better.",4
"Dinner at Galvin at Windows in the Hilton Hotel Park Lane is the ideal setting for celebrating a special occasion. The views from the Penthouse restaurant over London are superb, the staff are courteous and attentive and the food is excellent. In addition it is very good value for money.",4
Malmaison Brasserie in manchester was dark and mysterious in decor.  The food was a reasonable standard for the price and service was attentive and friendly. The toilets were clean and had amusing comedy sketches playing in the background...,3
"Sunday lunch at Malmaison Brasserie was pretty good. The mushroom soup starter was extremely tasty, although the roast beef was not so tender. The setting is very pleasant, though and I would return.",3
Galvin at windows - the view was fantastic and great service; they brought some toys and colourings for my daughters which were very useful. The food was delicious and the top table offer was great value for money. would definitely go back again.,4
Galvins @ windows Park Lane Hilton was great. Food excellent and staff very welcoming. Will go again soon,4
"Choice of 2 starters, mains and desserts.  Excellent service and delicious chocolates served with coffee.  food of very high standard, but smallish servings.  Having said that I didn't leave hungry!",4
"We went to Galvin at Windows for a romantic dinner. Very nice restaurant with a spectacular view, excellent food and very attentive staff. Especially appreciated all the nice little extras, like the amuse-gueule as well as the chocolate and marshmallows offered for coffee. Hope to return soon.",4
This is the only place where you can eat over-the-top food against magnificent London views.Perfect!,4
"What a great place.  The service was fantastic and the TT special offer for 3 courses was just right.  The duck main course was out of this world but the best was the sweetcorn soup which just amazed me especially with the popcorn!
The only slightly negative was the bread that cost ¬£4.00 a go!!
Would definatly go back but maybe next time with hubby for a nice romantic night!",4
"Just perfect ! Had the TT ¬£30, 3 course lunch with coffee and champagne, overlooking Buckingham Palace back yard, If you are looking for a special place with great views, to impress others or just self-indulge, then, this is it. The staff are lovely, very french and professional. The food is a finely balanced creation of flavours which just work in perfect harmony, no matter what you choose. Just go. We paid ¬£72 for 2, with water and wine and service added but feel it was well worth it.",4
"Galvin at Windows, London
My husband and I chose this Restaurant having read a number of reviews and to enjoy the stunning views over London. We chose 7.30pm so we could see both the sunset and night views and were not disappointed!
The Food was superb, we chose from the ¬£33 3 course menu. There was plenty to chose from and each dish was presented well and tasted amazing. The Service was exemplory and made our 24th anniversary a night to remember. The wine list was extensive, a good selection.",4
"Galvin @ Windows was superb as ever; top drawer food and drink, the best service in town and views that never get dull. The Sunday lunch deal is super value, looking at the bar prices I reckon the champagne and coffee alone would cost as much as the ¬£25-for-three-courses deal that included them.",4
"Sunday lunch at Galvin at Windows, London was an inspired choice. Immense view over London on the sunniest day of the year, food was delicious and elegantly prepared - brilliant value at ¬£25 for 3 courses, champagne and coffee. Staff friendly, although perhaps a little over attentive; sommelier pushed the wine too. Overall beats a Sunday fry up and reading the papers any day. 
Go, enjoy and live up that 'I'm on holiday even though I'm in London' feeling.",4

We both had duck for the main course which was unusual but very tasty. I chose a strawberry vacherin which was delicious and my daughter had a chocolate ganache dessert which was lovey. We finished off with coffee and chocolates. The view really made the night special,4

We reserved the intimate private room for a friend's surprise 40th, we even used Malmaison's excellent 2000 and Wine offer which I hope will be around for some time to come.

It may knock a hole in your wallet, but for the special occasion of our anniverary it was an evening to remember and cherish. The service was attentive without being overbearing.

One of our party has a severe nut allergy, which all staff were aware of & were able to advise on the menu accordingly. We were seated by a window & enjoyed a very special meal in very special surroundings.

Galvin at Windows - great venue. Very attentive staff but not in an uncomfortable way because they were so nice. Food was delicious - we had a special set menu with few options but they all looked good. Overheard another table ask for a number of changes to a main course and all requests were graciously accommodated. Drinks and service added another 50% to the final bill but the set menu was such good value we didn't mind. Thoroughly recommend it.,4

Wondeful meal. The Toptable deal of 3 courses and a glass of champagne was outstanding value. Delicious selection on the set menu and all portions were quite generous! Service was very attentive and they even allowed us a desert off the set-menu as we were too full from the previous courses to consider the more decadent choices. We will be back!,4
"My husband, daughter (age 6) & I had lunch at Galvins Windows  having booked a ¬£25 3 course lunch special through toptable. The location is wonderful, table with view of Hyde Park.

The food was great - the panacotta excellent and cheese selection, superb. All in all, a wonderful experience for all of us.",4
Atmosphere was lovely. Great value for money. Service was exceptional.,4
"We had the fixed price champagne lunch at Galvins at Windows on the 28th floor of Park Lane Hilton and it was excellent.  I started with the pigs head ballotine and my friend had the asparagus.  Both beautifully presented and cooked to perfection.  Mains and puddings were a delight to behold and tasted just as good. Service was like theatre, beautifully executed and discrete at the same time.  And the view was amazing too.  What more could I ask for my birthday treat?",4
"We went for lunch at Galvin on a lovely sunny day using the toptable offer (3 courses, a glass of champagne and coffee for ¬£25).

I will definitely return.",4
"The spectacular views over London and the excellent service are definitely the main attractions of Galvin at Windows restaurant.  The food experience was mixed; we both really enjoyed our starters, but were not so taken with the main courses.  Deserts were great though.  Would have been good value with one of the offers, at full central London prices though it feels quite steep.  Well worth having a drink in the bar which also enjoys great views over the city.",3
Good setting and enjoyable experience.  the Local Menu was reasonably priced for 3 courses. House wine was also excellent for the price. Went with a group of 10 and would defintiely recommend.,3
Galvins at windows TT offer is very good value for money sevice was excellent good atmosphere very busy without being noisy would recommend,4
I love Mal Manchester - my favourite of all their hotels and restaurants.,4

The views are incredible and our waiter even took us through the kitchen to see the even more spectacular view from the staff balcony.

We had the set menu for ¬£25 which included a glass of champagne, excellent value for money.
We now want to go back to experience the view at night time!",4

Booked Galvin at Windows in London for a celebration meal on toptables offer.  Food was beautiful & the view was amazing!  Staff were attentive and welcoming.,4
"Galvin at Windows offers stunning views and delicious food which make this a good choice for a special and expensive meal. This time, the beef eaters were a bit underwhelmed with their meal- too much meat and not enough vegetables. We fish  and pork eaters were delighted with our tasty dishes. The tarte tatin is to die for- it provides enough for 4 not 2 - so be warned!",3
"Food was excellent. Service was outstanding as well as the waiters being extremely friendly.
Well worth a trip just to see the view of London from the 24th floor.
Try some of the cocktails, pricey but very tasty!",4
"I went with high expections and was not disappointed. There were 7 of us in the booking, all doing the ¬£33 3-course dinner. We had a table right next to the window overlooking Hyde park - the view was amazing. The service was excellent, drinks were served promptly and topped up intermittently. I had the salmon for entree, sea bass for main and the chocolate dessert. Portion sizes were ample. This was more than just a nice dinner; it was a great experience and highly recommended.",4
"Great Service & Ambience , definitely worth the money (Toptable Offer).",4

"Absolutely brilliant.
Astounding views, great food and understated but attentive service. Couldn't fault it 10 out of 10",4

"Excellent food. However, limited menu. The lovely view made it a great treat.",3
"Had a thoroughly enjoyable lunch at Galvin's. Lovely surroundings, however more businesslike than I expected. Very good value and an interesting menu including unusual meats and fish. Unfortunately the bill took over half an hour to arrive once we had asked for it, such a shame at a lovely restaurant.",3
"I took my partner for his birthday to Galvins at Windows and we had an amazing evening. The staff were very attentive and friendly.  The food was absolutely amazing and the presentation of each course was flawless.  At the end of the meal my partner was presented with a plate of home made chocolates with 'happy birthday' piped around the edge of the plate, which was a very nice gesture at the end of a wonderful meal.

I would defiantly recommend this restaurant and hope to go again soon!",4
"Galvin at Windows London.
fantastic location and beautiful place.  food surprising and delicious.  staff a bit snotty at times, and keen to upsell wine.
toilets disappointing.
but all in all would go again for the whole experience.",3
Galvin at Windows.  My husband and I enjoyed a wonderful lunch having the set menu option of 3 courses plus a glass of champagne.  It was good value for money.  The service was excellent.  I would recommend this experience.,4
"With several menus to choose from the choice was immense, as was the accompanying wine list! The service was very attentive bordering on intrusive at times however. I had my dessert taken away despite not asking had I finished (I assume as we had only 20 mins of our allocated 2 hour slot remaining). The air conditioning was a little severe for the time of year and had to retrieve our scarves from the cloak room in order to keep warm! The restaurant is a nice venue which certainly would impress.",3
"Galvins at Windows in Park Lane was a great place to take my partner for her birthday. The food was excellent, with very attentive staff. Great ambience and the view of London made it all the more worthwhile. Will definately return again.",4
Malmaison Manchester is a busy venue. the food was acceptable with some portions large and others quite average. the service was good. i would go again but it was nothing exceptional so would not necessarily make this the first choice,2
"A great place to eat with obvious fantastic views. We booked our table for 5.00 which worked out well as the sun was setting whilst having our meal. The service is of the highest standard and the waiters are very pleasant and not pompous, which helps if your not much of a foodie! There was only two dishes to choose from off each course but for ¬£19.50 for 3 courses you cant expect everything! Food and presentation were fantastic too.",4
"I booked a table for two with the special offer at Galvin at Windows in the Hilton, we have been there before but this time was the most enjoyable from start to finish, the only embarissing thing of the evening was getting a bill for the full amount without the discount, when i called the waiter to point it out my friend thought i was causing a fuss which i didn't need as the evening had been so good until then, we couldn't fault the food, the wine was pricy but worth every sip, i highly recomme",3
Great restaurant for a special occasion as the views are fantastic.  Our starters were excuisite and the rest of the food was very good although I was disapointed with the steak which wasn't anything special at all despite being an extra cost on top of the standard al la carte price.  Expect to pay ~¬£200 for two with wine.,3
"Beautifully old fashioned restaurant, perfect for a special meal. The view, food and service are all exceptional. When I say old fashioned I simply mean there are no gimmicks here. Galvin's is very well executed top class restaurant. It was my birthday and they made me feel very special, giving us a window seat and generally treating us very well. The food was excellent. The pork belly was amongst the best I've tasted.
Eye wateringly expensive but worth it for a special occasion.",3
"I booked a table at Galvin Windows to enjoy dinner with a friend that I haven't seen for five years.  I hoped it would  provide a special experience for us both and I am pleased to say that our dinner and the ambience was befitting of such an occasion. The views really are stunning and the restaurant has been decorated in a pleasingly modern and artisitic manner without being over the top.  The waiting staff were polite, the wine gorgeous and the food was a real treat.",4
"The food matches the high quality view at Galvin at Windows.  The main course of wild mushroom risotto was excellent, just a little bite in the rice.  Very good chocolate dessert.  Accompanied by good wine suggestions.",3
Galvin's at Windows: excellent food (set 3 course a la carte at ¬£58 each); wonderful setting with 360 view over London from the 28th floor restaurant; service very friendly and discreet.  Only complaint was the cost of a Campari & soda - ¬£11.50.,3
"We went to Galvin at Windows to celebrate our anniversary - and it could not have been more perfect.  Everything felt very romantic, and after the meal we were taken through the kitchens to see an extra special view across London which was an unexpected treat.  I have just been informed that I need to avoid dairy foods, and the staff were incredibly helpful in assisting me with this.  The food was - the staff were wonderful - and the whole experience one I would thoroughly recommend",4
"Galvin at Windows is one of our favourite restaurants in London.  The food is always excellent: every course is beautifully presented and is a perfect balance of flavour and texture with surprises in every dish.  The service is impeccable and the situation amazing too with views over London from every 28th floor window.  The 50% off food offer makes the meal very good value indeed at around ¬£50 per head for three courses from the a la carte, half a bottle of wine each, coffees and petits fours.",4
"Galvin at Windows was an excellent meal with stunning views over the city. We would certainly go back again.
Staff were very friendly and attentive. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening.",4

"Not so great for the vegetarians.  The waiter knew I was vegetarian yet still brought a fish canepe for me before dinner which I almost ate as it did not look like fish at all,",3
"I would highly recommend Galvins at Windows. The recent refurbishment has created a very stylish and contemporary setting with most tables being able to enjoy the wonderful views over London. We were most impressed with the food which apart from the superb presentation was a delight to the palette. Washed down with a perfect Chablis we left feeling very satisfied with our choice of venue and were delighted to have met Chris Galvin, on our way out, to compliment him!",4
"What a great spot for dinner! The views are truly stunning, and the service was some of the best I have had in London. Food was wonderful, but thought the choices were a little lite on. Staff were confused by the Toptable offer, with different opinions on which menu we were entitled to from different staff. In the end, it was sorted out smoothly. Excellent value with the 50% discount.",4
"We had the set menu and aperitif maison.  The choice was somewhat limited (one fish dish, one meat dish and one vegetarian for both the starter and the main course.  However, the food was suberb and the service could not be bettered.   We are tempted to go again at the full price.",4
"We went for an early dinner at Galvin at Windows at the Hilton, Park Lane. Food was very good - the sea bass main was excellent. Service was superb - timely and courteous, but non-intrusive. Setting, with a table looking south over St. James' Park and the Tate Modern, was beautiful. Ambience was quiet at first (as might be expected for an early dinner), but warmed up considerably through the evening.",3
"We had an excellent meal at Galvin at Windows on the 28th floor overlooking Buckingham Palace. The staff were friendly and the service couldn't be faulted. We participated in one of their special offers on the food but had Champagne and a good bottle of wine so had a very pleasant lunch. The halibut and slow cooked belly pork were delicious. The desserts were beautifully presented but the petits fours disappointing.
Also my two espressos were nearly ¬£10. However a lovely meal.",4
"An aperitif, a complementary hors d'oeuvre from the chef and 3 excellent courses, with superb service and the finest evening views in london all for ¬£35.   If there is a special offer out there to beat Galvin at Windows in the Park Lane Hilton, please let me know.",4
on the ¬£35 set menu deal. Still not cheap with a nice wine and service added. Lovely food - two dishes (chicken main and kedgeree starter) spectacularly good. Classy service. Moved us to a window table on request and with apparent pleasure. Great view. Lovely evening.,4
Excellent quality and service.  Unfortunately tables for two are not right by the window so view wasn't as good as expected.,3
"Booked Galvin at Windows for lunch for my wife's birthday. Was looking forward to the view and a decent lunch. The view lived up to expectation, but the food was much better than expected. The composition was very good with flavours complementing one another, but not in an obvious way, the presentation was excellent and the overall experience surpassed all expectations. Will definitely be returning.",4
"Great views from Galvin but up/down service. Only worth it with the 50% off deal. Although I had the offer, the meal still was north of ¬£100 for 2 as service/drinks do not recieve the offer. I am a part time waiter myself and I wasn't convinced by the service... it wasn't 5-star. The food was worth ¬£28 for 3 courses but not the full price (¬£58). The real strength were the main courses which were superb. I enjoyed the meal but wouldn't go again. It would be better to just go for sunset drinks.",3
galvin at windows was great in terms of venue and service. good value on offer.,3
"Malmaison Brasserie tries hard with low lighting etc, but the restaurant itself is very crowded, which seriously affects the ambience.  The food was very good if not fantastic but I would not particularly recommend it to any of my friends.",2
"Lovely venue with great views.  Very good food and service, definitely recommended.",4
galvin at windows is a lovely night out with amazing views. you are very looked aftwer there,4
We had a lovely evening with excellent food. It would have been nice to have a window seat however given that we had an early reservation albeit with the 50% offer.,4
Galvin at Windows is made by the view. The service and food come a very close second. My party was very impressed and the deal made it great value.,4
Fantastic - as always!,4
"Excellent food with an even better view of London.  Service was excellent but we were politely rushed to the table and encouraged to order because of the 2 hour turnaround (on the 50% off food offer).  However, completely left alone after the last course and cofees and ended up leaving at about 22:00 (after sitting down at 18:30).",4
"Galvin Windows, An amazing experience, Food and service was lovely but still quite expensive with the 50% off the food.  ¬£25 service charge. wow.",4
"I wanted to go to Galvin at Windows for ages and am glad we went but wouldn't recommend. We went for the a la carte but were treated as pre theatre, seated at 6.10 and out the door by 7.15. Not what we had expected at all. Service was friendly but over zealous. Food ok but nothing special. We were seated one table in from the views in a half empty restaurant but this is the real feature of the place and the views are stunning.",2
"Went to Galvin at windows for a late valentines evening, we have been a few times before and each time we go we are never disapointed! The restaurant, staff and food are always fantastic! would highly recommend visiting and especially when booking through top table and getting 50% off food!!",4
"Still quite expensive with wine and drinks. Views amazing, had window seat, Food very nice but quite small portions. Service excellent.",4
"Fantastic food, presentation was amazing and the taste was lovely",4
"Impeccable service, romantic ambience and fresh ingredients, that's how you would sum up Galvin at Windows. The service on its own makes the experience worthwhile and the quality and flavour of the food is simply indulgent. It's a bit pricey but totally worth it.",3
"Very romantic and nice view. 
Nice food and a good selection of wine.
Recommended highly.",4
"Had an amazing evening at Galvin at Windows on Mon the 9-th. Great food, lovely atmosphere, spot on service. What made it even more special was to see the Brazil national team arriving to the hotel just before our meal. Well done Galvin, well done Brazil.",4
"The lunch I had at Galvins at Windows was solidly good. Service professional, food well prepared and presented, nice and varied menu etc etc. But that is it. Professional. Well done job at work. No stars blinking in the sky. No memories lingering on the tongue. The views seduce. The price is high. High rating for value for many hinges on 50% off!",3
"Galvin at Windows was simply something to experience!Excellent risotto, service attentive, but not intrusive. From the cloakroom to the restaurant and out, trully enjoyable, as are the views!!! The choices for allergies was great, however, i would like to see more adventures deserts please. I 've had a wheat, yeast, sugar and dairy allergy for 6years, the menu's are getting better, thanks to the Chef's education, please work on the deserts. Thank you very much, we will be back.",4
"Galvin at Windows. Don't go for the view (the restaurant looks over the wrong part of London!), go for the superb food. And if they have the Tarte Tatin on the dessert menu - ORDER IT!",4
good food good serevice,4
"I chose Galvins because I wanted a special treat for a daughter who was just 21 and her elder brother, and I thought that food on the 28th floor would be a memorable experience. We had a really good time, the staff were incredibly nice, and we enjoyed the three course special although I was amazed at the smallness of the portions, and relieved when  my daughter, a hearty girl, said she was full.  Certanly had the wow factor.",4
"The restaurant was excellent as always.  I was a little disappointed to find that the tasting menu was not included in the Jan discount... the a la carte menu was very good anyways.  Service excellent, virgin drinks were spot on.  Try to sit away from the bar.",3
"Galvin at the Windows, excellent food, very pricey but with the 50% voucher, worth every penny!",4
"Took my parents in law and I wasn't let down. The service was great, the view incredible and the food really good. The price was pretty shocking, but the staff defintely earned their %.",3
"Galvins at Windows provided excellent food in a marvellous setting.  Sitting with South London at our feet, the attentive staff served up tremendous food in a formal but friendly way.  The set lunch with wine, water and coffee for ¬£45 is really good value.  The flavours and textures of every course made us think we were in food heaven.  And being on the 28th floor of the Hilton, we very nearly were!",4
"Galvin at windows, fabulous!!!! Try the duck for 2 ! or share the pear tart for 2!  enough for three all prepared at the table : great service. ambience abit tired but fabulous views. Pity that the bar is open to all crowded and although we asked for window table this was not offered in the bar or restaurant",4
"I booked Galvins for my girlfriends birthday and I was not disapointed.  The views are quite impresive (best if you are sitting right next to the window so recomending asking for one of those tables). We ordered the ""Menu Degutation"" which I would also recommend as it gives you a taste of what the restaurant can offer. The staff are very pleasant. and add to the experience. We spent ¬£270 for 2 Degutation meals with a bottle of champayne so have if you have the money or a special occasion go here",4
Galvins at Windows is a lovely restaurant. The service was excellent and the mood was great for a romantic evening. For me the quality of service by the waiters made it particularly memorable,3
"Fantastic food and ambience. We went for the ala carte menu. Appetisers - scallops (Decently sized and extremely tasty) and seared foie grae (definitely a must-try for foie grae lovers). Main course - catch of the day and beef (simple ingredients cooked to perfection, not overly elaborate and loved it!) We shared the pear tart for dessert which is MASSIVE but so good. All in all with 2 glasses of wine, the bill was 60 a head. Very reasonable and value for money.",4
"The food was flawless, the venue beautiful and the staff attentive - the only drawbacks were the amount of time it took for our starters to arrive - we'd been seated for over an hour - and the relentless topping up of wine after each sip but hey, they're niggles. And the food was doubtlessly worth the wait.",3
Gavins at Window is a lovely resturant. The food is excellent and the service is top quality. It is good for some special occasion.,4
"The Malmaison Brasserie has a regular specially priced menu with a varied selection of 'locally sourced' starters, mains and desserts - it's excellent value for money.  The chicken liver pate was smooth and creamy, and I thoroughly enjoyed my leg of chicken.  Great ambience - all dark and moody - and a good place for dates or small groups!",4
"Galvin @ Windows. We had dinner early evening on Saturday. Excellent service, food was on par with expectations, decor was modern deco, and the views over london are hard to match. Very good value.",4
second time here. was delicous again although I did enjoy the food more the first time I went there. But with the 50% offer we were delighted,4
"Galvin at Windows was the perfect spot to take my girlfriend before she embarked on an overseas trip. The breathtaking views, quiet competence of the service and the quality of the food contributed towards a very memorable evening. We shared the duck which was carved in front of us - great fun!",4
malmaison in manchester has great ambience and very attentive staff.  Food was above average though steak was rather grisly.  Having said that discount was provided to compensate.  Would reccommend this restaurant.,3
"Galvin at Windows is an excellent choice for any occasion.  We enjoyed the Scotch beef and the halibut, but unfortunately the scallop starter had sold out.  I had just mentioned in passing that it was my friend's birthday, and without any prompting the dessert arrived with ""Happy Birthday"" spelled out in chocolate.  A very nice touch, and indicative of the very fine service.  Highly recommended.",4
"Galvin at Windows was a great recommendation for ""romantic restaurants."" Service was good, but we felt rushed (possibly because we were seated at their final seating time, 10:30pm). The sea bass was extremely tasty and the ambiance/view went well with the entire experience. We recommend asking to be seated by the windows while making your reservation. The 50% deal made dining at Galvins affordable. We were disappointed at the range of desserts to choose from in the a la carte selection.",3
"Wonderful food, great ambience, superb service but a little pricey.",4
"We had the 50% bill at Galvins at Windows. The food was absolutely fantastic, i would definitely urge people to take advantage of this offer to eat at a place of this calabre that would otherwise be out of their particular price bracket.",4
"Dinner at Windows. Food 100% excelent, perfect cooking and presentation. Staff frendly & welcoming although we did get a bit fed up with being asked ""have a nice meal"" from everyone. Expensive, nearlly 5 pound for bread & butter another 5 for refil of coffee.Finally although a very cold night the restaurant was chilly.We did enjoy the night and would go again.",3
"Galvin at Windows was a lovely place to eat, the view is truely stunning and the food very very good, the service is a bit over fussy and the portions are huge. but i would recomend and i didnt feel rushed at all.",4
"Not the greatest meal I had and the wine was corked.  But the Sommelier did acknowledge this and we had our bottle replaced.  Of the three courses, only the main of duck was good.  The other two very average sadly.  Quite good service and the trimmings were nice - chocolates, amuse bouche etc.  We were over charged though which we had to highlight to the staff.  I don't think I'd go again.",1
"The view over London is great and my partner enjoyed the place itself. The food is really good, well presented with nice apetizers before starter and mignardises after dessert. With the discount of 50% off on the food, count ¬£60 per person for 3 courses and half a bottle of excellent wine (Bourgogne). I highly recommend this place especially for a surprise for your lover :)",4
"Went to Galvin at Windows for a birthday.  Took up the ¬£35 3-course offer.  Food, ambience (especially the view) and service were excellent.  The fixed price menu had some great choices - and really was good value.  Drinks however are enthusiastically priced! With the meal such good value we pushed it out on drinks.  A thirty quid bottle of wine (for four of us), bottled water, dessert wine, and a whiskey each led to some sharp intakes of breath when the final bill came..",4
"Fantastic evening. Food was a blitz of flavours and textures that although were not great in size certainly made up for with the abundance of subtle and innovative combinations. Even with the ¬£35 deal you get all the trimmings of amuse bouches, petit fours and madelaines not to mention a delicious aperatif maison. Great value for something really special. The views were inconsequential given the amazing food! Special!!",4
"Lunch at Galvin at Windows was indeed an experience. The views are fantastic! My wife's starter of risotto of lobster, baby squid and chorizzo was absolutely delicious. Indeed all food was very good, even though portions are on the small size. With the special offer of 50% on food it is very good value.",4
I had a wonderful time at Galvin at Windows. What a beautiful restaurant with wonderful food. Excellent service which started as you arrived at the hotel. Food was to die for.,4
"The pre- and post-dinner offer at Galvin is very good value for money although the food is somehow (it's hard to tell exactly how) not at the same exceptional level as the a la carte. Nevertheless, it's worth the trip out of theatreland.",4
"Galvin at Windows is a stunning venue. On a clear day the view is spectacular. Service is excellent if not perhaps a little too overbearing at time. Food was fantastic, enjoyed but everyone in party of 7. Sommelier is very informed and helped us pick some excellent wine. Venison a big hit as was the cheese board. Thank u also for excellent table just as we'd requested. All in all a highly enjoyable lunch had by all - thoroughly recommend. Will remember for a while. Thanks.",4
"Galvin at Windows frankly lived up to it's reputation. We had a great table with views over London, the food was excellent and I have to say the service was as good as it gets. Worth mentioning the sommelier recommending two superb wines with prices to match. Probably not for those on a budget but excellent for a special occasion.",4
"Galvin Wndows in a great place to go for that special meal, with great food and great service.  A top London spot.",4
"Malmaison Brasserie, Manchester- excellent food and service complimented by an excellent venue; albeit, maybe a tad too close to the Bar for an inimate dinner.",4
"Fantastic evening at Galvin's.  The TT deal went down well - all food delicious, good choice and a fantastic glass of champagne to start.  They also don't make you feel inferior for using a deal like some places.  I would go back tomorrow!
Credit crunch was certainly not hitting here, bar buzzing all night and restaurant busy.",4
"Galvin at Windows was a real treat. The service was outstanding, the food a work of art and the view - well possibly the best over London!",4
we went there for a Sunday lunch. One of the best view of London and the food was amazing. I would go back there for sure with my parents next time they will visit us.,4
"Our dining experience at Galvin at Windows was just exquisite,we had the menu gourmand and every course was a superb taste experience, First Class!",4
"Presentation, food, view and service were very good. Despite the 50% deal, if you have a cocktail and then a glass of wine with the food it soon becomes a false economy...",3
"Galvin at Windows was a delightful experience; great view, nice service and good food. had the risotto with lobster, baby squid and chorizo as a starter and that was my favourite dish for the night. left me wanting for more considering its tiny starter portion, which always makes a dish seem even more delectable that it actually is. main was the Scottish scallops with curry oil, scallops were excellent but i didn't exactly thoroughly enjoy the sauce. finally the peanut butter parfait was awesome",3
Galvin at Windows was a wonderful experience. With a marvellous view and excellent service from the staff.,4
Great food and service and even in the rain the view is good,4
"Malmaison Manchester is always a hassle-free experience, although the food is on the pricey side for what you get.  I wouldn't go there for a mind-blowing culinary feast, but if you're staying at the hotel & are looking for a dependable bite to eat, there's no easier place around Picadilly.",3
"My second trip to Malmaison, it did not disappoint! Fantastic food, service and ambience! Divine cocktails!! Cant wait to go back!",4
"This restaurant was everything we imagined it to be. Elegant setting, excellent food (good value with the 50% off deal), and extremely helpful and attentive waiting staff. The drinks were extremely overpriced comparitlvely - a gin cost &8.95 - and the tonics were an extra ¬£3! 
The toilets were impeccable, though the cubicles are a little on the small side.
Altogether a superb experience for a special occasion.",4
"Went with the 3 courses for ¬£25 meal - initial stuff up with the toptable booking made things a bit uncomfortable to start with, but once they agreed to give us the right menu it was ok. Only 2 choice per course, but all well prepared - great bread too. Amazing views!!",4
"Malmaison Brasserie - Manchester... a lovely evening in the private dining room using the ever changing home grown / set menu. Great food and great value for money. The staff were very accommodating as usual though we did not pay our full service charge as the toilets were not up to scratch. Even though 3 members of the group recommended that someone should take a look at the toilet in question and maybe have it cleaned, it remained in that unfortunate state throughout the evening. Tut tut!",4
we went for the ¬£25 3 course lunch menu and it was fabulous! highly recommended!,4
"I have to say I had very high hopes for Galvin at Windows and it did not disappoint.  The food and service was excellent.  I agree with those who say attentive but not too in much, I guess formal but not frigid if that makes sense. I would have perferred more discussion and less sending on our wine choices but they were good so I cannot complain.  Vis a vis the sample menu I expected our choices on the ¬£35 choice to be better but while not ideal they tasted very good.",3
"@nd wedding anniversary, we have booked a window table that was not ofered to us, Fortunatelly after a little conversation we have been offered what we have booked. After that the night was perfect",3
"A beautifully located restuarant with fabulous views  of green & hyde park. The food was excpetional however, it would have been nice to have been given a small bread basket rather than having to ask for additional pieces each time! A delightful night out and especially value for money with the TT deal. Great!!!!!!",3
"Galvin @ windows, top class service and amazing location, serving good food, overall we spent a great night.",4
The food was exquisite and the wine divine. We had the pheasant and it was gorgeous. I did not love my starter but my comrades thought that theirs was great.  The bill was scary at ¬£230 for 3 of us with a 30% discount but as it was a special occasion it wasnt too hard to swallow. I go anytime again....if someone else was footing the bill.,4
"went here for my 50th birthday with group of girl friends. service and food wonderful. portions are small but v rich.
had a lovely time would recommend for a special occasion.views over London fantastic",4
Thoroughly enjoyed Galvin at Windows. We went there for an anniversary dinner and found the ambience and the views the biggest selling point. Get there early and have a drink at the bar with an incredible vista over London. The food was fantastic with great service. It's certainly well worth it.,4
We had a the a la carte menu which with the special offer was very good value for money although the food was a little bland the service was attentive and the location spectacular.,3
Galvin at Windows is consistently excellent - what a view too!  Only negative is that I had to ask twice for the bill.,4
"Galvin at windows
Excellent experience from start to finish. The staff were very attentive and helpful, the food was absolutely delicious. The aperitive maison and the recommended wine were pricey but a perfect match to the meal. The surroundings are  la piece de resistance. i would highly recommend it for a special occassion as the price tag is hefty.",4
"Having booked Galvin at Windows for our anniversary we were hoping for something special and we weren't disappointed. The food was lovely, the service was very good and the views spectacular. A wonderful place to visit.",4
"The food at Galvin at Windows was above average, but the setting was fantastic. I'd recommend arriving early for a cocktail in the bar area.",3
A fantastic evening with wonderful food and service. The staff were exceptional and in particular making our 8 year old daughter feel very special on her birthday trip to London,4
Gavin at Windows is only worth the effort because of the view. The duck egg starter was not nice but the pheasant main course was very good. The portions were tiny. Watch out for add ons if you are having the ¬£25 deal and don't forget to ask for the complimentary glass of bubbly.,2
"Galvin at Windows had all the elements needed for a great fine dining experiece. The food was excellent, not too fussy just great ingredients perfectly cooked. My only disappointment was the desert but that was through my poor choice not the execution. The service was also first class. All in all it was an expensive treat but well worth it",3
Galvin at Windows was perfect for an intimate birthday celebration.  Fanstastic food.,4
"Galvin at Windows has a stunning setting at the top of the Hilton hotel overlooking London, views are amazing. The atmosphere and food are also really something, highly recommended for a special occasion (the 50% deal makes it much more affordable, though the drinks are pricey). The pheasant I had is I think the best meat I've ever eaten. The service is extremely attentive (to the point where a waiter shows you to the toilet the moment you stand up...!). Definitely worth a visit!",4
"I took a client to Galvin ‚Äì beautiful place on 28th floor Hilton. Food was light and good and service was good but to the point of being too considerate. They are VERY pricey so without 50% off the bill I would probably not go there again (unless I am not the one paying). 

Its worth visiting though and its a good place to impress ur date or clients.",3
"Hi-if you want fantastic views, Galvin at Windows should be your first choice. Great service and food.",3
"Perfect restaurant for a special location.  Attentive service without being obtrusive, and superb menu. The 50% offer made this a treat not to be missed!",4
Galvin at the Windows was over priced for the food but the service was exceptional. We took two 6 month old babies and they couldn't do enough for us. If the prices were more reasonable (even after the top table 50% off it was way too pricy) we would go again.,3
Would highly recommend Sunday lunch at Galvin at Windows to anyone seeking a high quality relaxing dining experience at a reasonable cost,4
Excellent food and superb service - attentive but not over-bearing. Fabulous location and super for a special occasion,4
Galvin at Windows is a great place for brilliant views of London,4
"I booked a table for 8 especially for some friends visiting london, We had a fabulous table with truly panoramic views of the city and service was truly outstanding ,a refreshing change for dining in london. Will definately visit again.",4
"Galvin at Windows was indeed an gastronomical delight with views that were wonderful!  I will return and can highly recommend the venue.  Even with the Toptable offer it was a little pricey with wine, service etc.  However it was most definately worth it!",4
"Galvin at Windows was the perfect venue. With the best views I've ever seen from a restaurant in London. 
Going for my graduation Lunch, they could not have been more attentive. The food is some of the best I've ever eaten, with the deal 3 courses and a Galvin Bellini for ¬£25 it was a steal. 
An increadable cullinary experience all round, and another mention for the service which was flawless.
I cannot recommend this Restaurant highly enough.",4
"Galvin at windows is a magnificent venue for special one off occasions, fanstastic views, very relaxed atmospher and excellent food, bit pricey but it is a high class venue!",3
"Galvin at Windows offers high quality food in stylish surrounds. The food was excellent, but the service, whilst polite, was wayward and too attentive (!) due to a lack of communication between staff.",3
Fabulous meal at Galvin at Windows especially with the 50% off food deal. Excellent service and wonderful ambience. Great views over London. Would recommend and hope to go back.,4
We went to Malmaison Brasserie for a last minute sunday dinner last night. The entrance to the hotel is amazing as is the food. I must recommend the Mussel and Clam Chowder - it was devine. For those with a bigger appetite then you just have to try the Mal Burger with gorgeous skinny fries - be warned though-It's HUGE!! The staff were very helpful and the restaurant itself was lovely - it was a bit dark though and they had left the cheeseboard out which did smell a bit but they happily moved it!,3
"Fantastic service, food and venue.  Great value for money on toptable offer.  Can't fault!",4
"Galvin at Windows. Booked table for 9pm, but it wasnt ready until 9.40pm, so had to wait in the bar. Luckily it was a nice bar. other than that the food and the service were very good. We had a table by the window, which has spectacular views over London. Ideal for a special occasion, but without a toptable special offer, probably too expensive for anything more than a one-off visit",3
"excellent view and great main courses!!do not try the duck egg,,,,",3
"I booked this restaurant via toptable for a birthday, requested a window seat online thru the form, but this was either forgotten or ignored. There were lots of empty seats by the window which were unoccupied, which I take as either reserved or for high paying customers? Fish tasted really good and had the right texture. The ham tasted slightl y bland, and could be improved.  Environment 10/10.
However, if you're not sitting at a windowseat, opt to go to the bar after. 13 quid for a cocktail.",4
"We went to Galvin at Windows for our 20th wedding anniversary and had a wonderful evening, absolutely faultless.  We also stayed the night at the Hilton so did not have to worry about getting home.  A night to remember",4
"Excellent food, very professionally served, and a good wine list.",4
"Went to Galvins @ Windows for a special event. My mothers 65th Birthday. The food was very good, the service close to impeccable, and my mother enjoyed the evening thoroughly. Not the cheapest of venues but well worth it for a special evening",4
"You get great views right across London from Galvin‚Äôs. The food was very good (I would recommend the beef. It is really tender) and the service was excellent. It is expensive, but worth it for a special treat.",4
windows was lovely for my birthday and I would recommend for a special occasion as it feels luxurious and service is top class. food well cooked and tasty if maybe a little on the small side but ok if 3 courses as it all balances and you leave full.pricey without top table offer though!,3
View was great and service excellent. Nice added touch with complimentary glass of champagne and bits and pieces. Good experience.,4
"As Always, great food and great spot.
A very enjoyable night.
Thank You",3
Best lunch I've had in ages.  The chicken was a treat. The Pear Tarte Tatin was delicious...i would definately go again and again... Great value for money with the discount.,4
"Galvin at Windows is a lovely place to go. I booked the TT deal and took my boyfriend for a meal.  The service is great, and the food was lovely.  Our only criticism would be that both main courses were bland, particularly the cod.  The beef was tasteless and not worthy of the ¬£5 supplement we have better steak at home.  All in all a lovely place to go for a special meal.",4
"Galvin at windows was a really pleasant dining experience. The atmosphere is buzzy but not too loud, and the service was very good. The views are fantastic day and night, and they even uphled our request of a table window! The food of course s excellent, and good value for 50%.",4
"Galvin at Windows is an amazing location. The views over London are spectacular - something that is not easy to find - making this a truly London experience. The service was great - very attentive - and when they sat us initially not next to a window, I asked if they could give us a window seat (as requested in the reservation), and they kindly moved us to a wonderful view over Buckingham Palace. The food was good but the beef was disappointing - OK - but not melt in your mouth. A lovely evening",4
"I took my wife to Galvin's for her birthday at lunch time. The service was excellent and started with a cocktail in the bar.

Staff were a little keen to ensure we ordred food quickly, however we were not rushed thereafter and it took 1 hour 45 minutes to complete our 3 courses.

Starter of slow cooked duck egg was great and the Fillet of Beef just melted in the mouth. For cheese lovers, take the cheese trolley...and select as much cheese as you like...it's great.",4
"Excellent venue, great views, service works like clockwork - you don't see it at many places these days.  The food and desserts are wonderful.  A place for a special occasion.",4
"The food at Galvin at Windows was superb, there were lots of little extras which made it a really special place to go for my boyfriends brithday.  Even with the 50% off though it wasn't cheap, especially if you order any alcoholic drinks, but for a special occasion I think it was worth it as the setting is pretty spectacular and the staff are attentive to your every need.",4
an outstanding meal with super service and marvellous views!!,4
"nice food, annoyingly mardy maitridie but otherwise good experience",3
Galvin at Windows.  We went here for my birthday and the views of London are lovely.  Food was amazing and the service was exceptional too.  The cost was a little on the high side but I guess it was worth it as it was something more special.,4
The views were amazing! The staff were very friendly and the service was excellent. We really enjoyed the food esp the chocolate fondant!,3
"Galvin @ Windows certainly has one of the best ambience in London: fascinating view of London from 28th floor. The service could have been better for the place like this. Our table wasn't ready when we arrived, we were asked to wait because the chef was overloaded...However, the food exceeded my expectations: it was very good. I highly recommend going to Galvin and enjoy a wonderful meal.",4
"Had a very nice dinner at Galvin at Windows.
Portions were small, but the selection was adequate for the deal, and we still left full
they made us feel very welcome, even though we didn't order wine.  It was a very nice night. thanks",4
"We had a fabulous evening at Galvin at Windows. The food was really excellent, and the special offer made it a bargain! They also give you lots of lovely extras which makes it so special.  The service was amazing. Really impressed. Loved it.",4
My friend and I went to Galvin at Windows for my birthday and we had a fantastic night.  The waiters couldn't have been more helpful and moved us to a window table when we asked if there were any free.  The food was delicious and we loved the little extras that they kept bringing between courses.  All in all we had a great night and are looking forward to an opportunity to go back!,4
"Had a great evening at Galvins at Windows with a wonderful nightview of London that was breathtaking. Our table of 3 had the taster menu that was good quality throughout but was not ""spectacular"" as I would have preferred a little more imagination and more creativity for the dishes (though very tasty). The bar next door got really noisy and heaving later towards the evening which was a little too loud for me. However overall a great experience.",3
"Galvin @ Windows London Hilton Hotel Park Lane
Fantastic experience. Service was impeccable as was the views. Excellent dining would definetaly go again",4
"A fabulous setting with amazing views, however, while the food is good the portions are very small.",3
"Galvin at Windows dissapointed on the extra touches for a special occasion. I had requested a table by the window & a special 'Happy Birthday' Dessert. I had both of these requests confirmed on the phone prior to my visit but neither was done.

There are stunning views and the food and wine were amazing. The 50% deal was well worth it as it saved me just over ¬£60. The cocktails in the bar were double the price of normal cocktails but were delicious and the views are really what you pay for.",3
"Malmaison is  a good quality restaraunt. No complaints over the food or service. It was a little quiet and perhaps not quite as swish as I'd been hoping but a minor grumble. 
The wine list is very good but prices are a little steep.",3
"Went to Galvin at Windows during the week. A great restaurant for the views alone! Food was great, and under the toptable offer was great value for money. The seabass was to die for, and will definitely go back soon",4
Good food and really nice ambient,4
Galvin at Windows is on the 28th Floor and the views across London were stunning.   It was a birthday treat for my husband who really enjoyed the soup starter and fish dish from the 'special' menu. The plates were beautifully presented and the delicious chocolates and homemade marshmallows were a delightful surprise at the end of our meal. Very good Toptable value. Much enjoyed.,4
"I took my parents to Galvin at Windows for a special occasion for the view and although I requested a window seat, I was told there were none available when I got there. They were quick with initial service but if we asked to be given a couple of minutes more, then we were ignored for quite a long time after that so much that we had to usher them over. Food was pretty good and we had a nice evening but had a problem with the bill, which had to be sent back 3 times, which wasn't a pleasant end.",2
"Myself and my two best friends did the tasting menu at Galvin at Windows. It was ¬£110 including wine for all courses. The portions started off tiny and we were worried! But after a fabulous foie gras with a great montbaizallac we started filling up so much so that the hot chocolate fondant was beyond us. Service was hit and miss - the sommelier was fabulous, knew loads about the wine and answered questions but we were left for a long time at the start without drinks or having taken menu. Enjoyed",2
"We had booked a meal at Galvins for my partners birthday, we had the set menu all of which tasted wonderful, they really do take the time and effort with everything and nothing is too much. Overall we had a fab time and will visit again. Be careful of the drinks they are quite pricey ..",4
"Great venue and so glad I finally visited. The views over London are breathtaking and the bar was excellent too. Staff all very friendly and service superb. Cocktails good, but a little expensive, but the venue made up for that. Food was very tasty. Next time I go, I might go for the main menu though as some of the options did look superb. Will certainly visit again sometime.",4
"We thought the pre-theatre set menu at ¬£19.50 was very good value, though drinks were an expensive extra (¬£7.50 for a glass of Budvar lager - less than a pint).  The view was very enjoyable. We had fun spotting landmarks from the novel location. The staff were friendly and didn't seem negative about the special offer. The food was great too.
We would like to go again, as different tables have different views.",4
"Our first time at Galvin at Windows and it wont be our last. It must surely be one of the best settings for a restaurant. We asked for a window table and were shown to a table over looking Buckingham Palace. Stunning. The service was excellent, not at all intrusive but very attentive. My wife said it was the best 3 courses she has eaten. She had marinated salmon, halibut and we shared the best pear tarte tatin either of us has eaten. Would definitely recommend Windows.",4
The food at Galvins was incredible and a real bargain with the 50% off offer (would have been a bit too pricey otherwise). I had the seabass and my boyfiriend had the lamb - both were wonderful - i think the lamb is the best I've ever tasted. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a special occasion.,4
"Galvin at Windows was an excellent dining experience. We had a drink in the bar prior to the meal which was excellent. In the restaurant, the setting was amazing with views over London. The service was top notch and sometimes it felt like there were too many staff around - however not a bad thing. The food was excellent with a great deal of attention paid to each of the courses. Pricey, as it was our anniversary well worth it, and you expect to be paying for the view!!",4
"Four of us enjoyed a birthday meal at Galvin at Windows, the setting and service was everything you could expect and more.  Even with the 50% deal there was a good range available on the menu.  The food quality was impressive, only the black forest gateux was disappointing.",4
"Galvin at Windows was amazing. The food was delicious and seemed to keep coming, finishing with amazing marshmallows. Views were amazing as well. All in all a brilliant meal and would love to go back. Was quite expensive but we had 50% off the a la carte so I think it was good value overall.",4
Nice view and great service,3
"Booked top table 3 course dinner offer for our anniversary and the staff were very accommodating with the request for a window table. The food was delicious and the service excellent - you will never be forgotten, though this can be a bad thing too. I had the seared tuna, followed by the pork and finally an espresso cheesecake. Couldn't fault. The icing on the cake was our timing for a perfect sunset over London. A wonderful evening that my girlfriend and I will never forget.",4
Galvin at Windows.  Service was great. As were the views. The toptable la carte menu was a little disappointing compared to the regular la carte menu....,3
Galvin at Windows is a superb vantage point. My experience of the restaurant however was disappointing. The food on the promotion menu was nothing better than you could get at Waitrose and the over attentive waitors were intrusive. I hope the a la carte menu is better. 5 / 10,2
The food at Galvin at Windows was superb - beautifully balanced and well presented.  Sevice was good. The suggested wine was good and not the most expensive.  Thursday lunchtime was very quiet - can't think why more don't go here.  We ate a la carte which was not too bad at around ¬£100 per head given it was a specal occasion and the quality of the meal was on a par with Gordon Ramsey in Chelsea. Note kir royale and champagne cocktail pricey at over ¬£12 each,4
"An excellent meal at Galvin, with lovely views,over London, an as usual.  Food was excellent, the two part lamb chops accompanyed withseasonal vegetables in a boullion was beautifully tender in the first part with a rich flavoursome boullion. 

Our sommelier came straight in with  a recommendation for a ¬£96 wine! Ouch! We were somewhat surpised, as in my experience sommeliers usually start with a more reasonably priced bottle. Perhaps this reflected this gentleman's inexperience?",3
"We went for a romantic birthday treat and it was brilliant.  Food was excellent, the staff were very friendly and having the extra little touches i.e. the birthday dessert treat made the evening very special.  I would recommend this place.",4
very nice resturant my second time there actually the food for me was not as nice as the first time. however there was excellent service and ambience very nice. it was good value for money too.,3
"Food was ok, but I was expecting more. Do not expect very generous plates. Service was excelent. The view is amazing, although since we are in London, its hard to be lucky with the weather.",3
"Galvin at Windows provided us with great value for money with the best food, service and location.",4
"We booked the table under the pre theater menu offer. But I changed my mind the night before the meal. Galvin's staff happily helped me to arrange it. It was my boyfrien's birthday on that day, they gave me a window-facing table and surprised him with the cake I brought in. The food was vey well presented and tasty. Highly recommended!",4
"Our visit to Galvin at Windows was fantastic!  The choice of the ¬£35 set menu was fairly limited but still nice!  

The waiters/waitresses were very attentive and helpful

We would definitely go back!  A breathtaking experience!",4
"Excellent food and service, and impressive views of the city  make it a great location. We went for the 50% off all food offer, which saved ¬£55 off the bill- outstanding value!",4
"28th Floor views of London, wonderful service and great food at Galvin at Windows on Park Lane but expect to pay Mayfair prices, our dinner for 2 came to ¬£135 and thats with the top table offer.Wines start from ¬£28 most around the ¬£50/60 mark.There was a great buzz to the restaurant and the evening was made by the little touches like marshmallows in a jar made fresh after the bill was paid.If your looking for a romantic place to eat overlooking this great city this has got to be one of the best.",3
"Our group had an amazing time at Galvin at Windows. The service was very good, staff very friendly and they even moved us to a window seat when one became available. The views are amazing and the deals they have on makes it even more worthwhile!",4
Lovely restaurant and very helpful staff.  Special offer on the 3 course a la carte menu is great value.  Would recommend.,4
"Great view of London from dinner table, but limited set menu options.Service overall was good but when it got busy had to wait a while for dessert. Not for people who like big portions.",3
We opted for the tasting menu which was a huge amount of food but a really nice way to sample lots of yummy dishes and wines... The service was really good and they moved us to a window seat the moment we asked.,4
"The food at Galvin at Windows was excellent and the views at lunchtime amazing.  The service was very attentive but at times too attentive with waiters hovering to take your glass whilst you were taking your last sips.  The wine list was extensive but expensive.  The food, especially with the 25% offer, was good value given the quality but the overall bill still came out very expensive with the cost of the drink.  Overall, an excellent place for a special occasion.",4
"Very nice food, nice view especially if you seat by the window (otherwise you cannot see much). Wine quite expensive.  Not good value for money without the 50% off.",3
Galvin at Windows has a great view but their food has been better on previous visits.  My starter of goats cheese was not that impressive although my main was better.  The cheese was good but I was expecting to be more blown away by the food.  We were also sat in the middle section so could not appreciate the view.  Some nice wine and excellent company so an enjoyable evening overall.,3
"Food was delicious, veal sweetbreads was a winner!  and with toptable discount proved affordable. Be warned Wine is expensive.  Outstanding view over north london.  Staff friendly and very professional.  Great Mid-week treat. Would definetely recommend Galvin especially for the windows!",4
"Hi , Main course was really bland with not much flavor at all",3
"The view at Galvin at windows was fabulous!! We had fantastic food and great service, would definitely recommend this restaurant if you want to impress. Quite expensive though - you definitely need a special offer deal (we had 50% off food).",4
We had a wonderful meal at Galvin at Windows.  It was for a birthday and the occasion was made extra special by the views and great service. Plus a chocolatey 'happy birthday' was added to the pudding - a lovely touch.,4
"Dinner at Galvin at Windows was a good experience. Food was excelent with a couple of compliments from the chef. Service was good and 50% of the food was a good value for money. Over all it's a good restaurant, but it doesn't have a WOW factor (for me) unless you've got a table by the window and we didn't ,dispite asking couple of times",4
Great quality food and venue for an excellent offer. They even overeheard my friends wishing me happy birthday and so our waiter secretly arranged for happy birthday to be written on my dessert plate in chocolate !!! Nice added touch to make the whole evening so special.,3
the experience at Galvin at windows was excellent.,3
Exceptional surroundings for a elegant lunch,4
We had veal brain for a main course! It was exotic and tasty.,3
"Very nice hams and meats to start, followed by a delicious burger. The service was very good also, however, at 7:30 on Friday night, the atmosphere was a little dim. Overall a decent meal in pleasant surroundings.",3
"The view is great, but unless your table is by the window i.e. for a booking of 4 or more then you don't really get the full benefit. In case it wasn't already obvious it's a check your wallet in at the door job.. ¬£8 for a bottle of beer should give you an idea of what to expect!",3
"Fantastic location with great views over London. A bit over-priced, even with the discounted offer. Otherwise, it would be a top pick for me.",3
"fantastic view, excellent food and service",4
The food was nice but not great. My steak was overcooked and had to be sent back. An alarm went off for the last 20 minutes of the meal somewhat ruining our meal. The views are fab and staff helpful.,3
"Superb!We very much enjoyed our meal at Galvin at Windows. We were seated at a table with a wonderful view over Hyde Park. The a la carte menu was very well balanced, punctuated by several surprises such as a melon soup to start, madaleines and marshmallows! The wine, too, was excellent and reasonably priced. Yes, the meal was rather expensive but the 50% top table deal made it affordable as a special treat and couldn't be faulted. Will certainly be visiting again!",4
"The view is spectacular. Food excellent and good value with the set menu deal, although the choices were limited. Service was excellent especially early evening when everything is quiet, we got all the attention which was nice.",4
"This is the place to take someone when you want the best dining experience possible. Everything was perfect & the amazing view over the city breathtaking. If you are on a budget be careful not to order extra drinks/coffee (but remember to say yes to the Pommeray) as this quickly doubles the cost of the deal. However, the free spontaneous extras (silver platter of hand made chocolates, light as a feather madelaine cakes, glass bowl of lime & rasberry marshmallows) made it a lunch to remember.",4
"The view at Galvin at windows in the Hilton is incredible, and allows you to see London in a different way. The service is excellent, with care and attention shown towards you as the diner, making you feel like a treasured customer. The food is presented beautifully, with well thought out combinations of flavours presented to your palate, however the portions are on the conservative side for those with a larger appetite.  It was an enjoyable dining experience, which I would recommend.",4
Excellent value for money at Galvins.,3
the views were pretty nice from the 28th floor.,4
"Galvin at Windows, Hilton Hotel, Park Lane was an excellent place for a special meal.  The views over the London skyline are fantastic.  The food was lovely and beautifully presented.  The service was first class and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.  A place to definitely return.  Brilliant cocktails in the bar.",4
"As with many of these offers, without the 50% off offer, this would be too expensive. The a la carte price was ¬£58 each (obviously one of these was free) but with wine and coffee, that brought the total to ¬£116 for two of us. The service was generally excellent (only one minor hiccup) but generally very attentive. The food was good but we both found it a little salty. Dessert: the pear tart for two was HUGE. Could have served 4. All in all, ""very good"".",3
"We booked an early dinner at Galvin at Windows and it was a good choice. The view is absolutely amazing. a must for anyone who enjoys food with view. 
The food was also very good. We had the tasting menu and were quite prepared to pay full price as the dicount seemed to apply only to the a la carte so were very pleasantly surprised  to see that the 50% off food had been honored! The service was very good and tso was the food  although  I found it a little on the traditional side.",3
"This restaurant has received mixed reviews in the past, however we couldnt fault it last night.Great efficient service, intimate atmosphere and food to die for.The black forest martini was wonderful. Would go there again for that alone!",4
"The food and wine were excellent, there is no denying this.  Price was high but this was expected.  Only complaint was service; all staff were very professional and helpful but they would not leave us alone.  Every 2 minutes one of 5 members of staff who waited on us would be at our table-side, pouring wine, clearing a glass/plate, wiping the table etc.  All very necessary things but not every 2 minutes.  Did not feel rushed but could not relax fully to enjoy the magnificent views!!  NEEDS MUSIC",2
Me & my husband celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary at Galvin at Windows and it made a special occasion.  The service was excellent - the staff were very attentive.  The food was lovely & with the 50% off it was good value.  Drinks were quite pricey but you would expect that in a venue like this. The view was magnificent and we could see for about 30 miles. All together a very pleasant evening.,4
"Galvin at Windows provided a brilliant all-round experience for lunch. Views were amazing, food well presented with a great amount of detail. Ambience good and service attentitive, but not intrusive.",4
"We all loved it%u226 an amazing place, impeccable service and a very piquant lunch!
Thanks Top Table for the 50% offer the only way for us (8) to afford it, but worth every penny!",4
"Fabulous!  The best of French with London views.  Superb dining experience.  Lamb was perfection!  Put this restaurant 
on your top ten list.",4
"The view from Galvin at Windows is exceptional, but the food doesn't live up to it. We ordered from the A La Carte (50% off!) and were satisfied, rather than impressed. The starters set the tone with a very small portion of very good foie gras, and a very ordinary smoked salmon served with caviar. The steaks for main course were good, but only good - certainly not worth full price. Overall the food is like the restaurant itself, it looks very impressive, but doesn't deliver where it counts.",3
We chose set lunch menu but it was very limited. No pork left so were offered veal brains which didnt go down very well with teenagers! so you were left with either fish or veg option.,2
Wonderful food and service and a great view of London,4
"This is our 3rd time at Galvin @ Windows and, as usual, the food was fantastic and the service faultless.  One of my favourite restaurants in London.",4
Excellent value for money. Would have been nice to have had a window table although did not detract from the meal or the service that we received.- Efficient yet friendly.  Very helpful advice over wine selection and a nice touch to dessert (it was our weddng anniversary..) Enjoyed the food although did feel a little rushed- had to vacate the table by 8pm. Still early meal was worth it.,4
"@ Galvin at Windows

Waiting at the bar (rammed with loud suits drinking champers ) we were concerned for the ambience...

Having entered the restaurant all was well, air con is fierce - (take a jumper!) but food is amazing, staff attentive and we had an excellent night. Yes it's expensive (we spent 160 without wine on a la cart) but it is good!

Recommend
Starter - loch duart Salmon / foie gras
Main - Cornish lamb / Halibut

  Staff gave us details on their coffee blend!
- Aircon",4
"Galvin's has a fantastic view over the city, which in itself made the meal very enjoyable.  Food was also tasty, though nothing mind blowing.  Service was attentive yet unobstrusive.  Seems like lots of business diners when we were there for weekday lunch.  Overall, very nice setting for either business or pleasure.",4
i phoned windows to explain it was a surprise birthday dinner for my husband.  they were really welcoming and helped to make the night a lovely experience..  i do think the portions could have been a little bigger but we were given extra rolls and butter and certainly didnt leave hungry.  i would recommend the restaurant.,4
"We had a fantastic evening at Galvins on the 50% off deal.  It was a pricey restaurant, and drinks are not cheap - but you don't go here every day and for the atmosphere, amazing view, service and stunning food it was worth it.  My boyfriend said it was the best steak he had ever eaten and that says it all really!!  The view is fantastic - and got even better later on when lightening started in the distance.  A great place, which i woudl recommend to anyone for a special occaission.",4
"Food was of a high quality with a good tentative service. View was absolutely fantastic, well worth a visit especially with the Toptable offer.",4
"Very nice restaraunt, great if you want the full works. Amazing selection of cheese and after dinner drinks, though would have liked the starter and main course selection to be larger. Good food, lots of attention to minute detail. Downside - too many staff walking around",3
Excellent as always!,4
"Galvin at the windows was fantastic value for money with the 50% offer. Tables were a little close and we couldn't get one by the windows, but the service was impeccable. Food also delicious, highly recommended",4
Galvin at Windows truly deserves it's Michelin star. Everything from service to the ambience to the food was prepared and executed in a superb way. The food simply impeccable. Only the wine list tends to go quickly into the very expensive range.,4
"Galvin At Windows. 
We went for dinner.Really GREAT food. Would recommend the 8 course degustation menu (¬£75.00). Service was attentive and Sommeliers choice good.
Negatives-  In the bar we went to look at the fabulous view and when we returned to our table- someone else had been sat there! NO CHOICE other than a la carte and tasting menu was shown.  We received NO EXTRA's (ie. no amuse bouche or sorbet between courses) which you expect!
Dinner for 2. all inc., ¬£300 SPECIAL OCCASSIONS ONLY!",4
"good meal, good service but a little bit pricey on the wine and coffee side .
the view is spectacular.",3
"Fantastic view of the city.  Despite being on the 3 courses for ¬£35 offer we still got a window seat.  
Throughout the meal there were small suprises such as petit fours,marshmallows etc that made a memorable occasion.",4
"This is the third time that I have been to Galvin @ The Windows in the past couple of months and once again, last nights visit was superb! Food amazing, service perfect and the overall experience fabulous! I will be returning!",4
"Galvins has a great view over central London and offers reasonably priced food, and good (slightly over attentive) service. 
They also didn't kick us out at 7:15PM as there were empty tables on a Sat night.
The food was ok-good, but not amazing. The best meals were the mains and desserts. The entrees were unusual but no one in our group really liked them that much.
Drinks are quite expensive (¬£8 for a beer).",3
"We booked the pre theatre dinner for ¬£19.95 each. The food in not great, and taste like a ¬£19.95 for 3 courses, and we were being rushed around. Not impressed at all. The view of the window was great though.",1
Galvin at Windows is great for a special occassion as you do pay for the lovely views and quality food.  We enjoyed a cocktail & city views from the bar area before dinner and then settled down to sit through the degustation menu.  Probably ate too much food by the end of the night!  But it was all so different and delicious it was hard to say no.,3
"Galvin at Windows was a lovely place to while away a friday afternoon. Food was good wholesome and beautifully presented, service was discreet but attentive and the views were superb! Good value on toptable and nice extras such as homemade marshmallows :)",3
"Amazing view over London, extremely attentive service and a good selection on the set menu.  We were also plied with several sweets following our two courses - a nice touch. Highly recommended!",4
"Windows at The Hilton. Well if the purpose of the night was just to make my German in laws (who had never been to London before) speechless for at least 15 mins then I and the restaurant achieved their goal.
We were treated incredibly well even when we all ordered from the ¬£35 for three courses menu. We also were given a entres, a bellini, a palate cleanser and petit fours with our coffee all extras and all unexpected. The views from this 28th floor restaurant across central London are amazing.",4
Wonderful lunch with one of the best views of London. Great service and food  but watch the price of the mint tea at ¬£4.75,4
"Windows is a stunning venue, but the experience of dining is somewhat spoilt by the generally cold attitude of the waiters, and the over-done service that gave a constant impression of being watched. They were not gracious to adjust for special dietary requirements, and did so only reluctantly. However, all in all we did not regret our visit, and they did meet our window seat request for a special occasion",2
Service at Galvin was impeccable and I had the most equisite beef fillet ever. Fact.,4
"Amazing views, interesting atmophere, good service.",3
"Not the place for a cheap night out, but definitely a spectacular venue with great service and busy buzzy feel. Galvin at Windows served up an extensive and interesting tasting menu, with all the accompanying wines - it was a full evenings entertainment and well worth it for a special night out. The views on a clear summers night are wonderful. Glad I've been there, would definitely recommend it, but you need to save your pennies first.",4
Service was over-fussy and interfering,2
Wow what a view Galvin's have.  We went for a late dinner and were given a great table at the window.  Service was sharpe and staff polite and helpful.  We opted for the 3 courses for ¬£35 and portions were just right.  The sundried tomato risotto was fantastic.  Would love to go back.,4
Galvin at Windows was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. The restaurant staff were very pleasant and efficient. We had requested a window table as we were celebrating our daughters graduation. Not only did we have probably an excellent table they also brought some chocolates with congratualions on them for her special treat. Food was 3 courses from a choice of 3 for each course. We all had something different and each of us enjoyed our course. We would certainly go again.,4
"Went for a business lunch to Galvin at Windows and enjoyed it thoroughly. Food was excellent (though a bit too much salt in the lobster bisque), as was the ambience - and then there's that spectacular view! Service was a bit excessive - seems like we were interrupted every three minutes. But a very sleek, stylish and tasty event.",3
Galvin at Windows was an excellent venue for dinner. The service was attentive yet at the same time the waiters knew when to leave you to dine in peace. The food was excellent although a little on the pricey side. Good wine selection and the a la carte menu offered a wide choice of unusual but well chosen dishes. The only down side was the fact that in choosing the restaurant for its views we were given one of the internal tables which offered little in terms of view!,4
"The offer at Galvin at Windows (19.50 2 courses and a glass of Pommery) was fantastic.  We were treated with fantastic views and the food was gorgeous.  The service was disappointing in that we waited a long time between courses, but this was recognised and we were offered a complimentary glass of wine which more than made up for it.  Definitely recommend.",4
"The meal at Galvin at Windows was of good quality throughout with some exceptionally excellent parts - starters and deserts in particular.  Foie gras seemed to be overpresented which was great if you like the stuff which we did fortunately.  i would recommend the eel with foie gras starter and the martini black forest desert, I was a bit dissappointed with the main course dish I had which was the beef (and had an additional cost) considering the price of this menu.",3
I would highly reccomend the pre theatre dinner and would rate it excellent value for money.,4
"windows was amazing, brilliant view, fabulous food, great service!!!! the 3 course post theatre deal is really good value",4
"Wow! Amazing! From the minute we stepped into the restaurant everything was perfect. We dined on a deal but were treated like a diner paying full price. The sommelier recommended a ¬£23 South African Chardonnay, which I took a chance on (I don't usually like Chardonnay) and it was fantastic. I liked the fact that he didn't push an expensive bottle. We ordered a second bottle and took it to the bar after dinner where we enjoyed views of London and the background music and jovial chatter around us.",4
"This was my second visit and although not as great as the first, the overall experience was amazing. The first time I went for the more expensive set menu which was much more impressive than the cheaper one, and so I will be going for that one again next time. I will definitely be back!",4
"My concerns of attending a top restaurant like Galvin at Windows were soon forgotten when we were welcomed in to the restaurant.  A fantastic view across the panorama of London just added to the occasion.
Past reviews have mentioned the expense of the food.  Yes, it is expensive, however I would say worth every penny.  Each dish was a work of art and much more filling than it would first appear.  The service was second to none, not one bit pretentious, but every bit professional and courteous.",4
"Galvin at Windows for me is about the location and aspect more than the food, although saying that the food was very good, the service was attentivebut not over the top. One place I will be dining at in the future.",3
"Galvin at Windows, was booked as a special birthday celebration lunch for 6 of us lady shoppers down to London for the day and it did not let us down, we requested a good window table and we got just that. The food was great, the service was fab and all in all, I cant wait to go back.  We had the set menu which was a little ltd, but for ¬£30 per head inc water and a couple of glasess of the house champange each and 2 very good courses, we where all very happy dinners.",4
"Tried the Degustation menu, which was certainly very interesting.  This involved getting around 6 dishes which were each fresh and innovative dishes which you are not likely to try in most other restuarants.  The service is top-notch, but you do pay for that in the price of the food.  Highly recommended if you are looking for something different and to say you've been somewhere not ordinary!",3
"I went to Galvins and had a superb pea soup, followed by pork with smoked eel.  Unfortunately the eel was too strong in flavour and ruined the pork for me.  They kindly offered to exchange the meal, which considering it was my fault for choosing it, thought was very nice of them.  I don't recommend the dish.  The apple tart was great and the view over London was stunning",4
"Galvin at windows is the bets toptable meal deal I have ever had. the service was impeccable, the food amazing and the ambience great. the only critisim would be that there was not much to chose from although the red mullet was to die for. A definite must for all toptable customers.",4
"What a stunning venue Galvin at Windows is for a special meal. The views are wonderful, the food is imaginative and the service is second to none and really adds the wow factor to the experience. Highly recommend it. We felt spoilt by the highly professional and clearly dedicated team.",4
"Great service, gorgeous view.",3
"the choice of pre theatre menu is limited, while pea soup and risottos are excellent, the pate, and the chicken dishes are quite ordinary. The dessert also failed to impress.",2
"The main reason I booked this restaurant was for the view and this did not disappoint.  The food was wonderful, but with typical small portions.  The service was attentive and friendly at all times.  Overall a great experience.",4
"We were given a fantastic table with views of the park at Galvin at Windows. The service really was impeccable however the pricing structure wasn't entirely clear and so the meal ended up being slightly more expensive than intended. However did discover an amazing Pinot Noir based on the advice of our wine waiter. We ate the summer vegetable salad, foie gras, wild salmon and lamb cutlets - all wonderfully presented and a wonderful mix of flavours. The highlight for me though was the cheese board",3
"Galvins is fantastic for a girls night out, the special menu was fairly limited although we did choose starters from the main menu for an additional fee - fantastic evening!",4
"amazing amazing amazing
cant recommend galvin at windows more
were given the best table in the restaurant with the most stunning of panoramic views
waiters were wonderfully attentive, food presentation perfect
lovely way to celebrate graduating",4
"Great!! One of the best venues in London. The view, service, ""mise en bouche"", starters, desserts, wine... I recommend you to come without the offer or ask to be by the windows and try their own menu. However, the quality of the bread and Hilton's entrace could be improved.",4
Galvin and Windows was an excellent choice for a very special family celebration. And their set lunch menu offered a good choice that suited both meat-eaters and vegetarians - and was excellent value for money.,4
"Galvin at Windows, on top of the London Hilton Hotel, was a great place for a midweek breakfast.  Full English at ¬£9.75 is well cooked and good value, although cafitiere coffee at ¬£2.50 and juice at ¬£3.50 is quite steep - although they do refil for free.  View is superbe though - and particuarly good in the morning sunlight.  Staff were very friendly and attentive without being overly so.  All in all a super place for breakfast.",4
"We had a beutiful night, service amazing and great that the message that it was my mans birthday got yo the table!

The G&T were far too expensive-¬£23 for 2!

We will return",4
"A great experience - service was fantastic with everything flowing so smoothly by very friendly and attentive staff with great knowledge. It seemed they knew as soon as you needed something as it was already being done, but not pretentious at all. Gladly got window seats which made the night.",3
"The interior was dark and sumptuous, not really suited to daytime dining. It was quiet for a Sunday afternoon, so if you're going for the deal don%u219t expect it to be busy. We mixed and matched from the set and regular menu and ended up paying a lot more than expected, with service charge added as standard to the bill  %u213something which almost certainly doesn't get passed to the waiting staff. The lamb was slightly chewy, but the pate starter was amazing. Liked it, but not worth it without the deal",3
Absolutely fantastic - cannot fault our evening at all!,4
I picked galvin at the windows for a special occasion and they certainly did not let me down. I got engaged at the windows last weekend and the staff and restaurant manager made it a fantastic night. They service was top class and the food was excellent. I would highly recommend this venue for that special occasion. It is more expensive then you would probably expect but worth evry penny for that special occasion. Try get a table along the windows to get the best possible effect from the venue.,4
"Fabulous location with wonderful veiws, attentive service, excellent food and lots of sweets at the end of the meal, just what you want for a girly lunch.
We will be going back.",4
"We went to Galvin at Windows for the ¬£35 for 3 courses and a bellini deal.  The view was excellent, waiters attentive and the food was nice - choice of 3 options for each course from a set menu.",3
Galvin at Windows is a spectacular setting. Views are impressive no matter where you sit! Menu look uninspiring but the food was creative and enjoyed by all. The TopTable offer is a great deal. Fabulous wine list. The waiters were numerous and clumsy but not annoyingly so. Would definitely go again.,4
"Terrific views and attentive service.  Food is very good, but it is pricey--",2
"excellent value, beautiful venue.",4
It was a great evening. Great views. A bit pricy when you move away from the offer menu.,4
"Wow - have been to Galvins a few times now and am never disappointed, it is fabulous.  The views, food and staff are excellent.  Highly recommended!!",4
"Galvin at Windows was a great place to eat, nice view of london, great food but bit pricey and good service, i would definetly recomended",3
"Amazing views, excellent service and very good food. A very relaxing and peaceful meal",4
"The Spring lunch deal with Galvin at Windows is a superb opportunity to eat well, and relatively inexpensively, at a great height. The views are spectacular, but this was topped by the attentive service, succulent chicken breast with roasted vine tomatoes and lip-smacking glass of Pommery. Fabulous for a special occassion.",4
"We took an early Saturday dinner at Windows to take advantage of their set menu deal. Service was very attentive as at 5:30pm the resturant wasn't very busy. Really nice addition is that they have an additional wine selection to match the set menu. 
To sum up, lovely food and good service topped off by an amazing view.",3
"What a restaurant! The food was outstanding, a little pricey, but well worth the experience. We had the strawberry panancotta for dessert, this was possibly the best dessert I have ever had! Ooh & lets not forget the amazing views across London......priceless!!!!",3
"galvin at Windows- excellent food and wonderful views. services oustanding.  Only slight criticism is that table for four was slightly too big and therefore difficult speaking with the person opposite, and being a busy Friday night there was always a queue for the two ladies toilets.  Wonderful night and fabulous cocktails.",4
Great lunch date at galvins would recommend.  Nice desserts!,3
"The first place that I have dined with a birds eye view of London, and on the strength of this alone, I would recommend this restaurant. At ¬£35 for 3 courses; a bargain. Wine from ¬£28 helps to rock the price up if you're there for a party! Service was great even if there was some confusion over the ""special"", perhaps a little over the top as I had to ask several times for my empty wine glass not to be taken away. Food portions were not big, but added up nicely. A nice birthday touch was included",4
"A wonderful location, good food and attentive service made my mother's 50th birthday meal an enjoyable experience. The ladies toilets are ridiculously small for the size of restaurant and bar, however overall is was a lovely evening. The restaurant beautifully decorated my mother's desert with birthday wishes and they managed to find us a window table at the bar to wrap a lovely evening up. Recommended as a treat. It's more like ¬£60 per head than ¬£35 but a treat.",3
"the dessert and free chocolates were amazing...the bellini was very tasty also the drinks took a while, but very good fun.",4
The food here is fantastic,4
"Galvin at Windows - sensational views of london and exquisite setting.  Divine food, very tasty indeed, and impressed with service.  Overall had a great dinner, and highly recommend it.",4
"I highly recommend Galvin at Windows.  Great ambience in the restaurant with fantastic views all over London.  The food was excellent, and each dish we ordered came with little surprises on the plate.  Impecable service - our starters were very slightly delayed and we were offered two glasses of champagne on the house.  We will definitely be going back for a return visit.",4
"Galvin at Window's spectacular views over hyde park and london, and the retro decor give this restaurant an ambiance which is hard to beat. Food was of the highest standard, but the selection available on the set menu didn't include what I thought were their best dishes. It seemed that they didn't allow dinners on the top table packeage to take the tables closest to the windows, probably understandale. All in all an excellent location for a fancy meal out, romantic or otherwise.",4
"What a transformation from the old Windows! Tasteful and thoughtful 30's decor coupled with those views make for great ambience. Service is impeccable and we were brilliantly looked after by everyone. Top marks to the sommelier; I asked for a robust Bordeaux around ¬£60 and he guided us to a great Margaux for ¬£52. Food is imaginative and tasty, presentation is perfect but for us, it was the service that we'll remember most. The bar is a great place to unwind after eating. Highly recommended.",4
"Mixed feelings. Very nice food, creative - but not too much, perfect texture, detailed presentation. The service is very quick and attentive. The ambience - too loud and too many people - feels like a big diner. But then there is the view - hard to rival. Dinner for two with wine (by the glass) was J220 - there are a few other places in London where you can get the same level of cooking, quieter ambience and better value - I expected to pay 160-170 for the meal. All in all - a solid 7.",3
First time been to Galvin at Windows...amazing location and the top table set menu was excellent value...food was great with very nice touches such as hand made chocolates with coffee...went to the bar afterwards which has amazing views at night...will be back to try the lunch,4
"I have been a member of Toptable for approx 5 years and this is the first restaurant that I have awarded top marks to. The food was amazing, the service perfect, views spectacular and the atmosphere great. I ate here with a couple of girl friends and from the moment we arrived to the time we left, we did not stop grinning! The overall experience was fabulous. I have nothing but great things to say about Galvin at the Windows and would jump at the chance to eat there again!!!",4
"Galvin at windows was indeed a special treat. we went mondaylunchtime w ith 50% off which was excellent value. superb food, imaginatively presented.They even wrote happy birthday in chocolate for my friend. staff extremely attentive and helpful. views wonderful. cant wait to go back",4
"I went to Galvin at Windows about 2 weeks ago for my boyfriend's birthday.  I had chosen the 2 courses meal deal on Sunday for ¬£19.50 but end up with the 3 courses meal for ¬£25.  I was so pleased with the service they provide.  Sitting next to the window with the best view of London, having the sunday lunch with the best service you can ever imagine, what more you can ask for? After the meal, they surprise me with a birthday treat for my boyfriend too.  This restaurant I will recommend for 10/10",4
"Galvin at Windows was a very nice expericence. The waiters were a little too keen to top up drinks at times but the food and option to go into the bar after made up for this! Overall, great food and well worth a visit.",3
The ¬£35 meal deal was great and made all the better as they gave us a fabulous table for my sister's birthday. It was right by the double height window overlooking Hyde Park. From the 28th floor the view is fantastic. Excellent food and charming table service. Well recommended if you book the ¬£35 deal otherwise the restaurant is pretty pricey.,4
Galvins was a wonderful dining experience with great food and service would highly recommend,3
"Good view. Would have preferred a more quiet/relaxed environment like Tamarai or Rhodes 24.  Waters were attentive, but a bit too much bustling around for me. Lovely place though, food was reasonably tasty, portions are typically minimalist hence the value rating.",3
"Dining at Malmaison, Manchester, we had an excellent meal in the darkened atmospheric surroundings you'd expect from the Malmaison style. I had an excellent steakfrites for what you'd expect for 15 pounds and my girlfriend a superbly cooked whole sole. The creme brulee made the meal though - it was the one of the best I've ever tasted. No major down points to mention, although food took a while to be delivered to say it was early and the restaurant was quiet. Excellent wine selection.",4
An incredible experience at an incredible price. My guests when dining for breakfast at 'Galvin at Windows' were from overseas and were delighted with the expanse view of London. The service at this establishment is exceptional and I will certainly be returning for another meal.,4
"Unfortunately the set menu wasn't to our taste at all, so we had the a la carte menu!  The restaurant was amazing, food delicious and service first class.....just a little more than I was expecting to pay!!!  But as a treat, well worth it!",4
If you want to treat yourself to a great 'posh' restaurant with a great view and great food and without feeling to embarassed that you haven't got money falling out of your pockets then this is ideal.,3
"Once again Galvins provided excellent service and fab food, for a great value deal. We had a baby in a pushchair and they were extremely accomodating and child friendly as well. Fantastic for a sunday lunch!",4
"The veiws from Galvin at windows are wonderful.  The special offer memu and the food were good and the waiters friendly and attentive, but not in an overpowering way.",4
Galvin at Windows is a lovely place to go for breakfast.  The 27th floor view overlooking Hyde Park is unbeatable.  The food is very reasonably priced for breakfast and of high quality.  The smoked salmon and scrambled eggs is delicious.  Staff is friendly but almost too attentive (pacing about can be quite unsettling at times) but the view is so lovely it offsets any slight imperfections in your dining experience.,4
"The bar, food and views were all excellent.  There was an abundance of waiters - although the service was excellent, this made us feel as though we were being rushed, and a different waiter appeared seemingly every few minutes - be it with bread, water, wine, amuse bouche, checking all was ok.  That would be our only criticism of an otherwise excellent evening.  The sommelier was very knowledgeable - suggested wines complimented the food perfectly. My husband's lamb was the best he's ever eaten.",4
"Another excellent evening at Galvin @ Windows; a 2 hour turnaround on the table was handled well though a similar meal without this restriction had felt a little less rushed. Food, wine and service still superb.",4
"Fantastic view, Impeccable service with food to match.
Cannot fault, all you could wish for.",4
"Lunch at Galvin at Windows was simply a delightful experience. From the moment we arrived everything was quietly efficient, courteous and friendly. The layout of the restaurant is very effective in that despite there being quite a lot of other diners we did not feel surrounded by them and we could also hear each other talking at normal levels - not always possible in many restaurants today!  It was wonderful to feel we had been allowed to lunch at a leisurely pace and not just 'turned around'.",4
"Had a great evening at Galvins at Windows for my girlfirend's birthday. Got a table right by the window and had a fantastic view over Hyde Park. 
Food was really nice and staff were helpful but sometimes felt they were almost being too formal, could have smiled a little more",3
"Excellent food and great service, again!!",3
Great value food and very high standnards!,4
"Excellent lunch at Galvin @ Windows, opted for the ¬£25 for three courses inc a glass of Champagne. Immaculate service, never felt like we were being punished for steering clear of the a la carte menu. Lots of little extras, a super French red for around ¬£20. Having spent ¬£180 a head on a previous visit the set menu is wonderful value. Highly recommended",4
"Galvn at Windows at the Hilton Park Lane has to be one of the best dining experiences in London.  Predominently glass and 28 floors up, the views, style and decor are uplifting.  Both service and  staff were unfaultable and the food was both top quality and delicious.  All in all the 'pre-theatre' menu for ¬£19.50 (set 3 course) was great value as was the wine accompanying the menu @ ¬£14.00.  Also a good selection of delicious cocktails and pre-dinner aperitifs in the classy bar.",4
"Galvin at Windows must be the best location for a restaurant in London, you'd pay for the views alone, but food and sevvice superb too.",4
"Wonderful surroundings, a spectacular view and delicious food. The service was excellenf (not too intrusive) and I would highly recommend going there. However, ask for a window seat!",3
"Galvin@windows is one restaurant that one should go even just for the stunning views of london but apart from this the ambience (even at lunchtime), the food and service was very good indeed. Gents make sure you get your ladies up there.",3
Galvin at Windows is a great location with great views of London. Food and service good.,3
"Great place and very good service. The food was just a little too salty for my taste, having said that I'll be going there again.",4
Galvin at Windows served very good food but nothing blew me away.  Great views though and a very reasonably priced wine list.,2
"Visited Galvin at Windows on Saturday evening. Best part was the view overlooking the Park and lake. The food was good but nothing to rave about, the service was excellent and freebies very tasty. The wine,water, coffee and after dinner drinks in the bar made the bill over ¬£150 for two of us.",3
Galvins at windows has the most beautiful views over London.The service is superb and courses well timed and beautifully presented.It is definitely worth booking for a special occasion!,4
"Lovely by day, but it really comes into its' own at night - this restaurant has stunning views across London, so if conversation dries up you can always look at the scenery!! The interior decor is gentle on the eyes.  The lighting is intimate and designed to flatter women.  Oh, yes! and the food is absolutely superb, served by knowledgeable and unobtrusive waiting staff.  Not cheap, but worth every penny! If you want to impress, go to Galvin at Windows.",4
"Everything about our visit to Galvin at Windows was excellent.  Staff were friendly, food was excellent and the views across London spectacular.  The ¬£25 menu for three courses with a glass of pink champagne was very good value indeed for this standard and location.",4
"Galvin at windows,2nd visit,excellent location ,food & service
same quality as Galvins baker street.",4
"Galvin's at Windows never fails. The food, service, wine, view is perfect. Enjoyed by all.",4
Galvin at Windows is very special. There is the quality of food and service which can be expected from Galvin together with beautifully furbished surroundings and stunning view across London.,4
"Friday 18th April I finally managed to get to the Galvin at Windows resturant at the Hilton Park Lane.  4 years I have been meaning to visit there however for some reason it hadn't materialised.  It certainly was worth the wait, the view was stunning, service faultless and food delightful.  I would highly recommend.",4
This was first visit to Galvin at Windows. The lunch service and food was excellent and good value.,4
Worth it just for the view - go at sunset...,4
"Waiting staff very formal, would have prefered to be left a little longer between constant attention. Would say this would be a one perhaps twice experience",2
"Went to Galvin for my husband's birthday. Great value with the TT offer. The service was impeccable, best I've had in a London restaurant! Only gripe was that they didn't give us a window table or anything to mark my husband's birthday, despite a request at the time of booking. Recommended for a romantic meal, especially after dark!",3
At Windows even with the limited spring menu we had considerable trouble choosing what to have as it all sounded so good. Whilst the service was good we were served by at least 10 different staff which made it slightly impersonal.,4
"Take advantage of the Toptable offer! Food was fantastic. However, 3 courses from the ala carte menu for only ¬£58 is also a fantastic price given the quality of the food. Will definitely go back and make this my group's Sunday brunch place.",4
"Service was good - too good; we were rushed to our table so couldn't enjoy the view with a cocktail. The sommelier was very unhappy about our decision to get a bottle of red though most of us were eating fish. Food was very hit and miss - main courses were cold and tasteless, but starters and dessert were better. definitely not worth the touristy prices!",2
"Galvin at Windows was excellent.  Great view, great food, great service.  Recommended",3
"Galvin at Windows is a  lovely restaurant. The food was amazing, the service was excellent and the view was great.",4
"A fantastic restaurant. The food was excellent, and the 3 courses for ¬£25 was outstanding value for money, especially along with all the sweets and treats brought out at the end. The service was excellent and the staff very attentive. Initially we were going to be seated in the centre of the restuarant, however the maitre d' asked if we prefered a table right by the main window, which we greatfully accepted. The views over Hyde Park are outstanding. All in all a throughly enjoyable lunch.",4
"Sunday lunch at Galvin at Windows did not disappoint!  Not only was the food incredibly good value for the quality of the dishes but the addition of a free glass of champagne was an added bonus.  The service was faultless.  Indeed, a mistake was made with the wine we ordered but they let us keep the wine brought in error along with the correct one!  We enjoyed the free extra sweet delicacies at the end of the meal, too! A beautiful setting with fantastic views over London.  Highly recommended!!",4
"Galvin at windows was unfaultable especially with the special offer! The food was very good, wine very good, service very attentive, lovely views and pleasant surrounds. Will be going back again.",4
Everything about the restaurant from toliets to the view to the food to the staff is amazing - i will be eating here again and strongly recommend.,4
Excellent service. Great food but very limited choice if you've a veggie. Great views. Excellent restaurant for a special occasion. Still want to try the Lunchtime offering.,4
"Absolutey superb lunch at Galvins -- excellent food and superb service. The lamb shoulder was done to a t, and although we somehow ""forgot"" to order some potatoes, probably too busy looking at the view ... the potatoes were duly delivered and did not detract from the meal. Of course its a little bit pricey with wine, but even then, Id say it was worth the extra money. Definitely return for a special occasion.",4
"We really enjoyed our evening at Galvin at Windows. We had never been there before and were very impressed by the view. The decor is also very nice - low lighting, comfortable chairs, space between tables. The service was excellent- all of the waiters were attentive and friendly. The sommelier was particularly impressive and introduced us to some excellent (and unusual) wines. The food was very good. The only downside was the fact that the air-conditioning was on too high for a restaurant.",4
"From the minute we walked in we felt special, the views are sensational and the staff made us feel that they were thrilled that we were there. We were able to ask questions without feeling uncomfortable and the food both looked and tasted delicious.",4
"Galvin at Windows was lovely, the service was excellent and the value was excellent for pre theatre. The only downside was the lack of choices on the fixed menu but what we had was excellent. Will take visitors back for the amazing view",4
"Took my husband here on his birthday and we had a great evening. Food was excellent, although I had serious food envy when I saw his fois gras starter! The sea bass was to die for. Will be going again.",4
"Galvin at Windows, you pay for the stunning setting and top service and food.  agreat 'special occasion'.  the special offer is good value but you will proably be tempted like me to upgrade once there. House wine is excellent value.",3
"I took my father for lunch at Galvin at Windows and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The service was excellent, the food was great and the views across London were sensational. We both had two courses and a glass of pommery for less than ¬£20! the choices on the menu were pretty good, we both had the foie gras for starters and I had the duck, my opinion they were great - my dad had the pollack, agin he thought it was great! A great lunchtime venue, could easily take friends and clients to dine!",4
We had the pre-theatre menu at Galvin at Windows. The set menu had limited choice but everything that we ordered was excellent! Excellent value and a great time to visit Windows as we saw the sunset!,4
"Fantastic location, the view over London is amazing. The food was spot on and it was very refreshing to have toilets with NO attendants! I would advise you to make the most of the offer, unlike me!",3
The meal at Galvin at Windows was excellent. We had the special offer menu and it was very good value for money. We had a great view and the service was also very good.,4
Faultless .... I can not rate Galvins highly enough. Superb food with service almost as incredible as the views.,3
"i dined last night at galvin and enjoyed it. we arrived a bit after 10 so we were told we couldnt have the 8-course menu  and settled for the 3 course one. i had the rabbit as a starter, delicious and melted in my mouth. my main was beef which was good but not special. my gf had beetroot salad and seabass, both impressed her. desserts were pretty good.service was very helpful. ampience is ok. both wines i was suggested were dissapointing. overall great food, bit overpriced in line with london.",3
"I was disappointed with Galvin at Windows.  The food was fairly good, but nowhere near as good as one would expect for the price we paid!  There was also only a choice of the 3 course menu or the tasting menu, no real a la carte.",2
"Although slightly limited on the special set menu, Malmaison made for a very pleasant lunch indeed.  We were a large group and well acommodated without being rushed.  Sometimes the service needed a little prompting  - for example one of the options was not available on the set menu (leaving only 2 choices) but they didn't offer an alternative without us asking for one.  For the quality of food and set menu price though, it really was excellent value for money.",3
Malmaison Manchester proved a relaxing evening - interesting selection of local food and wine and no pressure on a Saturday night to clear the table.  Lemon sponge was a bit dry though!,3
"Galvins at Windows has the fine dining experience down to a tee. The service is impeccable, be prepared to be pampered! the food is just fantastic, I highly recommend the chocolate dessert. The views are specucular, definitely asked to be seated by the window. If you're looking for a romantic place for a special occassion, this most certainly is it!",4
"Galvin at Windows was a great experience, made affordable with the toptable deal. The views are lovely, the food was very good (with excellent touches like complimentary amuse bouche, chocolates and friands after dessert). The service was almost a little over-attentive, but overall I'd definitely recommend, especially for a special occasion.",4
"Birthday lunch at Galvin at Windows. Very good food, excellent attentive, but not over the top service. Very nice ambience and views. Highly recommended.",4
Had the fresh and local menu from the brasserie - really nice to try something new and guaranteed fresh from the area,4
The views from the 28th floor restaurant at Galvin at Windows are spectacular. The food was excellent and with the Top Table deal the bill was reasonable.,3
Galvins was everything I expected it to be and more. Faultless service although a bit too attentive sometimes but the food was not only delectable but an artform on a plate and as for the peanut butter parfait oh my oh my! Loved it all and the venue itself is stunning with breathtaking views all around. A must for anyone wanting a real treat.,4
Galvin at Windows - service was attentive during the meal and the food fine for the level of restaurant. However we were rushed out of the restaurant following our dessert to have our coffees in the makeshift bar area. This was appalling as they did not move the drinks we were drinking at our table. Instead they cleared the drinks we were still drinking away! The waiters also often congregated just behind our table to discuss orders which affected the ambience.,3
Galvin at Windows is the perfect place to take your loved one if you want to impress them; the food was delicious and the view equally stunning. A very good lunch indeed,4
"This was a Christmas get together for a group of girlfriends.  The service was a bit lacking at times, but they didn't adhere to the 2 hour turnaround on the table which suited us.  Also they would only let us pay with 4 cards, there were 5 of us and it was a quite large bill - bit strange.  Other than that the food was fantastic and the location and view make it a very good evening.  Would definately recommmend.",3
"Galvin at Windows is an amazing place to dine simply for its great panoramic views across the london sky line, we have had drinks at the bar there many times, the service is always  good but quite expensive, we decided to try the restaurant, when we arrived exactly on time of our reservation we asked if we could have a drink a the bar before going to our table but we were asked not to and were rushed to our table it was quite draughty where we were seated my friend kept her coat on for the night",2
"WE had an excellent meal at Galvin at Windows in a superb environment. Wine is not cheap, but it is what you would expect at a restaurant and venue of this quality",4
Galvin at Windows was amazing for breakfast! Expensive but not extortionate. Fantastic food quality and great service!,4
"No doubt I would recommend the Galvin-Hilton Park Lane. The Top Table offer is Fabulous, the service excellent and the view stunning. The Restaurant is on the way of ""hopefully"" reiceiving their first Michelin so they do their best to offer excellent service and providing beautiful food. I can only say ""fabulous"" my friends and I had a good time.",4
"Galvin at Windows:
The sevrice was very good except the maitre d - who seemed to try and talk to you for the sake of it (often when we were in mid conversation).
The view is great and it was a good experience venue.  
Apparantly only two toilets in the ladies (shared with the bar) which meant queques for the ladies.
Overall so so and not amazing value even with the offer.",3
would recommend going there with the offer 3 courses for 35 ounds,4
"I took my girlfriend to Galvin at Windows for her birthday, and it proved a pefect choice. The venue is beautiful with stunning views over London, and we were seated perfectly to take full advantage of these. The food was sublime, and the staff very attentive. This is not somewhere you want to visit if you are looking for a cheap meal though! Even with the toptable offer and  a bottle of wine the bill will exceed ¬£100. Considering the occasion, though, I was happy to pay. I recommend the cheese!",4
We had the locally sourced 2 course lunch for ¬£14.95. Our friendly waitress (also locally sourced) was very knowlegeable about local farm producers and gave good advice about the limited choices available.  The food whilst rather dull-chesse on toast starter- mutton chops or fish pie main course- was good and fresh.  The wine list was extensive and very expensive but the choice of a ¬£16 Merlot from Chile (always a safe bet) appeased a rather supercilious sommelier.  Comfortable but not inspiring,3
"Mal Maison Brasserie, Manchester - Straight 10's once again! Small 21st birthday celebration, private room, lovely flower table decorations, excellent service from friendly & knowledgeable staff. An evening to remember. Thanks!",4
"Galvin at Windows is very impressive, would have been nice to have the requested window table but did book at short notice. Food was beautifully presented and service excellent. We had a very enjoyable evening and would recommend  - just be aware that the prices are fairly high. ¬£58 for 3 courses.",4
"Disappointment! at the very least! We suffered ordinary food, insensitive service that was blunt and dismissive, waiters that routinely interupt dinner conversation, and overall very poor value despite paying full price for the fare. Toilet floors were dirty, we were met at the door by a bouncer who told us where to put our coats before we were made welcome, stern demands from waitstaff...the view is the only reason to visit and is not sufficient reason to go back! - you lose, Galvin.",1
malmaison manchester. Good food and very lively for a Tuesday evening. Steak-frites was excellent and a good selection of wines. The cheese trolley offered pleanty of choice. Service was very friendly but vvveeerrrryyyy ssslllloooowwww.,3
"Galvin at Windows was a thoroughly pleasant dinner experience for my girlfriend and I. Having pre-booked the 3 courses + Bellini for ¬£35 deal, we were a little concerned that service may not be as it would have had we ate a la carte. On the contrary, the welcome and service we had was slick and surpisingly warm.  The surroundings are stylish and modern, managing to be luxurious without coming across as too stuffy or formal. The food was sumptious without being too fussy.  Well worth a visit.",3
Food and service was excellent - with the dessert being the highlight of the meal (Baileys creme brulee)As we were celebrating a birthday they were kind enough to bring out a special birthday treat which made the evening even more special.,4
Staff were all very friendly and attentive. Nice to go to a good restaurant and not be treated like a 2nd class citizen for using a special offer! Amazing view of London. Nice for any occasion. Thoroughly enjoyable evening.,3
I had a wonderful birthday at Galvin. The service was attentive but relaxed. We had a choice of the promotional or a la carte menu but were treated no differently when we opted for the cheaper. It would have been good value if we hadn't been so adventurous with the wine list! A really nice touch was my dessert which arrived with a personal message.,3
"Once again an excellent effort by the chefs and staff at Mal Maison Brasserie, Manchester. This offer applies to their home grown & locally sourced ingredients menu so it can be quite limited but I have noticed that the menu has changed since my first and second visits. Another plus side of this smaller menu... it encourages you to try new things. I had the mutton chops with crushed potatoes and pearl barley. Simple & scrumptious. Chocolate and chestnut cheesecake - divine. Service - EXCELLENT!",4
"would recommend, the view is amazing!",3
"Galvin at Windows was a superb venue for a birthday dinner.  We requested a window-side table in our Toptable booking and were given one.  The service and food were top-class.  All in all, a memorable night.",4
Excellent food and terrific views. Worth a visit on Toptable offer.,4
Galvin at Windows is a good restaurant for a special occasion. We had the tasting menu with matching wines so it was a very expensive meal. Prices are very high. We enjoyed most courses but there was just too much. Service was very good. It was a perfectly nice meal but did not wow us.,3
"Dining at Galvin at Windows was a really fantastic experience. We were given a table right at the windows with beautiful views over london at night, the decor is stunning and the service was great. More to the point the food was amazing, a real food lovers treat! Obviously very expensive normally but well worth going with the deal!",4
"Galvin at Windows is a fantastic venue with exceptional service, great food and views all over London.  I would highly recommend the restaurant if you havent been already",4
"Malmaison Brasserie, Manchester - utterly mediocre - we took a friend here today for her 30th birthday and wished we hadn't.  We weren't greeted for ages, despite there only being 3 tables occupied. Wine arrived before pre-lunch drinks.  The menu was truly mediocre - caesar salad and salmon amongst the starters; steak+chips, fishcakes and full english breakfast for main courses.  Service was slow and staff uninterested in guests' wellbeing. Will not return.",1
"We were not offered the 3 course deal and so although the food at Windows was great, it was unbelievably expensive!",3
"We went to Galvin at Windows expecting something remotely similar to the sample menu online, but unfortunately the special menu there was of a theme - 'innards and heads'.  Luckily my husband is French, as the menu was a weird array of french and english words mixed up; he steered me away from the ' tete veau' entree, we went a la carte instead.  Other diners closeby seemed to be disappointed - you had to like eating heads, stomachs and cheeks of various animals. Staff were very attentive though",3
"Galvin at Windows was a special treat for our wedding anniversary. We opted for the menu gourmand but found that the food, whilst delicious, didn't seem to have any coherence to it - there was little subtlety, the flavours seemed to clash with each other and many dishes were over-salted. The cost of the meal was eye-watering too - if we go back again I think we'll dine a la carte rather than go for the special menu.",3
Went to malmaison brasserie for lunch last week and it was good. the service was good and food was tasty.,2
"I have been to Galvins a couple of times and have generally found the food to be of a high quality and great views in swanky surroundings. Unfortunately, the set menu offer in Galvins is not representative of the quality of food in the ala carte menu.",3
"amazing views, the bar was a great place to start. couldn't find an entree I liked off the set menu, but all the mains and desserts looked and tasted divine.",3
"Galvin at Windows was blessed with stunning views, going on a clear autumn lunch time was lovely. Food was generally good, but not wonderful, my soup starter (butternut squash)was wonderful but red mullet, with paella and bone marrow jus was rather strongly fishy and too much of a blend of flavours on the plate.",3
"We had a fantastic evening at Galvin at Windows. The service was amazing, at one point, we had a waiter each. The food was lovely and the toptable deal really was good value for money. I have to say the best thing was the cocktails in the bar looking out over London.",4
"Galvin at Windows - Despite a horrid day weather wise (you could only just see the ground!) and excellent lunch. The waiters were efficient and yet  informal, the food exquisite and the wine sublime. If you do order the Tarte Tatin for 2 though - keep in mind it could easily serve 4!!",3
"This is my second visit - the food is wonderful, the staff are very friendly and accommodating.  The view is great and just gets better as the darkness falls.  I will definately be returning and recommending it to friends.",4
"Galvins at Windows has unarguably THE BEST view in London, which was the only reason that took me back to try the restaurant after visiting the bar.  But dinner at the restaurant was disappointing.  Food was okay (not good value though), service was very rushed and some of the waiters wasn't very polite.  The special offer menu wasn't great so we ended up ordering from the normal menu which really hit our pockets.",2
"Went to Galvins with the ¬£35/person deal. Well worth it: quality & presentation of food was superb, views were stunning. Liked the fact that we weren't rushed out from our table, even though we did drift over the prescribed '2 hr' slot our ¬£35 deal allocates.
Would recommend, particularly with the ¬£35 deal.",3
"We had a wonderful time at Galvin at Windows. The top table deal was good value. I didn't feel like we were treated second class because of the deal, quite the opposite! We started with a gorgeous muse buche - goats cheese and tomato, a delicious butternut squash soup followed by baby chicken, with onion tart and spinach and the desserts were to die for! Then chocolates, poppy seed cake and finally home made marshmallows. We felt truly spoilt! We were very impressed. Highly recommend it!",4
"The service made us feel like we were royalty, waited on hand and foot (without it being over the top annoying).  The food was amazing and our OJ and coffees were constantly topped up and it was very generous with their servings of food.  The views were amazing - pity it wasn't a blue sky - but definitely worth the visit on toptable deal!!  Cant wait for the next deal to go again!",4
"Galvin at Windows was fantastic in all respects - the view and service being the most immediate (and very positive!) with the food then cementing an amazing evening.  Be warned, petit fours are continuous so leave room!",4
Although we had to have an early dinner at Galvins as we were going to the theatre our order was handled very efficiently and politely. The meal was delicious and the views stunning. A truly unique experience. diners should note that the drinks prices in the bar are eye-watering so if you want to have some pre dinner drinks you may need to have deep pockets!,3
"We absolutely love the menu gourmand at Windows, and the beautiful selection of wines that come with each course.

Last night's meal wasn't quite up to the spectacular standards of previous visits, but was still of the highest class and the staff as ever were perfect, making sure everything was to our liking without ever being intrusive.

Brilliant.",3
"Firstly Galvin at Windows is a beautiful venue for diner.  Your on the 28th floor overlooking the north, south or east of London, WOW! The service is top although there were occations when we saw and heard the staff being told off, which wasn't nice as they trya so hard.  The food was amazing, great flavours and decent portions, the diner menu is good value although i had ala carte as my girlfriend can't eat read meat. Cocktails were gorgeous in the bar afterwards. This was for my 25th, perfect.",4
I have marked the service down solely because when we first arrived the staff were over-attentive.  The restaurant was not busy and my friend and I felt unable to have a chat as there was constantly someone fussing round us.  Once the restaurant got busier the service was less intrusive.  We had a lovely meal with great views over London and I would definitely go back.,3
We went to Galvin at Windows on a Tuesday night and had a very pleasant experience. The views over London at night are stunning. Good food and probably the best service we've experienced in London. Excellent value for money with the toptable offer.,4
Good ambience and an interesting range of dishes (though set menu fairly limited).  Excellant value for money for the quality of food and cooking.  Probably more suited to couples/small groups than a large rowdy party.  Only small criticism would be that some of the tables are too close together.  Highly recommended regardless.,4
"We dined at Galvins at Windows last night (24 Aug) on the special top table set menu offer and had a wonderful time. Great food with lots of extra amuse bouches. Seafood bisque and sea bass v fresh and flavourful. Marshmallows were great. Service v down to earth and waiters could not do enough for us. Great ambience, view better at night when lights come on. Highly recommended.",4
"It was a perfect meal for a special event.  My guest had been posted to London for four years and this was the perfect venue for the panoramic London view. Food and ambience made the evening.  Final cost was on the high side, even with the offer, as the wine and any extras push the price up. eg a pot of peppermint tea was ¬£9, but we got petit fours with it.  Would go again as a special treat.",4
"I took a group of friends from work, we all loved the venue and the food was great.  The staff were very attentive and friendly - highly recommend it!",4
"as a yearly birthday ritual, I treated my best pal to a birthday breakfast at Galvins at Window restaurant.  It was absolutely wonderful.  The waiters were very attentive, tasty food, fab weather and spectacular view of London.  Most importantly the ladies toilets were very stylish!!!!  I would most certainly go back for another luxurious breakfast!",3
My husband and myslef dines at 'Galvin at windows'  and the experience was lovely. The staff were very friendly and attentive and the food great. The views from this restaurant on a lovely summer's evening is next to none. ask for a table by the large windows. Recommended for teh price and service,4
DEFINATELY TO BE RECOMMENDED.,4
"Fantastic views at Galvin at windows and good value for money. Service was good although a bit 'in your face'. Felt slightly uncomfortable at times due to waiters constanty hovering around the table! Overall, would definitely recommend it for a special ocassion.",3
Great views from a window seat at Galvins were interupted by overattentive service. Food was good but I almost choked on clingfilm which hadn't been removed from my mackerel before it was served. When the bill arrived we decided to deduct a small percent from the service charge to express our annoyance at being served clingfilm. The girl taking our card refused to charge us anything less than the full service charge despite us explaining 3 times. Not a good end to the evening.,3
"Great great great great great. First time there, and I have been to most of the 'well known' London restaurants, but dinner at Galvin at Windows was out of this World. Food was amazing, staff were great and view was superb. Exceeded my expectations.",4
"Galvin at Windows. Fantastic ambience, amazing views,  great service. Staff were excellent in dealing with some issues. Only regrettable point: an incorrect bill took a while to deal with and we missed our train - did not get home until 02.00h in the morning. Would still highly recommend",4
"The food was good, very tasty and not too adventurous. The offer we had was a set menu using ingredients from the local area which I was pleased to see. The menu had details of where certain products were purchased from and write-ups of how some of these products are produced. The service was average, the staff were very friendly and were very accomodating when we decided to dine later than planned. The restaurant was a little dusty - needed little spring clean!",2
"Malmaison Brasserie - Manchester is a bit pretentious, The set menu in the offer doesn't give a great choice either, It's all a bit novelty service really (pate served in a lidded pot and sole goujons  in a chip basket) i almost laughed out loud.
OK for a bit of fun",3
"Galvins was an excellent venue for a very nice meal with great views. The staff were welcoming, attentive without being overbearing, and the food was of high quality, the only disappointment was that the main course was good but nothing amazing. Definitely worth a visit on the TT deal, not sure I'd go without the deal.",3
Galvin at Windows provided an excellent venue to celebrate my Boyfriends 30th Birthday.  The service was attentive but not evasive and the food and the views over London provided the perfect way to spend this special evening.,4
"Malmaison Staff not helpful and very slow
Food average and the set menu good value",2
"went there for breakfast, and although the view and service was wonderful, the food wasn't too impressive.",3
"Wonderful food at Windows, great service, didn't feel that we were given any lesser degree of service because we were on the toptable deal. Even got a table by the window on request! Only downside is that drinks are very expensive - ¬£13.50 for what are very small cocktails does rack up the bill somewhat, despite the great food deal. Would recommend highly, but don't expect to pay anything less that ¬£120 for 2.",3
Great service and great food. Were unfortunately disturbed a bit by a large group celebrating someones 18th birthday. Could have done without that party. The 35GBP offer is a great deal.,3
"Galvin at Windows was a fantastic venue for this specila occassion. The staff were very attentive, the food was top quality and the free champagne cocktail and bread and petit fours and lemon bread made it great value for money. The only down side was that the drinks were very expenxive and a glass of wine and cocktail and bottle of water cost more than one of the meals!",3
"We went to Galvin for the birthday of my girlfriend and we both really liked it: the food was sophisticated and tasty, you really feel in a gastronomic restaurant. The service was OK, sometimes a bit too pushy. The best thing is definitively the view over the Park which made the dinner special and romantic. I highly recommend this place for specific events.",3
We were given a table with a view of Hyde Park & N London. The starters were very good.  The service top notch.  The wine sommelier was excellent and recommended a fair price wine.  The main course was a tale of two cities.  My husbands lamb was done as he likes it.  Red mullet/black olive sauce was fair.  3 pieces come stacked the top were edible.  The bottom piece & the veg were way too salty.  The deserts were very good the cheese is served from a cart which is well worth the extrra $6.,3
"Fabulous views, brilliant service and excellent ambience makes it a great evening.",4
Excellent food although the drinks were overpriced. Would definitely go back and recommend to others.,3
"Took my partner there for her birthday and Galvin was definately suitable for celebrating a special occasion, service was excellent and I was expecting the bill to be worse than it was!",4
Service was faultless and certainly made me smile as they were all so friendly and courteous. Certainly added to the enjoyment. Excellent top table deal and the little extra desserts/ chocs you receive compliments of the chef etc just add that little special touch. I eat out a lot in London and this is one of my most memorable evenings. Views are spectacular as I booked especially for the sunset! Remember to check sunset times on the internet before you book! Drinks in the bar a bella ending!,4
"Galvin at Windows is a pleasant restaurant with a nice view. The food was quite good, although selection is limited with the Tabletop offer. Service very attentive. We had an early dinner at 6 pm and the place felt relaxing and quiet. It was getting a bit noisier after 7 pm.",3
"Galvin at Windows is glorious! Amazing views, beautiful food, and the top table deal makes it good value - the downside is the wine - gorgeous but cheapest bottle is ¬£29!! It's an expensive treat, a visit here but worth it in my opinion!",3
"The 6pm sitting gave us three courses for ¬£35 each. We indulged in the Sommelier's recommendation for a Rhone Valley white and were not disappointed. Arriving early for two champagnes put the cost up to ¬£100 each. Worth it; a spectacular view, rich and complex food with wine to match, and expert service. The latter would have been better if we had not been forgotten at the bar whilst waiting for our table. But this is a minor quibble.",3
"Great Food and service, unfortunately we didn't get the table next to the window.  I would go again but next time ask for a table next to the window.",3
Food was exceptional; not as rich as most modern French restaurants; food and service were impeccable; stunning views over London and a bar to die for!,4
"Fantastic food, service and ambience. A real treat.",3
"Excellent food, a lovely atmosphere only slightly let down by less than attentive service.  We'd go back again though.",3
"Galvin at Windows was a great experience.  On arrival, the restaurant was quite quiet so we were able to get a table with a window view.  We selected dishes from the A la carte menu at ¬£58 pp and were both pleased with our selection.  I definately recommended the Tarte tatin for 2.  The service was great and the staff very friendly, maybe a little too attentive.  If you are happy for the sommelier to make recommendations on the wine take them, however I would check the price as you may get stung",3
"We were staying here at MalMaison Manchester for Christmas shopping, nice room, great bar, excellent very well trained staff, food nicely presented BUT Smoked Salmon Gravalax and Turkey were bland!",3
We were given a table by the window with spectacular views across London.  We did find though that the main course came up too soon after the starters.   I can recommend the Chateau Briand.,4
steak dry - no atmosphere,2
"Ate off Malmaison special lunch menu, superb food, brilliant wine list - worth the trip to Manchester + my daughter's amazing company!",3
"Wow!  Amaxing views & excellent food & service.  Celebrated our wedding anniversary, bill came to  ¬£200 with 3 courses & drinks.  Worth it for a special occasion.",4
It was a really nice place and the staff are friendly. The menu was limited for Sunday and a little pricey.,3
"We had the lunch time menu, which was really good value for money, however my chicken wasn't properly cooked and the waiter all but pushed us out the door in his keen-ness for a speedy turn around",2
Great view of London & nice food!  Be prepared to pay a lot of money for the meal - approx ¬£100 pp.  Worth it for special occassions.,3
We were never noticed if the waitlist was actually accepted. It‚Äôs very misleading. But just as well - party of 6 took the business somewhere else.,0
Never was contacted off the waitlist. Didn‚Äôt get seated.,0
"The new setup is horrible. No tables, no food, standing room only, unfriendly exhausted bartenders, and $26 for 1 casamigos - without the tip. I really enjoyed this rooftop YEARS AGO when they first opened. They use to have tables, sofas, and loungers throughout the space and it was a great spot for a cocktail and apps. The owners have clearly gotten greedy. They care nothing about your experience and only want to pack this place with as many people as they can who will pay an insane amount of money for a drink before they realize it's not worth the overcrowded view and leave. They did have a few small tables in the corner that required a seperate reservation but despite that area being completely empty while I was there, we still couldn't access and had to stand shoulder to shoulder with other patrons while trying to enjoy my $30 cocktail without getting shoved or spilling it.",1
$20+ drinks.  No food/snacks. Our server was great though!,2
"They didn‚Äôt even let us in at 10:15pm, even though the bar gets closed at midnight.",0
"There aren't too many rooftop bars in Boston, so when it's a beautiful day out any one of them will be packed. Views from here are great, and good music. Just be prepared to wait 20+ minutes to get a drink.",1
"I loved the atmosphere and views of this place, plus the location is ideal! I unfortunately didn‚Äôt receive the most warm service and although i put in the special request notes that it was my birthday nothing was done. I also wasn‚Äôt aware brunch was only on weekends which i would recommend making more clear on the website if possible in case people make brunch plans on a weekday ! thank you!",2
This is a cool place to have brunch. Great harbor and city views. Food was pretty good albeit a little expensive. Cocktails are very expensive. We just did wine and mimosa. We had indoor high top seats which still had a great view. I think the igloos were really cool but they hold larger parties and we were only 2. I think this would be beautiful at night as well. From the photos I‚Äôve seen it looks great. I don‚Äôt know if we absolutely needed a reservation as it wasn‚Äôt too busy Sunday around noon but as the afternoon goes on it definitely picks up. Looks like all lot of people just grabbed drinks and stood out on the balcony. So that‚Äôs an option too. It wasn‚Äôt too noisy or crowded. Staff were friendly.,3
"Not the most talented bartender, menu is super limited.",2
Cute loved it,3
"Excellent Staff, as always!",4
It was so much fun for my friends and I. We loved staying in one of the igloo‚Äôs. The Buffet appetizer table is definitely the best part. We were almost to full to order off the menu. I highly recommend and will be back.‚ù§Ô∏è,4
My drink was not too good. It was a pistachio martini. They made me another one. Food was okay. I couldn't book a later time and notice that the place was not crowed at all later on. It was a good experience.,4
Went for brunch and sat in the igloo. It was kitschy and the food could have been a lot better. Was awkward to eat in the igloo because the music was too loud and the table was way too low.,2
"The food was low quality - they didn't even have chips. We found hair on my plate on the pizza. The food is served with plastic utensils even though the food is super expensive. The meal sizes are small, the drinks are served in plastic cups that are dirty. The servers were like they were doing the work as a hobby - they lack seriousness. Overall it was a terrible experience even though the place has a great location and has a great potential under good owners.",0
There was a snow storm and we call to cancel 10 times and they never answered,0
"Food was served with plastic silverware. French toast was quite good, but the avocado toast was small and not that much avocado . Nice views but not worth it for brunch",1
We went for brunch and the views were decent but the food was mediocre. Service was slow and we ate with plastic utensils and trays. Probably a better late night spot than a brunch spot.,1
It was an amazing place to go to! The vibe there was great!,4
"Drinks are very expensive there. We went for brunch and they were more expensive than the food! We ordered a breakfast sandwich that came with fries and we were extra charged for the fries! I wouldn‚Äôt mind to pay for fries as long as they communicate that to me. I had a reservation that I paid 50usd upfront, the amount was not applied on my check. The view is nice, that‚Äôs all. Would never recommend this place for food or even drinks.",1
"The view was absolutely amazing. I‚Äôd come back for the view but the food is average and the service wasn‚Äôt great.

They didn‚Äôt get us water and did not approach us for 15min after we had already been seated so I had to go and ask about service.",3
Service was horrible no one came to serve us while we waited for a while.,0
"Clam chowder fries were unbelievable 
Harry & Staff were flawless",3
"Excellent in terms of ambience, prompt in service but food options are not that great. A wide of cocktails are available though.",4
"Disappointing, not fancy, plastic cups and disposable utensils. The view is good but the rest is not",1
It was a great place to be during covid as we were 1 of only 2 groups in the restaurant. Beautiful view of the city indoors. Service was great. The brunch menu is a bit limited but the food was delicious.,2
Terrible for brunch. Go for drinks.,0
Incredible experience,4
Horrible service and food,0
Food isn't great and a bit pricey. Definitely paying for the view which is beautiful. They also do not validate parking which I wish I knew ahead of time since they list several lots on the website.,2
Awesome brunch service. Definitely will be back.,4
"I seriously do not know why this place has mixed reviews. This place was amazing! Very accommodating with my reservation.. they did everything I requested.  Very friendly staff, the drinks and food were good. I mean if people are surprised by the prices.. I mean come on people it‚Äôs a city and a popular bar what do you expect?? Definitely would suggest this bar for a date night, night on the town or a special occasion. Thank you Lookout Rooftop!",4
"The view is nice but the drinks are way too weak to be $17 and the food tasted like it came out of the microwave. This is a cheap college bar disguised with an overpriced menu because of the view/location. Take my advice, eat before and just go for one drink and the view",1
Just a great vibe. Recommend!,4
Great view and ambiance! Not so many food options but definitely worth visiting.,4
The service was great as well as the food. The brunch experience was perfect.,4
"Beautiful views. The food was tasty and served quickly. Great music. Very clean. Overall, a great experience and would definitely recommend!",4
Had a blast!! View is spectacular!!,4
Gorgeous location with view. Unfortunately they were out of quite a few beers when we went. This created some confusion when trying to order from the waitress. The food was surprisingly good and the heaters kept us warm in the fall weather. Overall if was a very pleasant experience.,4
"Loved the view, such a treat to sit and chat with friends and enjoy a drink. Highly recommend",4
"The Lookout Rooftop definitely has an amazing view, but for brunch it's just ok. There are not a lot of options and the one's they have are just ok.

If they could improve the food options it would be an amazing brunch spot, not just a bar.",2
the guy who works the hostess stand sucks and is very rude and awful fire him,4
Service was great - even when they got busy.,3
"Beautiful views, good drinks and vibe. Recommend stopping in during the evenings!",4
"We had a nice time at the Lookout Rooftop. Great views! The drinks are definitely expensive tho so be prepare to spend $17 on a cocktail. Cost more than the some of the food. 

We will definitely return.",4
Fun afternoon,4
Wife and I had an amazing time. We were in town for the weekend and the view was incredible. Def recommend lookout bar.,4
"We get there and you don‚Äôt need a reservation. Actually the better view is in the walk in areas. But, we get to the reservation area which always for a server and there were 3. All of them just hanging out laughing, which is fine, but took 10 mins just to ask us for our drink order. There were 4 more tables, so it‚Äôs not that they were busy at all. The drink prices were a bit insane. A bud light was $8. Come on‚Ä¶., the view was fantastic though and bc of the view we were able to see the barking crab and had a much better time there. The food choices at look out was weak. 5 options and none really looked or sounded excellent. So come here for the view and get a few pics in, but you don‚Äôt really need a rsvp.",2
"Great view, but the food could be better.  The cocktails were just ok--have had better in Boston.",3
"The drinks were very disappointing, the star of the show is the view!",3
"Went for drinks, it was my first time visiting Boston! Drinks are a bit pricey but definitely worth it. Our server was absolutely amazing. She was very patient with our questions and her recommendations. Definitely would visit again! Worth a try as the view is absolutely stunning.",4
"Lookout Rooftop is AMAZING!!  I would highly recommend it here to anyone.  We celebrated my daughter's 27th birthday and couple of her friends in Boston were able to join us.

I am planning to come back with a group on Nov 6th & cannot wait!!

Food was great and the cocktails were fantastic!",4
"Just go here if you want to see the view and have a few drinks, food is not good and $$$",2
"Great vibes, great service, trendy music. A+ view!",4
"Get together with friends, beautiful view and delicious cocktails - overall amazing experience!",4
Gorgeous view for lunch!,4
Beautiful views but limited menu and expensive drinks. You pay for the ambiance and view!,2
Excellent spot to enjoy a cocktail and light bites. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Food tasted excellent and serving size was perfect with cocktails.,4
Beautiful views and great drinks. Light dinning food was great too,4
Amazing ! The waitress was so nice with a great personality!!,3
"Then Elevator broke and caused a line even for folks with reservations because the hotel prioritized hotel guests. It was also pretty scary for those trapped in the elevator and those that had to ride the ‚Äúfixed‚Äù elevator after them. That said, The view was awesome and in spite of slow service the staff was very nice.",3
"Another great day on the rooftop 
The entire staff was fantastic 
Josh and his team, especially Harry, go above and beyond 
We will be back!",3
Rained a little but then cleared and views were fantastic. Wait staff very welcoming,3
"Although we had reservations at 6, we didn‚Äôt sit until 6:20. That was ok as service was great! Thank you!",3
Great view but the service could have been better.,2
"Really nice place l, great view and atmosphere. :)",4
Birthday brunch for my friend. The view was amazing. The food was good but nothing special.,3
"Great view, nice staff. Food mediocre and all served on plastic - including knife and forks. I appreciate the restaurant is at a height and its probably for safety reasons, but it really took away from the experience. Would not recommend for anything more than a casual meal. We were hoping for a nice celebration brunch, and it definitely does not feel that way!",2
"A wonderful place to sit outside and take in the view of the harbor and river.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  The drinks and food are rather so-so.  Nothing terrible, the drinks were rather weak and the guacamole fresh but flavorless.  Still, while it may not be superlative food, the atmosphere is worth it.  We had a wonderful time.",3
Rooftop was loud and the bar / bar food was divvy,3
"The view is the only reason to visit this bar. The drinks were absolutely putrid. The service was mediocre. $17 for a vodka drink, $13 for a can of beer. Their version of a Manhattan, for $17 was undrinkable.",1
I would recommend for drinks or appetizers maybe.   Lunch was poor at best and expensive,0
"Gorgeous views, good food, fast and attentive service, and nice drinks. The one down side was the heater nearest us was out of gas so it was pretty chilly. But I'll definitely come back here with friends again!",4
Wonderful experience. Got a couch setup for 6. Great city view. We were celebrating s birthday. The staff brought out cupcakes!,4
View was fantastic! some staffs are awesome some are lazy and so cheap with the napkins jeez!,2
"the shots were too expensive, loved everything else though!",4
Awesome view!,4
The cocktails were over priced which I wouldn‚Äôt mind if they were good. They were poorly made and looked ugly. I would have just gotten a cider. Also the fries were horrible. But the view beautiful,1
"Super staff, fantastic service",3
Honestly not worth the hype. Scene and not great vibes. Food wasn‚Äôt good. Drinks were fine.,0
Perfect view,4
"We made reservation at 10:30 pm and arrived on time. The host downstairs required us to wait in line in first floor for about 30mins ! ! ! even though we told her that we have reservation. When we were finally allowed to go upstairs, the bar was already closed. Very bad experience, terrible and mess management!",0
"The fodd was so/so. Guacamole needed more salt and spices, chips weren‚Äôt crisp enough and fish sandwich needed to be accompanied by more flavorful sides. Fries were good but it‚Äôs rare that fries aren‚Äôt. I would not come back to dine but instead to enjoy a drink and the view.",2
"I enjoyed a delightful lunch!  It was our first time here and we were impressed!  The views were magnificent, food delish, service impeccable and the atmosphere had a cool relaxed vibe.  Thank you we‚Äôll be back!",4
"It's always a good experience ,the view was stunning üòç the atmosphere very friendly",4
"The service was terrible, the view is nice. Not a place to eat",1
"It was really great but everything was served in plastic and it was really windy so the plastic plates and platters were whipping around. For the price, you‚Äôd think they could do China plates.",3
Perfect for a beautiful Saturday brunch. We were celebrating my spouse‚Äôs birthday. They treated us great and we were hanging out for hrs. The booths were very comfortable as well.,4
"Very limited menu, strong drinks and decent views.",3
"I‚Äôm sorry, 45 min for a drink, not organized at all.
I couldn‚Äôt even spend the minimum of 200,00 that they charge us.
Bye",0
"Nice view and vibe, especially for a celebratory event. Good menu is limited but whatever we ordered was delicious.",2
21st bday - weather was gorgeous and the view of the city was spectacular,4
The experience was incredible with beautiful views of the city and great drinks.,4
"Amazing service,  went out if the way to get our drinks and very accommodating to rain.",4
Such a fun experience. Every seat had a nice view of the seaport. The staff was wonderful. Would definitely go again,4
"It was a great atmosphere for our first time there., We would go back.",4
"I anticipated the atmosphere to be a little more sophisticated, but when we walked in it seemed like a college club. Luckily, there was a quieter sitting/dining area away from the bar. The views were cool (even though this rooftop is only on the 7th floor), drinks/food were also good albeit a little pricy, our server was friendly and attentive. Overall, I'm glad we checked it out while on vacation in Boston even if it wasn't 100% what I was expecting.",3
The only good thing about this place is the view anything else is bad .,1
Amazing view,4
The view was incredible! Received excellent service.  A definite must try.,4
"It is about the view, and that is it. Food is not that great. It is not a classy place to visit.",0
Not what I expected! I made reservations for my daughter‚Äôs birthday and got sat on the only table that did not have a Shade!!!!,0
"Beautiful views. Excellent wait staff. The host who sat us looked overwhelmed. Check on him. The food was great. I would add more fish to the ‚Äúlight fare‚Äù menu. Besides the views and company, the hip hop and r&b music was on point. Thank you.",4
Very weak cocktails for the price ‚Äú17$s‚Äù,3
"It‚Äôs all about the view. Drink and food is only fine, nothing exciting.",2
"Best place to have a great night drinks,food is not the best but it‚Äôs okay , bartenders really nice ../",4
"Great view of the city, but don‚Äôt plan on having dinner because menu is very limited.",2
"This being my first time, I have to say it was a great experience !!! I went during the day around 2 o‚Äôclock when it wasn‚Äôt too busy  had a nice high top table we had a great waiter,  the service was  very good !!! we ordered two salads some drinks and it was perfect!!",4
A little pricey but food and views were fantastic!,4
"This place is always fun! The vibes were very lively, lots of people having a good time. It was incredibly loud which isnt my favorite but it made it more exciting you could say! Food was meh - flatbread was pretty sad but pork belly was tasty. Drinks were good but for $17 they better be! I like coming with friends, views are awesome and its fun.",3
"It‚Äôs was truly awesome! I did part of my 10th year anniversary pictures there because the view is incredible! Although me and husband don‚Äôt drink the waiters provided us with some nice virgin drinks. The appetizers were awesome too, although I thought they could be a bit more in size, like the guacamole for example, even if you double the amount and increased the price people would pay for it. Overall it was great and I want to go back.",4
"Lookout Rooftop's shining star is without a doubt the view. Food was ok, nothing special but no complaints. Cocktails were very good but very overpriced.

Would recommend",3
Fast service! Just wish the waitresses wore masks as they go from table to table interacting with lots of people all night.,3
"We loved the awesome food,  beautiful view and service!",4
"The rooftop is a great place for a date night or a Girls night ! The couches can comfortably sit a large group and the views are incredible! There‚Äôs music and a great vibe, and drinks are delicious!",3
"It would be great to add a bit more of options to the food menu like sliders, mini burgers, chicken strips‚Ä¶",4
"Beautiful view (for either day or night), highly suggest making a reservation",4
The food was okay but a little pricey. Water cups smelled like a toilet but I think that was from stacking wet cups. Overall good vibe with a wide range of people.,1
"The server was nice but forgot about our food until we told her. Food is just ok but has a very limited selection for weekday lunch and comes in take-out boxes. Cocktail is ok as well, a bit pricey though. But the view was phenomenal! Picturesque place with mediocre food and cocktails.",3
Absolutely delicious food with a gorgeous view of Boston! Highly recommend!,4
The ambience is nice the waitress and the host- they were all great. The food and the drinks were delicious over-all it was nice but the noise level was pretty high.,4
music a bit too loud to talk with folks sitting next to you,4
"Overcharged for forgotten drinks, but problem was fixed",1
"Definitely worth the reservation & cost! No waiting in line to get in. No waiting for drinks. Mixed drinks were inconsistent but tolerable.  Overall, you cannot beat the private table with this view.",3
Was a little too crowded and the time limits on table reservations were a little much.,3
Excellent venue and atmosphere. Staff were top notch.,4
"A reservation is a must, as it gets very crowded and loud. Service was a little slow, but it was a packed Saturday.",2
"Amazing view, drinks, and food! GREAT location!",4
Made reservations as soon as they opened reservations on 18 days in advance. We get there and they said the only table they had for us was an office table that smelled like bleach. Food and drinks were ok.,1
"Made reservations 2wks ago for 3 in the afternoon.  Got there and the only table they had available was one of the worst.  They have mostly high tops with umbrellas. We got sat at one of the only two regular tables with no umbrella and it was hot.  Drinks were very expensive which was expected, menu is very limited and service was average, nothing great.  View was beautiful though.  We finished up and headed over to The Barking Crab for half of the price and way better Tim‚Äôs.",2
View is absolutely beautiful,3
"The food and cocktails was not as good as it
should have been for $17+ each item",3
"Great spot with views of town.  Definitely a scene.  Very difficult to get in touch with the staff for questions/guidance about the venue for planning purposes.  Hotel doesn't really help, website and outgoing VM messages are conflicting and no one returns phone calls.  Like a lot of spots, you pay for the view.",3
Extremely Loud!!,2
"I made the reservation for the rooftop thinking I was getting the area with sofas. I honestly don‚Äôt recall seeing 2 options for outdoor seating. We were given a table in the area designated for eating more than the limited menu available with the sofas. It was extremely noisy and uncomfortable. I explained the situation to the hostess who was not accommodating at all. She would not allow us to wait for the area with the sofa. We were given 1.5 hours to finish our drink and food. Felt rushed and not at all enjoyable. Wont be back nor will I recommend it.
And the guacamole is not real avocado. Tasteless!",2
It was a bit more happy hour crowd that romantic evening. But I get in now.,3
"We ran 15 min late. I was nervous they wouldn‚Äôt accommodate us. When we arrived, they said our original table wasn‚Äôt available, but to give them a few minutes. They were so nice and friendly. The view was spectacular!",4
"Service was great. Food was okay, wish they had more variety on the fare dining menu, but what they had was tasteful. Drinks were great and delicious.",3
Great spot for a Summer day! Need more options on light fare menu,4
"The Manager on duty last night chose to kick a guest out who according to him was over served! He was way out of line and made a decision based on someone else‚Äôs false claims. This guest is a 45 year old Physician and is by nature outgoing and kind, not drunk and loud according to the young manager. He was Inappropriate and even though we told him we wouldn‚Äôt be drinking he actually said that he didn‚Äôt want her to be stealing drinks off other patrons tables!!  He is obviously on a power trip and he should not be managing a bar that‚Äôs sole purpose is to allow people to enjoy themselves while having a couple drinks with friends.",0
The service was not good.  Waited a long time for drinks.  Drink orders were not brought sometimes.,1
"Amazing, perfect view to the city of Boston,",4
I loved the place very confortable ! The view is amazing .,4
"We went for brunch. The menu was very disappointing. There were only a few options and everything came out in to go containers. We felt very rushed by our server. Great view, but probably will not go again",1
"Awesome view, great service this is our favorite spot!",4
Got my friends together for a farewell party. Great view and employees accommodating with table and the small decor I put up. Food is overpriced and average - but went there for the ambiance.,3
Servers were very attentive! Food was great!,4
"They didn‚Äôt even honor our reservation that we made 3 weeks in advance. We were supposed to have dinner at 7:45 and they made us wait 15 minutes, then it rained for 15 minutes and they told us they didn‚Äôt know when they could seat us. So we left at 9:00. They were supposed to text us when a table was ready for us  and we never even got a text. What‚Äôs the point of making a reservation if they can‚Äôt keep up their end of the bargain.",0
Excellent view,4
"What a great spot. Can't beat the view! Service, food, and ambiance were excellent. Definitely eating here again.",4
Crowded and very noisy if you like that. Limited selection of food served with plastic take out type service materials. Food itself was just ok. Nice view- that‚Äôs the point here.,2
Finally on our third trip to Boston was able to get a reservation.   Cool place but other Seaport places have better - unobstructed - views,3
Beautiful spot to have drinks and take pictures on special occasions!,4
Love the food and the view will deff go again,4
The brunch menu has a lot to be desired.  It seems the main purpose of this location is drinking and it does have a remarkable waterfront view.,2
Fantastic waitstaff and bartenders,4
One the best views of Boston harbor with great drinks and food!,4
We sat at the dining section which was great and had an amazing view! The staff was helpful and kind and the atmosphere was very lively. The drinks and food were good and it was a pleasant evening.,3
"I booked the ‚Äúexperience‚Äù table with a $50 min per person, and when I changed the number of people (I called) the host said that was no problem. So when we arrived at our seats, turned out that we were sat in the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù section the entire time and couldn‚Äôt order dinner/snacks other than guac lol. So we had to leave and go somewhere else. The waitstaff was generally OK and nice but weren‚Äôt attentive at all, just kind of annoyed we were even there. Overall the view is amazing, but every time I come here there‚Äôs a lot left to be desired, everyone acts like this is on the level of NYC rooftops but it‚Äôs not even close. Also pretending that the roof is packed by having people wait in line to generate hype is super lame, like how about actually make it a happening place to begin with and people will start coming in droves.",1
"Very nice rooftop! Food and cocktails are quite pricy, but the views are phenomenal.",4
The view is 10x better than the food. I recommend only going for drinks,2
"I Love coming to Lookout Rooftop. I have been several times during the week, and weekends and every time is beautiful. I have come several years for my birthday to enjoy the drinks and the view. I just wish the menu was more inclusive but usually you can find one thing to munch on. I love it here.",3
"View was beautiful, we enjoyed a lot!",4
The place was a good aesthetic but the drinks were bad and over price. They didn‚Äôt make my friends drink correctly Bc they lacked a mixer and then when asked about it waitress got an attitude‚Ä¶ she should of gave the option to change it before they made drink.,1
Fantastic place! Beautiful views and great cocktails. Definitely get a table because the area by the bar was super crowded and loud but having a table for my group made for the perfect night!,4
my date loved it! the land-side sunset is underrated,4
Birthday was amazing!,4
Service was a bit slow but everyone was very friendly and great atmosphere.,3
No call for a cancelled reservation. Travelled way too far to be turned down at the door with no notice. Bouncer was awful. Didn‚Äôt get to sit or eat and glad I didn‚Äôt.  Reccomend Tuscan restaurant,0
"Very good time with family, but menu is limited.",4
"Great spot, had a fun time. Drinks were amazing and so was the food. Our food was a little cold but was replaced right away. Outstanding service. Will be returning soon.",4
The ambiance and view are great. The food is solidly mediocre. All the dishes are decent but nothing is outstanding.,3
Too expensive for the value you get and lousy food. The only thing is the nice view,1
"It is not worthy 
We were 4 people paid $200 and it was rainy and they couldn‚Äôt accomodate umbrella !!!
This is min you need we you prepaid $50 for each person 
The service was horrible 
I don‚Äôt recommend this place",0
"Great service, beautiful views, and my fros√© was delicious üòã",4
"The view is amazing. 
Sadly the service is not that great. The girls are not in a great mood. 
The lunch food is Ok, nothing special that would make us go back again. 
What they have is the amazing terrace and view.",3
"Great for a day/night out, preferably more drinks than food as food options are limited, but over all, a very nice place",4
"We had lunch on the rooftop.  It was a super hot day but there were umbrellas & a lovely breeze.  The view is beautiful.  The waitstaff was super friendly, helpful & cheerful despite the heat!  There is also covered area with sofas & there is a nice breeze.  They have gluten free bread for the burger & sandwiches for those who are gluten intolerant.  The French fries are the skinny delicious ones!!  We had a delightful lunch!!!",4
"The menu is hard to understand,  we made the reservation for brunch, scanned the code for the menu, placed order to discover no brunch during the week, huh??   The lunch menu was sparse.
The server never asked if I wanted another drink.
There is a time limit on the table, was not aware of this until arrival.
Nice views of the river but I would not go back.",2
"Cocktails aren‚Äôt good. 
There should be more options specially for vegetarian people.",2
"Great scene, service - meh, food - meh, drinks - bad (stick w/ beer or wine!).
We had a reservation for 6 and got a great table in the shade on a hot, windy day. The view was of the piers and buildings so it was so-so, but still nice to be out on a beautiful day. Server was nice but clearly not well trained. They thoughtfully got us a big pitcher of ice water on a hot day. Drinks were distributed randomly to us but we figured it out, but they were SUPER weak, so my 2nd drink was froze - might as well have a slushy if it's going to be weak anyways!
Just ordered a flatbread, garlic guac and a dog bowl of delicious fries. Portions were pretty good and the food was OK, but there were hardly any choices for food. What we ordered were the only shareable options.
There is still a 90 minute limit on your reservation even after the state of emergency has been lifted, but it turned out to be OK b/c we weren't going to continue to waste our $$ on poorly executed, weak drinks.
Go for the scenery and people watching, maybe some food, then don't stay. Go around the corner to Drink for something worth talking about!",2
"We had drinks for my sister‚Äôs bachelorette. Great views of the city, delicious watermelon frose, good music. Was great to be out in Boston again!",4
Very fun place to visit but difficult to sit and eat comfortably because of the very intense wind tunnel up there. Not sure what can be done about that but the ambience is quite lively and fun!,3
Made accommodations for our group. We truly appreciated the hostess of the rooftop during our time there.,4
Was more college party atmosphere than expected.,2
"For such a limited menu, I would have expected each dish to be outstanding. The plates were average at best. It said ‚Äúdinner‚Äù menu, but everything was basically a shareable plate. Then you had to get 1-2 per person because the portions were so small. The items were also outrageously overpriced for the low value of them (definitely not worth the Rooftop view). We ended up going somewhere else afterwards because we were all still hungry. Also, our server constantly looked like he had somewhere else to be and was just stopping by because he ‚Äúhad to.‚Äù The cocktails were good; however, I would not go back again, the experience overall was dissapointing.",2
One of the best views of the city!  Great spot for drinks and apps,4
"The place is only good for a few pictures and to have a look at Boston SKyline for a few minutes that's about it. The food and services are horrible. Our shrimp cocktail was thrown in a disposable plate with a vinegar-y sauce in a plastic cup. The waitress forgot my Mocktail drink that she came back with in 20 mins (when the table if given for 90 mins only), guess my mocktail wasn't that imp amongst the other alcoholic drinks that my friends ordered. The food was cold and served in the banking trays, and we never got the salad that my friend had ordered, and we all stepped out hungry only to go to another restraurant. 
Overall, go there for the ambience and that's all.",1
"Definitely would recommend to have a bigger food menu so that the customers aren‚Äôt very limited with the options. Overall, the view and atmosphere was great.",3
"Personally I found the reservation system very confusing and was disappointed at the fact that we could not eat at the cocktail section. Greeting manager/ host was not friendly at all. We were offered a high top (since we did want to eat), it was Black stone High top under a scorching 90 degree sun with no option for umbrella close by, which I didn‚Äôt mind but I can see this as a dealbreaker for others, or even for myself if I hadn‚Äôt been prepared with a hat and sunscreen. At least some placemats on the black tables would‚Äôve been nice! 
We ordered the guacamole and it was very salty, too much lime and tasted like pre-made supermarket guac. Sandwich was ok, and the haddock battered sandwich smelled off. 
OJ and water had no ice in them.
The view is amazing! Go there have a drink (the froze was good) take a picture and get out! Maybe if staff was friendlier the experience wouldn‚Äôt have been so bad.",0
"Worst experience ever. Will never return,",0
"love the view and workers are very nice 
make sure to reserve",4
Awesome view!!!,4
"Although we had reservations, the side we were seated at did not offer food at all.",1
"Horrible! Not prepared, scorching hot with no shade. Definitely not worth the money.",0
"Great food, service was very poor.  The view is spectacular.",1
"Horrible service. We arrived with a reservation and three of the six of us got a drink within 5 minutes then when the other three asked for drinks it took over 20 minutes and I had to chase down another server. 

Just because the server says ""these drinks will be on me"" does not forgive the fact that we only got in one round of drinks because last call was 8 minutes after the drinks arrived. TERRIBLE",0
"Such a beautiful spot to enjoy views of Boston! I wish the food presentation could be as excellent as the atmosphere. Our coffee was cold. Real dishes and silverware, please!",3
There was a dead spider in my pizza,0
"You pay mostly for the view. The food menu for brunch is average, not too many options and there is no single vegan option. Our waitress was also not nice, and didn‚Äôt want to help us in getting a vegan alternative. We had to ask another waitress and he helped us to get an avocado toast. However, the price was same as the salmon breakfast sandwich, which didn‚Äôt make much sense.  Overall, the view is totally worth it!",1
Please add more vegetarian options to your brunch menu!,4
Nice but needed more staff,3
A perfect place to give our visiting family a view !,4
"Abysmal. If you will be happy with a great view and a drink, have at it. If you also expect to be treated with any sort of respect for your patronage or consideration of your time, also if you want to eat, skip this place. Service from the host to both waitstaff we dealt with was some of the worst we've experienced in this area (lots of fab places to go). We were ignored for 10+ mins, with reservations, at the door- host was wandering around, not quite busy. We were ignored for another 10 mins after being seated, when service did arrive it was not with any care or grace. Waters never refilled, 2 items ordered just never came. It was pretty busy but... have more staff on shift or don't accept the reservation (made with a credit card deposit no less). Just really disappointing. Definitely avoid for anything but social drinking- including getting those drinks yourself from the bar- with a view. This place is not what it's trying to be.",0
"Overall is a great experience but the person in the reservation area was not really welcoming, the server was so great and friendly to us. The menu there is not many options. But as I said overall was a great place to eat.",4
"Menu options were limited and service was a little slow, but the food was very good (I had the salmon toast) and the drinks were great (I had the Patron Abuja Loco).  The views and rooftop ambiance were great.",3
"The Lookout Rooftop has amazing views of the city of Boston.  Great atmosphere, good food and friendly staff.  Would recommend this place to anyone.",4
The hostess was the most rude person I‚Äôve ever met. Drinks are fine. People go for the view,1
View is cool on a nice day but get there for open or it‚Äôs mobbed. Little pricey but would come back,4
"Started raining, great spot tho",4
"View is amazing! Staff were on their game, we never waited for anything.",4
"Great service/ the entire staff was super nice. Great drinks menu, amazing views. Love that you have to have a reservation, keeps the crowds down.",4
"This is a delightful place to kick back and enjoy a drink.  They have a great cocktail list and everything we tried was delicious, and their wine by the glass list was also solid.  Our server was fantastic!  We didn't try the food, but it appeared to pretty much be your typical bar food.  The real star of the show is the lovely view.  A very fun place to start or end the evening!",4
The atmosphere was great.  Service was outstanding.  We got our table right on time and was served right away. I thought the prices were a bit expensive and the portions were very small.,3
amazing view! will definitely come back with friends!,4
"this establishment ruined the surprise we had for our newlywed friends, the server was extremely rude and clearly wasn‚Äôt having a good day but that‚Äôs still no excuse to have an attitude with your guests. I was disappointed in the fact that they weren‚Äôt able to execute my simple request of having a bottle of champagne and custom glasses on the table when we arrived. Not to mention  I had dropped them off 2 hours before our reservation.  I thought that I was making a smart decision by iterating my request to a manager in hopes to ensure a successful surprise but I guess I was wrong. Extremely disappointing and the servers attitude towards us after the fact was the icing on the cake.

Only reason why I would consider going back here is because the view is beautiful. I just won‚Äôt have any special occasions or requests since there seems to be a huge lack of communication and hospitality.",1
The rooftop was nice. Nice views. The waiter however made the experience awful. Super rude and impatient.,2
Had a reservation and still had to wait 15 minutes. Once we sat down no one came over to us. We waited an entire 30+ minutes and still no service. We left without ever getting served,0
View is always great (caught the sunset). Good music. Waiter was friendly. Food was good but way overpriced for the portions.,3
Chinese student visiting,4
Love this place. Music though could be a little less. Almost unable to have a conversation.,4
Absolutely amazing send-off for a friend moving to Florida. The experience was incredible. Could not have asked for a better evening.,4
"Food was very poor.  served on paper plates with plastic 'silverware'.  salad was old.  guacamole did not seem to be fresh.  order the fries - best thing on the menu.  Happily service, while slow, was delightful.",1
The menu was small and the food was decent but the view was spectacular.,2
Birthday dinner!,4
"Food variety not the best, portuons for sharing kind small... amazing view and good drinks",3
We went up late at night 9pm and thought we would miss out the evening sunset view but it was still amazing and relaxing.,4
"Service was awful. Servers were pretty neglectful, took them 30 min to take our food order, but ambiance and views cant be beat. Food was subpar and the menu was super limited. It's basically all apps. You come here for drinks and the vibes, not for a nourishing dinner. Would go back with different expectations and just for the cool vibes.",2
"My waitress was very bad, she bring the drink fast but never come to ask for food, after 25 minutes waiting to order food I ask someone else and he took the order for her also she walked couple times next to us and never ask if we want something to eat, we have to ask someone for more drinks.. honestly server is bad..",1
I gave this place 5 stars for the views only. our waitress was not good at all I'm not sure she had issues with us or what but she had a major attitude. but go for the views and the instagramable pix!,3
"Loved the rooftop, drinks were great and food was the right amount",3
"It was a fun, young hip place that was good more for a drinks  venue then for food. Pretty rooftop space.",3
"We really loved the ambiance! I had the salmon brunch meal. It was good, but it needed more of the toppings for flavor. The breakfast sandwiches were liked by all. Caesar salad was excellent, but chicken was put on warm, which always makes the salad a little less refreshing. They made my son a grilled cheese which he loved. Drinks were stiff and delicious, but expensive. Would like to try another meal here since the brunch menu is a bit more limited in variety. But we will definitely be back.",4
"Loves place, thought there would be a better brunch menu. Still good though. More of a drink place!",3
"I love the views from Lookout Rooftop and was excited to enjoy my first Saturday night out since the state loosened all COVID restrictions however, the service was horrible! I made a reservation for 9pm and arrived closer to 9:15pm due to parking (I did call ahead to let them know). When we arrived our table was not ready and we had to wait 10 minutes to be seated. Once seated, it took about 20 mins for our server to come take our drink order. He disappeared for another 15 minutes before I was able to flag him down with a question about the menu. He quickly answered (yet seemed annoyed) and disappeared again. To clarify he passed our table multiple times but was busy helping other parties. After a while another server came to check on us and we were able to put in our food order. I completely understand it was a busy night but it felt as though we were intentionally being ignored. 

In addition, the dinner menu was very limited which was disappointing. The options seem more like appetizers and are not mindful of dietary restrictions.",1
"Absolutely amazing!!! Already going to make my next reservation! Gorgeous ambiance, food was great. Not a crazy amount of choices on the menu, but still worth going.  

I adore this spot! Definitely check it out!!!",4
My first time I love the place I back soon ‚ù§Ô∏è To my friends again,4
Great time and amazing service. Extremely accommodating,4
"Booking the high tables in the summer is SO worth it for the view! It was pretty windy but the cocktails were great (though a little pricy). The location can't be beat and on a Sunday afternoon, this was a perfect brunch location.",4
"The view is amazing and I love the atmosphere! There are couches with fire fits and tables. The food was just ok but the drinks were great! The service was great, Ashley, was awesome! So much fun!",4
"The location to Lookout Rooftop was beautiful. It overlooked the water and the city skyline was great. 

The food was good but not for the price. The food value versus the quality were not comparable. The drinks were subpar. The drinks were watered down and even their strongest drink was simply bad. 

This is a nice place if you want to look like you are in an upscale restaurant in pictures.",2
nice location but completely overpriced considering the poor offer of food and the drink selection wasn¬¥t the best for a place that expensive.,0
Very noticeable that all minorities were placed in the back regardless of open tables being available closer  - I‚Äôve been here many times and never got that type of feeling,0
"Our waitress Samantha was quite pushy with making us order more drinks, kind of off-putting. Otherwise, drinks were pretty good. Nice ambiance. Fun time on the rooftop.",3
"Special day, very nice place for my birthday. Go back soon",4
"Ambiance is really good; however, serving food with plastic utensils is extremely disappointing! It is not fast food chain after all!
The quality of food as well as a choice are very average not to say more.
Such a beautiful location and ambiance deserve much better!",2
Please tell large parties to keep away from the pit more they were loud and hanging around rope off the area better so they stay in their section,3
"It's funny that we were in this open rooftop setting and were able to easily hear everyone at our table. We were not privy to conversation at any table near us, though.  Quite ideal in this regard!  The view is magnificent, the atmosphere is inviting with warm wood tones and greenery.  The weather was perfect when we went, but there are heating pyramids in case it is cool when you visit.  Lookout Rooftop's staff were attentive and knowledgeable in addition to very nice.  The food and drinks were delicious.",4
We had a great brunch with a fine view!   service was excellent,4
Love this place!,4
"The food quantity was very small for the price paid.  More food choices like nachos, fries, pizza would be good addition.",3
Great ambiance - will definitely be back! Perfect place to relax after work or out with friends.,4
"The view was spectacular. Service was great. Just wish there were a bit more app choices. Otherwise, highly recommend",4
"My wife and I dine out frequently with our Daughter (1 year old) and do not expect restaurant staff to jump through hoops to accomodate us, but we do expect to receive at minimum average service.  That was not our experience yesterday, from the start the hostess seemed annoyed that we brought our own seat for the baby, the waitress took our drink order almost as she was walking by vs. stopping at the table and greeting us.  From that point forward we maybe saw her for a total of 30 seconds.  I'm not sure if the restaurant was understaffed but we saw other guests visibly annoyed by the poor service around us. The appetizers and drinks were the only bright spot.  The entrees (burger and chorizo pizza) were AWFUL.  The waitress did not come to check on what we thought of the food.  Since we began dining out again (post pandemic) we go out of our way to tip 30-40% understanding that restaurants and workers have been hit hard during the last year.  We begrudgingly tipped 10% last night because our experience was POOR.  Considering the location and clientele you would expect much better, unfortunately we were left with bad taste in our mouth, both figuratively & literally.",0
"LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION.  It has the best rooftop in Boston bar none with the best views.  Noise levels are kept to a minimum by the spacing, size and outdoors.  We had the premium table in the corner with a firepit, and you can't beat that on a chilly overcast Memorial Day after the rain has let up.  What could be improved is THE FOOD, which is fair at best. No surprises, and nothing I would long to come back for foodwise, and the aesthetics of it was mediocre as well, especially the Mezze plate, which is more salad than Mezze to share, as it should be.  The service was good, but nothing to write home about either.  The drinks were very good, but everything outdoors is horribly served on very cheap plastic, even the cutlery. EVERYTHING.  There is no real reason for this. It is environmentally unconscionable in this day and age, and cheapens the beautiful views and ambience of a perfect location.  Hopefully they'll get a clue and change this to be a little nicer.",4
Our rooftop server (male) was awesome. I forget his name but he was great.,3
"Todo excelente, los meseros, incre√≠bles! Recomendado!",4
The veiw is soooo amazing and the drinks are good! I always have a great time here. My server Kayla was so nice!! I will always come back here!,4
The view was great! The service was wonderful. The weather changed on us so it ended up being cold and raining. This is definitely a place I would rather go to on a nice day because besides the view there‚Äôs really nothing else impressive about the restaurant. Drinks were over priced and food was blah.,2
We went to celebrate our anniversary and the place was just perfect with views. Was very hard to get a reservation but just lucked out. Drinks are pricey but all worth about the views . We could get vegetarian food which was surprisingly good. Our sever was Kayla and was amazing and had great recommendations! Great place to celebrate special occasions,4
Great service by the staff!,4
Amazing views on a clear day. Rachel was an awesome server and willing to take our picture to document a fun day!,3
The waiter came to the table and got our drink order but then forgot about our drinks and didn‚Äôt put them in until an hour had gone by. She then never came back to ask us for our food order and by the time she did our reservation was up. We were celebrating a birthday and this service ruined our experience.,0
They need a better selection of food. The scenery was awesome!,0
"Great atmosphere, service was great as well, view is fantastic. Would recommend great location!",4
Very limited menu. Food quality fine. Understaffed.,2
"I absolutely loved the views and the atmosphere at this bar! It was upsetting to see they only used disposable plates, dishes, silverware and cups. I found it very wasteful and it is just unpleasant to see businesses who don't care about the environment. It was a very windy evening and plates, cups and napkins kept blowing off tables and around which means they were polluting and things could have ended up in the harbor which is just awful. I LOVE rooftop bars in general and would 100% recommend this one if they had better sustainability practices. Also, for the price, you would think they would serve things in a nicer way with real dishes.. It was kind of strange to be at a fancy bar but eating off of disposable plates with plastic forks.",2
"Go for a picture at sunset. Get drinks somewhere else. Watered down, expensive, and horrible service.",1
"Food was pretty bad. Guacomole tasted like from a can and chips from a bag, salad was little slimy/overdressed, all I could eat was the chicken off the top which was dry/overcooked.  Waitress nice, but slow service, ordered a second cocktail, came 20 minutes later when I was ready to leave.",1
"Come for the ambiance. Come for the setting. Come for the energy. Come for the drinks. 

Don't come for the service. Don't come for the food.",2
Food wasn‚Äôt good and the drinks were just ok. The views are awesome though.,2
"I was very unimpressed with the experience. Coming from out of town, we prepared and made reservations  ahead of time for a 90 min table so we expected better service. Our waitress hardly ever checked in on us and our drink orders were incorrect. There was a concern about the wind and to hold our belongings, but when we got our food and drinks, everything was plastic, utensils, plates and cups. For a rooftop, you expect more. Our flatbread came in a to-go box. Food and drinks were not great.",1
"Prices have gone way up, I‚Äôm sure because of covid, but unfortunately, service was majorly lacking. Always a beautiful view, though.",4
"All hype, no substance. I booked an ‚Äúexperience‚Äù through Open Table thinking it would be something more special than a regular table, but it was just a table. Whatever, either way I would have been more satisfied with the experience had the service been better. The waiters were very slow (we waited almost an hour before ordering drinks) and one of them was very condescending up until it was time for us to pay. We are paying $17+ per drink, the silverware is still plastic and I am sick of the cardboard boxes where the appetizers/entrees are served. It‚Äôs a mess anyways because they are blown away by the wind easily. I love the ambiance and the view, but I won‚Äôt be returning for a while because it‚Äôs not worth it.",0
"The view is nice, but the food wasn‚Äôt very good & the menu was very small (went for brunch). Music is outdated and loud and service is hard bc it was packed. Good place for drinks - skip the food.",1
Waitress with short black hair was not nice. the view was nice but the experience felt rushed and like she did not want to serve us.,2
"Don‚Äôt recommend it! They brought everything in a very cheap disposable containers not even plates! 
There was no coffee or soft drink menu since they didn‚Äôt have espresso machine! 
The customer service was awful!
Waste of money and time!",0
"Food is just ok.  There are no appreciates or entrees or deserts.  There are small plates of food that resemble appetizers. They use plastic knives, forks and spoons, plastic plates.  Paper boxes to serve the food that are usually used for doggie bags.  The ambience on the roof of the Envoy Hotel is outstanding on a beautiful warm evening.  The liquor and drinks were all top shelf.  Don‚Äôt go there to eat.  But drink and enjoy the company of the beautiful millennials, and the view.   If it were not for the those things, the LookOut would go out of business quickly.",3
"Service was poor.. took a while before table was ready even with reservations. Our server took a while before introducing herself then drinks took even longer! Food was average, drinks were ok. All you really pay for is the view!",1
Beautiful views with good music and very nice staff!,4
I loved everything about this place! Friendly and attentive staff. We had a delicious brunch and they had a wide variety of cocktails to enjoy with great views!!,4
"Super setting, superior service, Steve is the best bartender in Boston !",3
"Great views, food was standard at best. Clam
Chowder was not creamy and had very little, chopped, clams. Drinks were subpar for the price paid - were more like drinks served at a nightclub with sweeteners and syrups rather than fresh fruits, for $17/each.",2
"Very nice spot with a great view. The view is priced into food/drink price, but it's worth doing for a nice occasion or a couple drinks.",4
The envoy lookout is always a successful night out! You really can‚Äôt go wrong whether you‚Äôre just going for a drink to enjoy the view or you‚Äôre sitting down for a nice meal. It‚Äôs always a fun and packed environment but you would never be able to tell from the service as they are quick and usually pretty preemptive on what you need next. The view is out of this world and easily one of the best views in the city!,4
Food menu could have been more extensive. Should add more options but overall good views,3
Great place with an amazing view. The ambiance was extremely nice. The drinks were good and the food was also good.,3
"When we got there with a reservation, the host told us that the hotel guests get priority seating and since its ‚Äúdinner time‚Äù we might have to wait. That was confusing bc whats the point of making a reservation if a hotel guest can just take the table anyway. Once we sat we were at an awkward table behind the host stand. It took a very long time for our waitress to tend to us. We were there for about an hour and saw our waitress 2 times throughout that time and we didn‚Äôt even get the chance to order our dinner. So after one appetizer we left, extremely disappointed.
It was my anniversary and we left and went home and got takeout instead. For a place that makes you put down a credit card number in order to book a table I would expect much more. Also note that i work in the food service industry myself therefor i always emphasize with severs and restaurant staff but this was an absolute awful experience from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. 
Definitely not worth the hype.",0
Beautiful views but food and drinks were overpriced and not great quality,2
"The ambience and location is good, but the drinks and food are not up to the mark or worth their value.",2
Everything was great but the service was very slow... maybe they were understaffed.,4
"Come here for the outstanding view! Limited lunch menu. Food was fine, drinks were great!",3
"The description of this place is totally deceiving. They make it appear to be an upscale dining experience but all it has to offer is terrible, loud music and plenty of drunk college kids. Save your money and go literally anywhere else.",0
"Food was good but it's like a tapas style, small portions for cost",4
"Very hip. Place to people watch and be seen. Great view of Boston Harbor and downtown.
Food is not the emphasis here as it's basically appetizers which are tasty but don't expect a full entree.",3
"Our server was extremely rude and unfriendly. We did order alcohol so he was not catering to us as much as the tables that did. Never checked on us, never asked if we needed more drinks. Overall poor experience for my birthday",0
Not much choice to eat and very poor service (served cold food) and had to return and few items ordered but never served so ended up cancelling the order. Drinks were watered down with more ice then the drink itself.,2
This place is hyped and the food is average. Only attractive part is the view.,1
View is spectacular,3
Great experience beautiful view of the city of Boston OK,4
Excellent service an location.  A few more menu options would have made it top notch.,3
Beautiful view and smoked salmon toast was outstanding. Drinks we very good as well.,4
"Our reservation was for 2 but their system said for 5 which was the reason why they sat us down on a table for 6. We end up asking our waitress if we could move to a smaller table which we did and it had the best view. So looking pass the snarky comments from the hostess for that system confusion, the place and the ambiance were great. Not sure what was better, the food or the view. Please try the French Toasts, 10/10 would recommend.",3
Nice for a Sunday brunch w family and friends,4
"My party and I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance for 10 PM. When we arrived at 9:50, we were told to wait until the lobby until our table for called. I had booked my reservation with another party of 6, and they were called to their table around 10:10. My party waited for 45 minutes to be seated. I even had to ask the hostess outside if the wait time cut into our 90 minute limit. Once we were upstairs, there was no one to attend the host table and we had to wait an additional 5 minutes to be seated. When we got to the table, we had to wait 10 minutes for the server to come and get take our order. The drinks came fairly quickly, but a majority of my party was displeased with the flavors of the drinks. 

I have been to Lookout before, and have had fine experiences, which is why I recommended this rooftop over others to my party this night. I am disappointed to have such a bad experience this time around.",0
"The views were the only thing good about our time at Lookout Rooftop. Our reservation was at 7:45pm and we waited 30 minutes to be seated...almost made it silly to make a reservation. Afterwards, we were seated at a very nice table with a beautiful view, but our table was on a tile that was broken and wobbly. Every time anyone passed, the whole table would shake, and our drinks would spill. Additionally, it took 20 minutes for our waitress to get to us to order food and another 40 minutes for our food to even arrive. With a table at 7:45 and getting served food at 9:15, this was so absurd to us. We also asked for the heat to be turned on, but had to ask two more times because no one was helping us. Additionally, the food was served in ""to-go"" boxes, which surprised us since this was supposed to be such a nice restaurant. For the price of the meal, the taste of the food was fair, and we could have gotten the same food somewhere else far less expensive. The portions were also extremely small. In addition to this, other guests would come up right behind our table, to the point where they were bumping into us, and just remained there to talk and take pictures. This was not COVID safe whatsoever, Unless there are some upgrades, or an incredible sunset, I do not think I will be coming back soon.",1
Great ambiance. Perfect spot for a get together with good friends on a beautiful night. Definitely a great place for special occasions as well. You simply can‚Äôt beat the view!,4
"The menu options were extremely limited! The food we had  was good, just wasn‚Äôt enough options. Also a bit pricey for what you got. Not a fan of the to go boxes everything was served in. At that price point I expected actual plates for the food to be served on. We had a great time and the atmosphere was amazing.... which is what we pay for.",3
Menu was a little limited but other than that everything was good.,3
"The views are great, can‚Äôt beat them on a nice day in Boston. Only complaints would be how loud the music was",4
"The view was beautiful, but the music was way too loud. The waitstaff was under staffed, so unfortunately there was pretty poor service.",3
"Great time, friendly wait staff (Harry was our boy) but cocktails are over priced, aka you pay for the experience of the rooftop with the cocktails",4
Drinks were not that good. Margaritas are terrible. Place has great views (of course) but they're drinks are either way to strong or taste bad.,2
"Overrated 
Line to seat reservations, so we were seated 30 minutes late-we had dinner reservation after at another location so this delay made us rush our time spent there. View is beautiful and server was nice but overall does not live up to the hype!",1
Just very unorganized. But our server was excellent,2
"Amazing views of the city. Terrible service. We saw our actual swerved once. We‚Äôre served by three other people during our visit. Menu was limited. Would go for drinks only, and the atmosphere.",3
"The rooftop view is as expected, but the food wasn‚Äôt anything special and definitely too expensive for the quality.",2
"Fantastic service, if you plan on going to boston on vacation definitely bet on going to this place, its spectacular!!!",4
One of my best experiences while visiting Boston. Would recommend to everyone!,4
"not a spot for a legitimate dinner , limited menu and assumed a place so nice would have actual plates / glasses / cutlery but it was all plastic 

Amazing for quick drinks and to take in the view tho , friendly and upbeat staff , great atmosphere",2
Great place to meet up with peeps who have never been to Boston to appreciate the views. But also a great local for drinks outside.,3
Manager Dave was excellent.  A true professional.,4
"Beautiful view.  Friendly staff.  Menu was limited, but food was very good.  Could have sat there all day in the sun!",4
Loved it but it was chilly,4
"Not a good place for a full dinner, just a couple drinks. view is great but cocktail prices are outrageous for the size and strength of the drink. Nice to do once for a couple of beers but won‚Äôt go back",2
"The service, atmosphere, and view were wonderful. The food was overpriced for the quality and quantity received.",3
Great food. Amazing friendly service.. gorgeous views.,4
"This rooftop was okay. There are not many menu options, mostly drinks. I do not recommend coming here on an empty stomach.",4
"Perfect spot for an outdoor casual dinner. The menu has good quality items -we loved the plaintains, tuna tartare, and flatbread! Excellent view of the waterfront can't be beat!",3
Mother‚Äôs Day,4
"We went here for Mother‚Äôs Day. The service really was very bad, no greeting, long weights, and the food was served in takeout boxes.",0
"I think this is the rooftop with the best view in Seaport! The food is just okay, pretty standard. But it‚Äôs so beautiful that it makes it worth going. I would love to go back just for drinks and appetizers in the evening.",3
"Great time celebrating Mother‚Äôs Day! Service and food were great! The tostones and guacamole is a must try! Amazing views of downtown Boston and great ambience as always. Only thing that could have been better would have been receiving real plates & cutlery. Food was basically served in cardboard boxes and plastic plates/cutlery were flying away in the wind, made it really tricky with kids. But we assumed it was due to covid restrictions/guidelines etc. We‚Äôll definitely return soon!",4
Gorgeous views.  Great drinks.   Would definitely return,4
"What a wonderful view! If you‚Äôre lucky to have good weather as we did, you will get the full Lookout envoy experience. Brunch was a good deal, service was prompt, and the food tasted great. 

Note that the food was served in brown takeout containers with plastic flatware and the mimosas in low glasses rather than flutes; this might have been a wind precaution.",4
I liked the view but the food could have been better. With the wind it was difficult to eat from boxes that kept trying to blow away. regular plates and silver ware would have been better esp for brunch,3
The one waiter was hustling to make sure everyone was served. Awesome spot,4
"We went on a very windy night which obviously cannot be controlled, but we had to hold on to our food which was in a paper box in order to prevent in from flying away, as well as our drinks. Our server checked on us one time for the entire 1.5 hours we were there, and never asked if we wanted to get more food or refresh our drinks (we sat with empty glasses for an hour). I had to actually go up to the bar to ask to pay which is insane, it was not that busy and I kept seeing other tables who arrived after us get served several more times. Even after trying to pay at the bar so that we could leave and go somewhere else that had better service, it still look at least 10 more minutes to get the check. Honestly shouldn‚Äôt have even had to pay for the ridiculous service we received.",0
Amazing staff and management!,4
"Great skyline views but not worth the price. We were a party of 5 and only were able to order one app and two rounds of drinks for the whole time we were there because our server kept walking right past us and prioritizing other tables. Very cold despite advertising heated ""experience"" seating. Not worth the money in my opinion.",2
We had a wonderful time & Michael was so good to us! We‚Äôll be back!,4
Trendy place to be seen. Warm outdoor tables with views of Boston. Good service and food.,4
"The view was absolutely spectacular but the menu prices were pretty steep and service was lacking ‚Äî despite seeing many workers around, had to flag people down twice to get checked on and place additional orders. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth the price due to the ambiance and view, but would have liked to see better quality when it comes to food, drink, and service.",2
Wonderful view from Boston at sunset! Friendly waiters!,4
Not bad. Not great.  Would go back and would recommend.,3
"The service was terrible. There were not enough waiters therefore, we had to wait a long time in between drinks and food. They asked us to leave because of the 90 min grace period, yet our food orders were incomplete. Also, I was running late and the only option I was given to alert the restaurant was to contact the managers via e-mail, which is extremely inconvenient. I would have sent the e-mail if they were listed on the website but the automatic message spelled them out. I was on public transportation and had no way of being able to get any of the manager‚Äôs emails. The food was brought on small cardboard boxes and plastic cutlery.",1
"The only great thing about the outlook is the view. Drinks were OK and the food... never got it, our server forgot to ring it in.",1
Terrible service and food. It was very difficult to order.,0
Great view. Food was great but it is a limited menu. Very comfortable. Drinks were expensive but all worth it because of the beautiful view!,4
Overall great experience.... food can be a bit better for the price that they listed. It‚Äôs a tad overpriced.,4
Fun spot for a great cocktail and a high end snack (could be a light supper). The view is great! The staff are friendly and attentive without being imposing. Will definitely go again.,4
90 min table limit is not a good idea. You tend to keep an eye on the timer which disturbs your peaceful time.,2
Not what I expected!.,2
Amazing place with amazing view! It is a must to go place if you are visiting boston and even if you are living there!,4
I went to this place with my friends and we were super excited to visit and enjoy the time there. The place is stunning that‚Äôs for sure but I did not receive a good service. The waitress was very rude and she even talk to one of my friends with attitude. I know sometimes people might be having difficult moments or are going through things but we were there to enjoy our time and she made it awful. Drinks were good.,2
The view is great! The food is mediocre- but come for a cocktail with a view. Very young crowd at night- quite a ‚Äúscene‚Äù,2
"Waited 25mn to be seated with a reservation for high table. Prople were crowde near the elevators. Ended up on a blue stained thing of poor quality.  90 mn maximum stay.Everything Was cheap. Plastic cups, the waiter wet my foot with my mocktail. Oh sorry he said.  Paper box with 5 shrimps. What a treat. It was for my husband birthday. So disappointed.",0
"Good place, and good people, all was very good, thanks",4
"Very nice location and great staff. It‚Äôs a pity there is poor selection of food and drinks are served in plastic glasses.
Overall we spend an amazing night and definitely a good experience, but could be improved.",3
"I‚Äôve been to numerous restaurants in and around Boston for years. Let me tell you this place has been one of the WORST experiences I‚Äôve had thus far. Myself a few friends enter the restaurant from the elevator and we go up to the host stand to check in. I begin to let the host know I had a reservation, and then while I‚Äôm speaking turns the host turns to his co worker to have a separate conversation unrelated to the restaurant. Then we stand there waiting for the host to re-acknowledge us. Finally after we‚Äôre acknowledged we sit down. Service was slow and the drinks and food were absolutely disgusting. $17 for a small cocktail placed in a plastic cup. Took 30 minutes out of the 90 total minutes just to order and receive a cocktail, that doesn‚Äôt even include us trying to order food. The only positive was the view, and even then it wasn‚Äôt worth it. I don‚Äôt plan on going back, and would not recommend it to ANYONE.",0
"it was a great view, but very windy by the water. food isnt great and slim selection and comes out in togo boxes...  but the drinks are very good and workers were nice and fast",4
"I loved the location and view of the outdoor rooftop. However, the single use plastic plates and silverware were slightly disappointing given they would blow away when there was even a slight breeze. The takeaway containers being used in lieu of plates also seemed wasteful and annoying to eat out of or share in the case of appetizers. I wished they had used reusable forms of dishware and cloth napkins that would not have blown away as easily. The service was good, not great, but the value of the food for the view and location was amazing.",2
Love the drinks and atmosphere here but it was frustrating that we had a set reservation and still had to wait 20-30 minutes to be seated and then only had an hour at the table since we were seated so late. My advise would be to get an earlier time so you can enjoy your entire reservation time.,3
Absolutely beautiful. Food and drinks were so good. Service was friendly and accommodating,4
beatiful view! but the food was very poor with poor menu choices! they definitely need to change the menu with better food options,2
"The view was the only good part really. The weather was cold and windy and it was almost impossible to contact a human to change reservations. The line was busy for a day/voicemail box full, then we got an almost uninterpretable message to leave an email. For the price of the food it was disappointing to have it served in tiny portions in cardboard boxes. Mixed drinks were watered down in plastic cups. Not the experience I was looking for!",2
Muy rico todo y muy buen servicio,4
"Great bar with a nice view of the river and the city. Service didn‚Äôt come back to take our orders too often but they were nice when they did! Definitely on the pricier ends, but the drinks were strong, and worth it.",4
"Ambiance was nice, drinks were over priced and tasted nonalcoholic. Food was good but also overpriced.",2
"We had an amazing time at Lookout Rooftop! The drinks and food were amazing. The atmosphere and view is incredible, and we had great service. Can't wait to come back!",4
"I‚Äôve been here so many times it‚Äôs embarrassing but never in the enclosed upper deck in the cold. The staff was great as always. The food ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs legit TOP notch (way better than I remember), just very expensive for what you get. 

The only odd thing is they don‚Äôt serve on silverware but all plastic. I get that for a roof, but when it‚Äôs all enclosed like those days they should use proper plates etc. 

Other than that - a fantastic place to take in the city.",4
Cumplea√±os 19 de nuestra hija la atenci√≥n excelente de Stephany la joven que nos atendi√≥ en la mesa fue incre√≠blemente amable y atenta üå∑,4
"Everything was great, but the food was not worth what we paid at all.",3
Birthday Brunch,4
Only have heating for reserve seating on a rooftop bar LOL? What do other people do? Just die?,1
"Great place to go for a drink with friends, and the view is amazing!",4
"Great brunch spot, the salmon toast was amazing and the views of Boston were incredible.",4
"It took 20 minutes before a server even came over to us, another 10 before the drinks came... it wasn‚Äôt horribly busy either. The drinks were outrageously priced for such a tiny amount (mini plastic cups) and honestly not that good. The place smelled like sulfur, it was nauseating. This was our anniversary and was supposed to be a special way to end our night and it was the biggest let down. The only positive was the service we received from the host who sat us, he was wonderful. I was super unimpressed and won‚Äôt be returning. We should have just stayed at Mastro‚Äôs where we had dinner to cap the night.",0
Great view and excellent staff.  Menu is rather limited due to Covid but we will check it out again once we are more back to normal,3
Beautiful view but very expensive for what they give you to eat,1
We were in from Philly and it was a quick lunch experience in a great part of town to explore,3
The restaurant was very accommodating. Food was super limited and nothing exciting on the menu.,3
"The views is the best and most remarkable of this place. Pricey food if you looks at it's size and reduced service (COVID19). They are nice and it's a relaxing place.

Won't go back for the food, but for drinks and the view",2
Nice rooftop option in Boston in a great location.,3
This place has pretty good food and drinks are decent but way overpriced. The acoustics of the rooftop are terrible. People‚Äôs voices are too loud in there.,1
Excellent staff,3
"Great vibe and food was excellent, the service was great also.",4
"Pretty good place, nice food and affordable prices. I would visit it again without a doubt.",3
"I understand we‚Äôre in a covid world but every other restaurant is serving with plates and glass. For the price, I‚Äôd expect the food and drink not come in cardboard and plastic.",4
Staff was friendly and service was timely. Great atmosphere and beautiful view!,4
Food was ok but great view and yummy drinks. For such a fancy place I was surprised to see only 9 options in the menu for dinner,4
"We received good service and were even seated immediately despite mixing up the time of our reservation and arriving 45 min early. The quality of food was fine, but we definitely expected more. We were also surprised that everything was served in take out containers and plastic glasses. Not sure why, given that a dishwasher should remove any trace of the virus from the plates/glassware. The place looks like a great spot to have a drink outdoors with your friends, definitely not a fancy brunch destination.",2
All good. Food was great small but great! Service was good!,4
"Lunch menu looked good, but with only overpriced apps for dinner we were left hungry. You could tell the waitress was annoyed with us as we were not drinking alcohol. The view was gorgeous",2
"Went for a birthday party, it was the most beautiful day out so it was very fun. Good place to take pictures, kinda mingle with others. The french fries were the best we‚Äôve ever had in Boston. Cocktails were delicious. Wish the menu was more vegan friendly but if you‚Äôre going just for drinks, not too bad and very fun!",3
It just wasn‚Äôt what I expected for the money. The music was so loud I could barely hear my bf and felt like I was shouting so he could hear me. The food was served in cardboard boxes with plastic silverware. We were seated directly under a spotlight. None of the outdoor space was being used and I‚Äôm not sure why. I was excited to have dinner there and left feeling disappointed.,1
"The Lookout Rooftop bar was exactly how you picture it; a beautiful rooftop bar on the top of a hotel. Unfortunately that's all it was really good for. The food menu was tiny and extremely overpriced for super subpar food (I'm talking $13 Caesar salad and $9 extra just to add chicken!!). The drinks were okay but also very overpriced ($16 is a standard price for a drink in Boston/the Seaport but it came in a plastic cup and was something that I could make myself at home). Overall, it's. a nice place to go if you have friends visiting but don't go if you want to get your moneys worth. There's plenty of other nice places in Boston for a better value.",2
The view it is wonderful and the service it is great! I‚Äôm disappointed about the drinks and food. They didn‚Äôt have some drinks on the menu also it was served in a plastic cup and the food it was served in a paper box also it was not what I expected about flavor. The sofa outside wasn‚Äôt comfortable too.,2
"Views were beautiful and the heaters were some of the best I've ever felt, but for the price I did not expect the food to come in takeout boxes with plastic forks. I was hesitant to give the food 2 stars because it was actually quite good, but so much of the enjoyment of going to a fancy restaurant comes with the presentation and this was not it. My $15 cocktail, though delicious, came in a plastic cup filled the whole way with ice.",2
"The food taste was great, quantity and presentation was underwhelming.",3
"horrible service - we only saw our server once and they only brought us 1 out of the 2 items we ordered, which was mediocre at best",1
Service was great and food was delicious. Wonderful view.,4
Gtreat view and ambience. We were served in boxes which is unacceptable for the type of restaurant. Do not use Covid as an excuse. Other restaurants in Boston serve in regular dinneware. Food was very average. Service was good.,2
"Don‚Äôt eat here. $16 drinks are served in plastic cups. Your food comes in a brown cardboard box and a bag of chips comes inside. 
The server was wearing a rain jacket, odd and unprofessional, especially when you are trying to sell yourself as a trendy and upscale roof top. 

Don‚Äôt get trapped with these glorified happy meals. 

They said that the reason they can‚Äôt give real plates and forks is because of covid. The real reason is because this hotel cannot figure out a way to sanitize their dishes. 

Very disappointing.",0
"Being one of the few rooftops that Boston has to offer, Lookout is worth the visit. The ambience, vibes, and views were great! The service was mediocre. Overpriced drinks served in plastic cups. Come for the views and pics for your IG. Want a better bang for your buck? save yourself the trip.",1
"Location is great. Hospitality iz zero. 
So disapointing.",1
"Very nice view with a friendly staff. The food was great but due to COVID, everything was served on take-out cardboard boxes and cups.  The music was very loud, but it's part of their ambiance. There are tables all throughout the perimeter of the deck outside, and other tables inside. I really like this place.",3
"Great space and amazing views! Just kinda messed up with Covid making them serve the food out of paper boxes. I also thought the menu was strange with very random items, to me no rhyme or reason???  Great spot for a drink for sure!!!",1
"FOOD SAFETY VIOLATIONS. Last Saturday I went here with my friends and ordered a champagne. Waiter took the bucket of champagne and she emptied that into water dispenser later. So definitely do not drink the water here. On the booking website the price of Moet & Chandon champagne is $125 and they charge you $140. Wrong price bad marketing. I asked specifically on my email that I need the champagne after the first round of drinks since it was a birthday  surprise for my girlfriend, and they just place it on our table before our arrival. They just want your money but not interested in providing services. If you are interested in Boston Skyline view than yes 5 out 5 star for that. But not for the services and management.",0
"Went to Rooftop for lunch with out of town company. It was a brilliantly sunny day so the view of the city skyline and the harbor was pristine. 
To my surprise the food was better than I expected, it would help to have a few more choices. 
We sat outside on the rooftop with the sun beating on us it felt warm even though it was barely  60 degrees out. 
Our staff was very attentive .
Overall give it an A-!",4
"Food was good, but not worth the regular cost. Drinks were delicious but again, generally over-priced. Went for the Dine Out Boston discount which was the only reason I went. Views were nice and ambience overall was okay. Wouldn't say I would pick this spot for a special occasion but nice to try once!",2
Amazing view!!,4
Great view and nice setting. Super service and nice staff! Drinks were delicious!,4
It was hard to get a table at first and after that food and service were not good enough for an upscale place like this,0
"Perfect weather and view. The cocktails were delicious.
Overall, a fun afternoon!!",4
"Great view of Boston‚Äôs skyline. Food, not fancy but also very good.",4
Our waitress seemed rushed and unenthusiastic. food options were minimal.,2
"It is worth to go there for the location, the view is stunning. But, food is awful. The burger was served in a paper box and accompanied with a side of chips in a bag. Drinks are pretty expensive but they're nothing special. I would recommend to go it at least once, since the location is beautiful. But for food and drinks it is nothing special.",2
The view was pretty cool. Service was good but food and drinks were alright.,3
Amazing customer service! Very kind waitress and manager. Beautiful view and bar. 100% recommend. Can't wait to come back!,4
The food and drinks were not worth it the only reason to go is for the view.,1
"My friend and I visited Boston (from Chicago) for the first time, and this was the first place we went to. We were completely sober when we got there. We each had two drinks, and we got an appetizer. Our server was really nice and the manager (I believe) was super friendly and even gave us a list of recs for Boston bars/restaurants/sights. Everything was really nice and the views were great. It started to get chilly, so we asked to sit inside and they willingly accommodated. With a half hour left of our hour and 15 minute reservation,  the server then came to our table and asked if we were ready for the check. We decided we‚Äôd have one more drink, and then close out. So we asked for another round (this would be drink number 3), and this person said ‚Äúactually, I think I‚Äôm just gonna bring the check...‚Äù Essentially cutting us off? It was the strangest thing ever because we barely caught a buzz AT BEST. The drinks were 90% sugar water, 10% alcohol. Felt really offended and embarrassed by what happened. I‚Äôll be the first to admit if I‚Äôve ever been over served, and I can say with 110% confidence that I was actually sober enough to fly a f*cking commercial airplane blindfolded. This was super weird and the first time I‚Äôve ever experienced something like this in my life (and I live in CHICAGO). This was just really weird and uncomfortable to say the least. Sucks because we were willing to spend a lot more money and tip much more generously, as the food was good and so was the service and ambiance.",0
"Great view but... Place is overrated! Awful food, extremely expensive. 
6 tostones and a little big of extra salty guacamole for $14. A big joke.",2
"2021 BOS Restaurant Week: 2nd Stop

We choose Lookout Rooftop as our secret brunch/Lunch with a view. This place is very beautiful. You can see the ocean and city view inside and outside the restaurant, also it‚Äôs very close to the courthouse.

Restaurant week menu is very good. An appetizer and a main entree. We love the claim chowder, it‚Äôs very delicious. The burger is very good too. However, the drink is a meh. We enjoyed our time there. It‚Äôs definitely a must go place.",3
Great music and the atmosphere was amazing. I did want to be in one of the bubbles so my son could get a true rooftop experience but of course he doesn‚Äôt drink. Being able to walk outside was great though with the heat going made it cool to experience.,4
Love this place in the summer. Great views. Good drinks. However the service has been lacking. Waitresses and waiters are a little rude. Take their time checking in your table or even seating you. Brunch menu is lacking. It‚Äôs gone down hill since it first opened.,2
Best way to see the city of Boston! Enjoyed drinks and apps with a spectacular view.. definitely an unforgettable experience! Danielle was our server - she was awesome. Would return in the future when visiting the city.,4
Great view and appetizers!!  Will go again,4
"Celebration. Wish the rooftop experience can feel special beyond the view. The service wear detracts from the experience & taste especially when you‚Äôre drinking Veuve Cliquot. Apart from that it was lovely 

Thank you",4
"I expected a lot more for the price and location, it was a let down",2
I loved how the atmosphere felt when you walked out side safe in seaport and great people that always ask you if there is anything elts.,4
"I understand that it is COVID time and everybody is making precaution measures. But disposable tableware? Really? The place itself is nice, but this is very big disappointment for me. I had an anniversary date with my wife and was not told that they will serve EVERYTHING using disposable tableware. It is not hard to throw dishes in the dishwasher and other restaurants in Boston already serving food on regular tableware.",0
Went for brunch with the ladies for a friends birthday. The food was horrible and served in paper boxes. The drinks were mediocre and the waitstaff was rude. I had the Caesar salad the chicken was hard and cold. The only thing going for it is the view and decor inside. Definitely won‚Äôt be back.,0
"The view from the location is great however the food and the service are mediocre at best.  There were only 3 tables there while we were and still little attention was paid to our table, of only 2 people.  The food was served in cardboard boxes with plastic cutlery.  For the price it is definitely not worth it.",0
Beautiful views of the city and great food and drinks,4
It is not worth the expectation and the wait times,2
"The environment is great. It's such a cool place, and I imagine it must have been great in the summertime pre-covid. That said, it was a bad experience now. Despite being a ""nice"" place (and pretty expensive), everything was served in single-use disposable plastic. The $16 appetizer I ordered was served in a paper box that would only be justified if I had bought it from a food truck.  Also, the waiters gave us no warning that our table time was almost up, and 5 minutes after they served us another round of drinks, they asked us (rather intensely) to get up ""right away"" and leave because our time was up. Overall, not worth it. Would not recommend it.",1
They were very rude about the time limit and the food was actually bad.,2
Drinks were in plastic cups hardly full and food came in to go boxes. Very disappointing.,0
"Great view, great food (pork belly), great service, and perfect spot for a date night with your significant other!",4
"Amazing views, the balcony is amazing. Current brunch menu is basic but overall excellent value",3
Food was great. Location was fun.,4
We did not have a great experience at LookOut. I am not sure why they did not want to be friendly at all! They served our food on disposable containers while it is proved that using regular dishes does not lead to virus transmission. For sure I do not recommend this place.,0
I proposed to my new fianc√©.,4
"Amazing views, reasonably priced menu, very fun for brunch!",4
"Service was subpar. Our waiter came to our table probably 3 times in the 2 hours we were there and completely forgot to give us our drinks that we ordered. Also for the vibe of this place, the waiters did not fit the style and seemed very annoyed. Out of all the places we went to while visiting Boston, this was my least favorite.",2
Our server left us for about an hour and another server had to take over,1
Worst food and drinks. The value of such a great place with this amazing view is consumed by poor menu and quality. Very very overrated place do not even attempt to book.,0
Went for a birthday brunch with girlfriend. Amazing food and the view was phenomenal. The brunch cocktails were great as well. Highly recommend ‚ÄòRelease the Karen‚Äô for a boozy cocktail/coffee hybrid. Vanilla bourbon French toast was a hit with the girlfriend and I as well.,4
"We were served in plastic cups and the food came in the TO GO BOX! 
Servers almost never showed up and the prices were a bit too high for being served in plastic cups, utensils and the food on the to go box. 

Worst birthday brunch experience. We had a drink paid our bill and went to Gather. Much better experience!",0
Deanna our server was lights out! Made my birthday experience amazing!,4
"We had a group of 14 and during a pandemic it‚Äôs not easy to find someone to accommodate that many people. I emailed the general manager Josh, who got back to me right away and helped me make the reservation. The whole group had an amazing time and coming here made all three of our birthdays so special!",4
It was amazing and the music was cool.,4
"The rooftop has a great view and a nice location. However, the drinks are served in plastic cups. I know this might not be a big deal to some people, but if I‚Äôm out with my friends, celebrating a good week on a moderately expensive rooftop, and I order a $40 glass of scotch, I don‚Äôt want to have a plastic cup. The food, although delicious, comes in paper boxes on your table. 

When I arrived, the location and service were fantastic. However, over the course of the night, I realized that I‚Äôll probably never come back here. It‚Äôs one of the rare Boston locations that can really impress a date, family member, or friend‚Äîbut unfortunately this is ruined by plastic cups, paper boxes, and an overall low-effort atmosphere. I will gladly return when there are glasses and plates.",3
"Only thing we would complain about is the plastic cups. Not sure why they need to be plastic inside, for a $17 glass of wine.  

Everything else is great.",3
"We were outdoors on the couches under heat lamps. The view is amazing! Drinks were good and food is okay. A bit pricey, but you are paying for the view. Make a reservation for around sunset.",3
First of all this a bar not a restaurant. There is NO view except for a giant building. There are 10 menu items that are all disgusting. Do not waste your time.,0
Probably better in the spring/summer. Food is not a reason to visit.,2
"It was wonderful, I enjoyed it the day with my family there, we are trying to go again, perfect view ü•∞",4
"Food was great but service could be better. We didn‚Äôt feel welcomed, server was not attentive.",1
Host was on phone when I got there and didn‚Äôt realize I was standing right in front of him. Server took a while to come to our table even though we‚Äôd been sitting for a while. Drinks took a while to come to table. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be revisiting.,1
"Was under the impression this was the igloo experience 
Disappointed 

Also thought servicing food on paper and plastic plates was surprising",2
Our first time at the rooftop we sat ‚Äúinside‚Äù. The music was loud and the food was average. The prices were on the higher end but we expected it to be more expensive for the views. Friendly staff and good view. Just don‚Äôt go for the food.  The atmosphere is good for a party like event music was good for a hip dance crowd. On the louder side,3
Chicken was cold & over cooked. All meals came in boxes. Overpriced and too loud,0
"Menu was so small, not worth going for a meal, and with restrictions you can‚Äôt just go for a meal. A bit disappointing for the price",2
This is a hot spot. The food and service was great!,4
"The view is great. I‚Äôm pregnant so I liked that they had a list of mocktails. However, the service was extremely slow. The GM wouldn‚Äôt let my 30 year old husband have a drink because his NY license expired 2 months ago and NY DMVs have been closed - even though the NY government has publicly stated all expired IDs are still valid until 2/26/21 due to covid closings.",1
"The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to accommodate! Our server, Stephanie was a sweetheart. Super knowledgeable and patient. Our bartender, Brian was funny and had an amazing cocktail menu to select from. Locally sourced honey (he sourced it himself). The manager, Mike was very friendly and not your typical manager type. He genuinely cared about our experience there. Definitely will be back!",4
"We had a great experience here. Brian, the bartender waited on us and made a great spicy margarita. Although the drinks were a bit pricey and there was a limited menu, we still enjoyed it. I had read reviews so knew to expect plastic utensils and plates. If you like quiet, I wouldn't recommend. The view is perfect and fun people watching. It was a mild evening so we went outside for a bit. I will go back especially in the nice weather.",3
Great Views and upbeat vibe! They could use a few more servers and eating food out of paper carton was unexpected.,3
"Went for brunch, Everything was perfect as always. I had smoked salmon toast for the first time ever and I LOVE it, so bomb. My bf had the French toast and eggs, he demolished it lol",4
Didn‚Äôt realize the food would not be dinner portion sized,3
"Absolutely beautiful place, food was remarkably good and at a good price, and the cocktails were more than worth the money. The staff were friendly and respectful, and the seating felt pandemic-safe (even to someone as conservative about pandemic restrictions as I am). Would absolutely recommend.",4
The view of the harbor and city was great. The menu only offered appetizers. The food was served in take out containers with plastic implements and the drinks were all served in plastic cups. Very disappointing for such an upscale venue.,1
Birthday for a friend.   Everything was excellent. Wasn‚Äôt crazy about everything being served in a box.  Due to Covid I assume.   Everything was wonderful,4
"I‚Äôd loved it here! I came here with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday. Since the moment we walked in, the place was lively and I just knew we were going to have a great time. We sat inside near the door but the heating lamp over us did a great job keeping us warm. The drinks we great, the food was great and our service was outstanding. The music was throwback r&b mixed with a little pop that night I believe & it was unexpected but very well received... by the whole place. Everyone was singing and seemed to really be enjoying themselves. It was a great experience with a great view!",4
So fun ! We took beautiful pictures the drinks were great,4
"It‚Äôs completely unnecessary to serve drinks and food in paper and plastic containers for the price you‚Äôre paying. I understand Covid concerns, but that‚Äôs embarrassing for such a beautiful establishment. I had a great time, but that was quite disappointing.",3
"Great views, hospitality and service . Would recommend",4
The views are what makes this place great! The service was good and the food was yummy.  The food menu was very much like tapas & I had wished they had a burger or something along those lines (which they do on their afternoon menu).  I would go back again!,4
$98 for 4 shots and 2 beers. Service was great but $20 a shot...,2
It was a great place . One of the best views of Boston City,4
Beautiful rooftop in Seaport district. Vibrant space,4
I would have wished for more variety on the menu. The waitress also took too long to bring our check,4
Amazing!! Everything was over the top!,4
Honestly the staff was mean and very unfriendly wont be going back.,0
"2nd time here, and soon to go back.  Can't beat the view on the deck, the wind protection, the heat lamps, great food and service---for very reasonable prices.  Bathrooms are super clean with extra effort for hands free.  My farmer's omelette had grilled veggies---so good.  The homemade salsa is the best ever.  Next time I am bringing a little container to bring the rest of our salsa home, knowing our left over one would be thrown out..",4
"I would have appreciated knowing that my food would be in a to-go box especially with the price of the food. Also, my drink for the price was not good. Loved the view and the vibe was good, but the service and price for the food/drinks was not ideal.",1
It was great! Our waiter Alex was awesome and really great with our kids! It was a great place to spend New Year‚Äôs Eve morning!!!,4
"Service was poor, food was okay but the only good thing in this place is the view. I just recommend this place for the view.",1
Great food but terrible service. They were understaffed when we went. Saw our server at the beginning but then not again for the ENTIRE TIME we were there. Had to add up our bill and leave cash on the table and just leave because no server ever came to check on us.,1
"Everything was great! Loved it there. I just wish their dinner menu was bigger. They need more varieties of food. Other than that, the place was amazing. Staff was awesome!",3
"There was about 50 people crowded in a very small corridor. It was insane, given the pandemic. Food was good, but the service was so rushed and terrible. We had like 5 different waiters as well, none attentive. It was also very cold inside as well, and the door to the outside was left open many times.",1
"Very pleased with everything 
Safe social distancing",3
Cool place. Food was good. Service was not there. Our server forgot about us but someone else came to rescue. Overall good,3
Enjoyed my time! Will come again definitely. Beautiful,4
"Beautiful space, great views. Small menu, amazing hot chocolate. Only suggestion would be using real glassware, real plates. Disposable cups and plates take away from the experience.",3
Beautiful decor and views of Boston. We went at 3 pm so we saw the sun set. It was gorgeous. Very spacious. All staff and patrons wore masks.,4
"Good beer 
Very nice view
Waiter very nice.
Not to expensive",4
"During my short trip to Boston I went to grab some drink at the @lookout rooftop. I would recommend to everyone to stop by since every read perfect! The place, the design, the view, the drink and the food, the staff!",4
Outstanding service and ambience!!!,4
"Food was not at all good. It's an overpriced place just for the ambience. If you are going for the food, you will not enjoy",1
It was so awesome food was tasty ! Great options and incredible service,4
Awesome place with great views and drinks,4
"Great scenery. Limited food choices, more like finger foods and not much to choose from. Not sure if it‚Äôs due to COVID but will give 2 over 10 for food",3
"It was my birthday and no one sung happy birthday and I added that into my reservation notes so that was very poor. I should have gave a 1 star but I am being nice. When it got cold out, it felt like an insult when they moved us inside right at the door so I was still freezing. Then my brother in law got into a small situation when he asked to use another pen to sign the receipt because the pen he was using didn't work, another waitress said something about it. We had to get up and leave. We are very nice people and we should have been treated better. Thank you.",1
"Todo super cool y rico, voy a volver",4
Best French toast i think I've ever had! Definitely took me by surprise! The view was amazing and the heaters did their job!,4
"Food was delicious, COVID precautions were good and prices were reasonable. Service was very friendly but a little slow.",3
Awesome when you are sitting outside!,3
TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! The food was priced so high yet served in biodegradable paper trays and drinks served in plastic cups....even an expensive martini. SUCH A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE for the price.,0
The receptionist had a bad attitude,2
"Overall experience was okay. The service nothing special, the food very limited items, only thing worth it was the view.",2
The waitress was amazing but slim picking for dinner. Mostly appetizers.,4
"This place is AWESOME!!! From the ambiance, to the service. The food is great and fantastic drinks. I had Stephanie as my server and she was an absolute sweetheart. Iona was the hostess that evening and was just as lovely! It was a great experience and I can‚Äôt wait to return! :)",4
"Nice vibe. Great service and I enjoyed the food by my brother, delicious.",4
"Wait for almost an hour to get seated even if we already had a reservation. We do understand the situation of weather or no matter what, Should tell us earlier about their shortage of seats... just a call would be fine actually.",0
We had 8:00 reservations for a party of 5 (4 adults 1 child). Upon arrival I checked in with the hostess who informed me there would be a 15-20 minute wait. After 45 minutes I went back and spoke with an older man and explained that we had been waiting 45 min although we had been told 15-20 min wait. He told me that due to the cold weather they had downsized their tables from 80 to 12 inside dining. I told him that if I had known I would have to wait 1 hour for a table I would not have remained. We had a child in our dinner party and that was totally unfair treatment. After an hour wait we were sent upstairs to dine. The food was okay and the service was not attentive. Btw even after I spoke with the gentleman I overheard the hostess and him telling new patrons there would be a 15 minute wait. This practice of lying to customers regarding wait time is unconscionable. I shall never return to this restaurant. They are polite liars.,0
"The service here is terrible, and I will never be going back. The server was rude and we were seated until an hour after our reservation time.",0
Had to wait a long time Bc snow ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,1
We don‚Äôt like it! Very bad! I hope that you guys improve the reception!,0
Love the view!,4
"What a great place to go for a drink, we went when it was snowing but we were kept nice and warm within the enclosure with the heaters. The staff were fantastic and the drinks and food were very nice. 10/10 would return and would recommend.",4
"I love this place  amazing, i and my son enjoyed there,nive views, drink especially food the bes.thank you.",4
"This place was awesome!! Staff was so nice, food was good and the view was amazing!!!!! Highly recommend.",4
We had a amazing time! Everything was magnificent. The view was everything,4
Beautiful!! Great for a birthday - a little disappointed by the to-go containers for food though.,4
"I had an amazing time, I definitely would return .",3
"I had a great time. The food and drinks seemed overpriced for the quality and quantity. However, it was evident that you paid for the view.",2
"The atmosphere is great, you are looking out over the water, and have the most beautiful view of Boston. The menu was extremely limited and paper (which no restaurant has at the moment) we looked at the menu online and when ordering got instructed that the paper menu is the only option, and the server seemed annoyed with us. All through our meal, we felt as if the staff wanted to flip the table rather than having us stay to eat and drink more. We never got asked if we wanted a second beverage or anything else but instead got the check dropped off, making us feel rushed. This was a special day for us as my engagement was being celebrated and my birthday and I'm highly disappointed... want to come back due to the view but hope experience overall will be better. Willing to give this place a second chance.",2
"Excellent views, great location. The patio is decorated really nice. Not enough heater coverage if cold and windy. All bar food and very greasy but good for drinks. Everything was served in disposable due to COVID-19, including wine. Not very convenient if you are looking to have food. Our server was very nice but the manager was an anxiety ball. After 90 min, we wanted to be respectful and asked for check. Server was busy so it took her another 15 min to get the check. Manager comes over and was a bit rude to my husband, without knowing it was the delay at their end. Regardless, would recommend it.",3
Marg was spiiiiiicy,4
"Service was very unwelcoming and made us feel uncomfortable for even being there- server was rude and didn‚Äôt communicate with us. Drinks and food were great, however!",2
Our waitress was good but one of the managers was rude and unprofessional. We asked to be seated at a different table next to the heaters and we understood that it was a busy place with reservations only but the way the message was delivered to us was rude and unprofessional. The manager on duty that night did not service our request with kindness. She was blunt and mean unfortunately. Other than that the place and ambiance was good and beautiful.,0
Only the view along the alley is excellent but we were unfortunately not seated there.,3
"The restaurant isn‚Äôt as  advertised. We had to sit inside because they overbooked our reservation.. and we did not get to sit outside or enjoy the ‚ÄúLookout Rooftop‚Äù. Also, bartenders don‚Äôt wear their masks correctly.",1
If you want a simple bite to eat with drinks and an amazing view Rooftop is a great option.,4
"Food  quality doesn‚Äôt meet expectations of that place. Super expensive for value you get. 
Drinks great! View great!",3
We sat on the rooftop and it was awesome! Great snacks and drinks and a great way to make a night feel festive and fun,4
"Disappointed in our seating. Made reservations several weeks ago for 5 pm. When we  arrived, we got seated on the backside and not even along the edge where there was a nice view of the water, no  heaters or fires on our area either.. When leaving I saw the prime seating. How early do you need to make a reservation or leave to get a nice spot? Maybe you need to be a regular or slide a big tip to everyone prior to being seated.",1
Ambiance was perfect! Drinks were delicious! Amazing spot to go to if you‚Äôre visiting Boston!,4
The woman downstairs ended up checking us in for our reservation but made us wait in the lobby for 30 min bc we were early. We got there at 8:30 and reservations were at 9. She never came in to get us so i walked up to her at 9pm and it seemed like she completely forgot about us and told us we can go upstairs to the roof bar. When we got upstairs the hostess was confused bc it said we checked in at 8:30 and she was extremely rude about it. Then we get seated INSIDE... the only reason why we wanted to go was bc it‚Äôs a roof top bar and we wanted a nice view. We asked her if we can go outside and she said nothing is available. Also they only give you a 1.5 hour time limit and we were sitting for at least 20 min and no one walked up to us to get our order so we left. Such a waste of time.. i would never go there again after that experience.,0
"Poor service, rude hostesses and not worth the money, since there‚Äôs only a ‚Äúchance‚Äù you‚Äôll get a table with a view and the food is subpar.",0
Awesome night despite being fogged in! Next time we will enjoy the view - still fun üòÄ,4
"Venue was physically nice. Food ok but not substantial. Weather is unpredictable, extremely foggy. No view. Management cavalier with COVID protections!!  Allowed large group, 20+ to overwhelm one end of restaurant. Groups of 8 ant 10 crowded around couches designated for 6. This breaks protocol. Should be reported to state. Very unsafe for wait staff and those seated near.",1
"The vibe, food, and drinks were great. Not many options for other dietary restrictions. Would still recommend for a cute date or night out with the girls",2
place was good but drinks and service were not upto the par,2
"Our waiter was very rude and disrespectful to us. Never took our order and kept walking by us as we were saying we were ready to order.
Left without eating",0
Your staff are friendly & work together well as a team. The facility is very clean. The music was good & energetic. The view was everything. Thank you all.,4
"Very friendly staff , food menu not a lot of options . They should definitely have chicken wings on the menu for late nite . Fries and drinks very yummy. The waiter was great and kept asking us if we needed anything , very welcomed . The view was beautiful too !",3
"It was chaotic. The food is extremely overpriced and you only have 3 dinner options. Came out late and we had to remind multiple staff members about it. Couldn‚Äôt tell who our server was and the workers weren‚Äôt wearing matching uniforms. Very disorganized and the drinks are $18 where you get a plastic cup and half of it is filled with ice. 

You are strictly paying for the view so if u want a meal and a photo, you‚Äôre basically going to pay $120 for that photo.",0
"incredible view, incredible service. this is THE rooftop spot in Boston",4
"Beautiful, breathtaking Boston harbor views
Servers were constantly cleaning",4
Great place to eat and hang out safely (ie COVID). Looking forward to going back when the igloos are set up!,4
It rained on us that night but it was still very beautiful.,4
Apathetic service unfortunately,0
"Very loud, sat us at the one table where the heater was broken but thankfully wasn‚Äôt too cold. The food menu was limited and  shrimp cocktail ‚Äúdinner‚Äù was 5 pieces for 16$ but overall it was good food and great ambiance!",4
"Too many young people getting hammered so early in the day. Not a good look, felt like  chi I was at a day club.",2
"The quality of the food was much better than expected, but for a place that markets itself as posh and for those seeking a high quality food, drink, and ambience experience, it is surprising to walk in and realize all food and drink is served in disposable containers. Maybe he was not having a good day, but our waiter also seemed like he'd much rather be somewhere else.",2
My boyfriend and I stopped through Hudson on a whim having never been there before. We read great reviews,4
My reservation was for 1015 and I arrived for 1010 and we didn‚Äôt get seated until 11pm. What‚Äôs the point of making a reservation if I can‚Äôt be seated timely,0
"Excellent nachos, tacos, and tostadas. Everything was organized well for COVID regulations.",4
The host was not too helpful as she seated us on a table that had poor view.we had to ask to get to seated a nicer table,3
Very nice ambiance and beautiful views of the Boston skyline,4
"The view is absolutely spectacular, however I recommend this place for just drinks the food menu was average having your typical burger and Caesar salad items. I‚Äôd love to see some creativity and make the gastronomy more of an experience.",2
"View was beautiful, staff was kind and even made us some great drinks. Food menu was very small. Being a vegan I only really had one option. Which was very good but wish there was more to pick from.",4
"The menu was the weakest link, here: the drinks and plates are rather boring, and you will pay more here than you would for comparable food elsewhere. In essence, you are paying for the view, which is admittedly nice, rather than the food. I have no complaints about the service; everyone I spoke to was helpful.",3
"The view cannot be beat, the service was great and the food was very tasty.  Honestly, its the other patrons that detract from the experience especially with them ignoring many COVID regulations, despite the staff's best efforts to make sure they are compliant.",2
Food was tasty but food portions were small. Drinks are alright but not a lot of options in general. The place definitely doesn‚Äôt live up to the hype. Overrated.,2
"The environment was very good.
Good service, but the food choices was very very poor.
Also the elegance, serving plastic cups, and paper plates for serving food very bad.
Overall was good but I was expecting more",2
Such a gorgeous view and beautiful place to soak in a nice day.,4
Male waiter was given too many tables to tend to and could not provide us much attention throughout my brunch.,2
Food was mediocre for the price. The staff wasn‚Äôt very attentive and the menu was not big. The best part was the view.,2
"I took my husband for his birthday there, he enjoyed his time there. Food and rhe music was great.",4
"Awesome night! Great service and atmosphere! The waitress was fantastic :) 
Looking forward to going back real soon!",4
"Very beautiful rooftop for ambiance, service was just alright. We weren't informed the rooftop closed between 4-5 and our check was simply dropped off with no questions or words exchanged.",3
Amazing views and drinks! So fun to go to with friends visiting the city. Definitely make reservations ahead of time.,3
"The view and service was great with a beautiful atmosphere! My Caesar salad however had old lettuce and old tomatoes on it. The chicken was tasty but not worth the $9 up charge. 

I would definitely attend again but order something else!",2
"Enjoyed my time there, except they didn't tell me i could only have my table for 90min. That would've been nice to know, and i would've adjusted. My server was very non-attentive. He seemed to be interested in his other tables, and wasn't rushing them even though they were there longer than us. Beautiful place to get drinks and apps, but the service doesn't match. The places i went after were by far better in the service department.",2
Excellent view and the food was delicious! I especially love how they had the heated lamps in case it was chilly.,4
"Manager racially profiled us, repeatedly tried to spread our group apart and blamed it on Marty and COVID but there were two other groups of white with 7 or 8 people",4
"over expensive for no reason, not guaranteed a spot with a view, was told there would be fire pits, there were none. was told i would feel heater, i did not. drinks are tiny and over priced",1
"Perfect view, the truffle fries were amazing and my friends loved them!",4
"Allow me to preface with the fact that obviously, Lookout Rooftop has a spectacular view. However, the cheaply made, watered-down drinks were served in plastic cups, and the food was third-world-country terrible. It's upsetting that a hotel this beautiful with a rooftop that gorgeous would stoop to such lows.",1
"The staff were great, and when it started to rain let us move to a covered table. which normally I would not consider a great, but simply what was required, given the pandemic allowing us to switch table (ie limiting the number of tables they now had) was great service in my opinion. Wonderful view of the skyline, but you are definitely paying for the view.",4
Great scenery but slightly pricey for what is served.,3
"I wanted to love this place, but the second we came off the elevator we were met with a very rude host.  My wife and I were staying at the hotel and had made reservations for the lookout rooftop bar at 9:30pm.  We told the rude host that we had reservations for two and she asked if we had checked in downstairs.  We told her no, that we were staying at the hotel and just came from our room.  Why would you have to check in downstairs is you already have access to the rooftop with your hotel key?  She said the only table they had available was one with no view and right next to the bar and exit.  We asked her if we could wait for another table to open up that had actually had a view and she said to sit at that table until one became available.  After about 30 minutes and us watching her seat  at least 15 other parties another very nice hostess came over and got us to move to a table that actually had a view.  The rude host wouldn't even acknowledge us anymore.  However, the night was already ruined.  You would think that if a hotel only has one bar and restaurant open they would give guests staying at the hotel a little preferential treatment.  All of the other staff were nice and cordial so that's why the two stars.",1
"Poor quality food and drink, not good at all.
I just enjoyed the view and music.",1
"Amazing place for hang out with friends, I recommend",4
Great spot for a snack and drink. I loved the service and the location. It was great environment and the views were spectacular. Food options are more like finger foods tapas style snacks and not a typical sit down dinner restaurant. The drinks were tasty and our waitress was awesome. Ordered 4 drinks and 3 items off the menu which totaled about $100. Prices are slightly high for the type of food being served but ultimately you are paying for the views and atmosphere.,3
Great view and drinks. Their food menu lacks variety and is very overpriced and it is served in to go boxes?! Not what i was expecting  for a special occasion.,2
"Great view, great service, and very good food at reasonable price.",4
"The location and view was great . I think the music was little loud . The server was not attentive at all . When I asked for second glass of water she brought warm water ! Then I asked for ice , took her a while . 
Drinks were not that great either . My sandwich was delicious, not a lot of choices in lunch menu . 
The view is something that I might go back üëç",3
I went to Lookout Rooftop for my birthday celebration and had a great time! The view is beautiful and the food is great. Will definitely be back and would definitely recommend!,4
"Food could have been much better, but you pay for the view.",4
"Perfect, as always. Envoy never disappoints! And fries on a rooftop is never a bad thing.",4
Very elegant place with an excellent view. Only thing I didnt like about the food service was everything was served in cardboard boxes. That did not sit well with me due to the classiness of the establishment. They should definitely think about some other was to serve to food. Other than that I loved the ambiance and will definitely recommend it to others.,4
"Nice ambiance being on a rooftop with amazing views. However, the music is too loud for us to have a decent conversations with friends I haven‚Äôt seen in a year. Food is ok. Service is attentive.",3
"Spectacular view, awesome ambiance!",4
"The view of Boston is amazing and so was my lobster roll. Kind of on the pricey side, but nothing too crazy. Worth it bc of the location. Definitely want to go back with a group of friends bc they have a cute lounging couches that looked nice!",3
"Had a reservation but still had to wait for a table, expensive weak drinks, expensive small food - all plastics and paper plates",3
Great view from the rooftop and the food was delicious! Great service,4
Awesome views- more of a drinking spot vs food.  I would suggest grabbing a drink & some light apps.,3
"I‚Äôve been here at least once per week all summer. The best outdoor dining, view, vibe in the city.",4
The view is stunning. Food is okay but overpriced. Overall it‚Äôs a good spot if you want to enjoy the beautiful view of Boston.,4
"This is a great roof deck with a great view.  That‚Äôs what you‚Äôre paying for.  Food was fine, nothing really was a ‚Äòwow‚Äô.  Overpriced for what you get (lunch for two with no drinks was $75).",2
date night was amazing,4
It was very nice and we stayed at the hotel for 3 night i wish there was more opening to go to the roof top when you stay with envoy.,3
Beautiful view and ambiance.  Would recommend for overall rooftop experience.  A bit pricey for the small plates and drinks but nice experience.  Strong drinks were a plus!,3
"The service was outstanding, the view was fabulous. I would recommend this to friends 

However, I am conflicted about returning   I was appalled by all the plastic: glass of champagne served in plastic, plastic utensils, plastic water glass. 10 pounds of plastic!

Well I understand this may be necessary for the pandemic, 99%Of restaurants we visit, I‚Äôm not drowning in plastic.  this is so harmful and detrimental to the environment.  

We are sad, Because overall it was an outstanding visit.",3
"I had a fish sandwich and it was great. very friendly and quick service, nice atmosphere and beautiful view. The noise level was a little too loud for the talk between few people.
But overall very good experience!
Thank you!",4
One of the most beautiful places in Boston..I loved it..It is more like a bar so they don't have a look of variety on the menu.Most like bar food.But the view is everything üòç,4
Very limited menu with poor selection at dinner time. Their lunch menu looked better. Views were stunning but this was noth worth it.,1
"The view was awesome! The drinks were on point, overall great place for a day date!",4
"The views are outstanding. Comfort level is good, although the music on a Sunday morning was loud and better suited for the evening crowd. The heater helped, but as Fall progresses, it will be too cold on the rooftop to sit at the perimeter tables.(The inner booths may provide less exposure to the elements.) The food was very good despite the limited menu. Our server was attentive, had a good grasp of how the food was prepared, and was very personable.",3
"Nice view, expensive for what you get, potato chips are the side. Drinks also quite expensive. To be expected in Boston I guess.",2
"Very poor service, the lady who brought our food in paper boxes was very rude.
The place and the view is amazing but not good service and the food nothing special. 
My first time there and I was expecting to have a good time.  They service us with plastic plates plastic utensils and the food came in paper boxes.  And the close the check in 90 minutes, literally they kicking you out after 90 minutes.  But I didn‚Äôt mind because I wasn‚Äôt having a good time.  I will try again and hope will be better next time.",2
Terrible and rude server.,3
It's a great place with a great view. Definitely recommend making reservations ahead of time as it is pretty busy,4
Anniversary,4
It was just as expected. Nice ambience and super pretty views at night,4
Good vibes and strong drinks. Love their playlist. The view at night is great for a friend gathering. Can‚Äôt wait to come back and do brunch.,4
First time being on the rooftop was really nice!,4
"The view was amazing, the food and service were also great!! Will definitely go back!! We loved it ! The vibe aaa fun and hip and loved the music!",4
Slow service and the food was very bland.,2
Gorgeous view & excellent food! Would recommend for weekend lunch/brunch!,4
We had a reservation for 9:15 & unfortunately won‚Äôt seated till 9:35. My waiter was amazing but service took too long.,2
"EXCELLENT place
worth the tip
Great service 
clean",4
it was awesome!!!,4
"The location is really amazing, we were able to experience an awesome sunset. The service is also good and the price reasonable. Definitely something that I would love to try again when the pandemic is over.",3
It was great,3
"I really enjoyed the views but the music was too way loud. I had trouble hearing conversation at my table and our table was difficult to eat on with the short tables and lounge chairs. I recommend taking a table with a normal chair! The food was expensive but great service, really friendly staff.",3
I had a great experience! The food as great and the views were incredible! Absolutely the place to impress out of town friends. Service was on point and I loved the drink suggestions. I liked I didn't feel rush and our waiter was super nice. Definitely will come back,4
Perfect rooftop patio in Boston. Food and service was great.,4
Server was amazing!,3
"Food isn‚Äôt the best but the view is beautiful and the restaurant it self is very nice, the waitresses are super nice. Would recommend for the experience not for the food",3
Great spot,4
"Totally blown away. Staff were AMAZING and very kind, professional, friendly! Our guest of honor was delayed due to transportation, but that was taken in stride and we were treated with understanding and our reservation salvaged. Food came quick. The ambiance is one of a kind!",4
"I loved it, went back for a second time in a month",3
"We had a great time, amazing views, we will be going back!",4
Outstanding experience! Great views! Would definitely recommend!,4
"We got a ‚Äúview‚Äù table so we were right there to watch over the city, it was so beautiful. The burger and fries BOMB. Order it, won‚Äôt be disappointed.. we were there late so the menu was limited but it‚Äôs literally the only burger on there. So good. Our server was great too, forgot her name but she was sweet!",4
Our waitress overlooked us a few times but was friendly. Food was really good and the space/view is amazing.,3
It was a celebration of my bday and it was a wonderful evening!,4
Great atmosphere and food! No bad view!!,4
"Beautiful view, amazing food and great service. Definitely will be come back.  Highly recommend!",4
"Beautiful view, great drinks, awesome music!",4
"The cocktails were a let down. The beer selection was minimal. Overall, have had better experiences through this covid pandemic.",2
"Being a rooftop, the view was beautiful however the loud frat music was such an disappointment. It wasn't relaxing or cool at all. Maybe it was our luck sitting next to a group of collage kids in combination with the music was just not what I was expecting from the evening. We got 3 drinks and 2 appetizers= $85. They were serviced in a paper box with plastic utensils and drinks in plastic cups. Did it worth the view? For you to decide.
The service was very friendly which was great!",2
"Great atmosphere, view, service and drinks! Would recommend",4
"The menu is underwhelming, the service was bad (told me I couldn't put something in as an appetizer - I was a server for 6 years during college so I know that's just you being lazy), my burger was salty, and the price for what  you get is outrageous. The only redeeming quality was the view, and the friendliness of the hostess.",1
Last minute reservation made well. Staff was friendly and accommodating.,4
"It was a lovely view from the table. Went around sunset and doomed to a view of old Boston lighting up and the skies changing color. 

The food was quick to come and was delicious. The truffle fries were amazing. They were following COVID protocols and the utensils were also disposable.",3
Loved the Lookout. Very safe experience in this COVID era. Server was attentive and was working with several tables. Beautiful view to go along with cold beers and great truffle fries.,4
"Finally checked out this place after a few years of living in Boston. 
First: Great social distancing and COVID precautions. You will not be crowded here. Staff was very nice and attentive. 
We got a great table with an amazing view. Cocktails were $16/piece which was fine with me for such a great view. The sangria tasted like juicy-juice but the other cocktails we had were great. The food was not good- cookout, picnicky food in small portions- and very expensive. I know they are probably doing their best as a bar but it was definitely a little bit of a buzzkill. All food/drinks came in disposable plastic or cardboard dinnerware (which I didn't love as a diner but totally get it and am happy they are protecting their staff). 

In sum: totally worth it for the drinks alone and the service, view, and ambiance made me ok with paying a lot for meh food. However, you might be disappointed if you planned a special event or dinner date here because the food is lacking. In regards to COVID-19, you will feel very safe and have plenty of space with the precautions they have in place.",3
Amazing view and great drinks! Super accommodating staff! Got engaged at the end of the night at the balcony and it was perfect,4
Great drinks! Beautiful View! Friendly staff! Thank you!,4
"We needed to add another member to our party so I called the number listed by the restaurant on the reservation. I tried calling five times in advance, no answer or voicemail. When I arrived at the restaurant and asked to add another person, they said no (our party was six and it needed to be seven but due to COVID they wouldn‚Äôt allow us to add one) and then when I referenced that I tried to call in advance multiple times they said ‚Äúoh well that just rings to the hotel downstairs‚Äù and brushed it off. I understand there are rules due to Covid, but if they had answered their phone or listed a number they actually answered, I would have known that in advance. After we told our one friend they couldn‚Äôt join us, we did finally get to our table and service took forever so we ordered a bottle a piece and left anyway. I would recommend they list a number that rings to the restaurant or a person who can assist. The view was gorgeous but we were not impressed by the hospitality.",1
I came here for my birthday first time ever and was super excited. Unfortunately it wasn‚Äôt the best experience. My reservations were for 3:30 and was rushed to order because they close right away to then get ready for dinner. That was the most unpleasant part bearing that I was there for my birthday travels from RI to get seated for 30 mins. A heads up prior to booking would‚Äôve been appreciated. The menu was very small and limited for such a beautiful place. Ambiance was nice but service doesn‚Äôt match. Nothing special for birthday either.,2
The service was horrible. Nobody answered the phones for the 30 minutes when I tried getting ahold of them.,4
"They have 90 minutes reservation policy, but they kicked us out in 50 min as soon as we finished our first drink. We needed to keep on ordering or we cannot sit quietly. This is ridiculous and unacceptable.",0
"Best roof deck in Boston! Beautiful view, great staff, excellent drinks.",4
It was fab for 30,4
"Sux, The way to rose ridiculous the menu was weak Anna was overall over price",0
"Like other said, it felt like I was in high school clubin. Food was great, although limited menu? waitress nice, hostesses no smile nor hi or bye....hello u there? 

Sure the view is great, but u can get that plenty of other places in beantown. 

All in all..it was good.",3
The views and atmosphere are fantastic.  The service was excellent all around.  The portions were a bit small for the price but very tasty and presentation for outside was fun!  First time here and very glad we came.,4
"Go!  Just go!You will not regret it , so beautiful up there.",4
The place is awesome. My friend and I loved the viewed and the services. I really recomen Lookout Rooftop. We had a great time . Thanks You so much!,4
"The rooftop was great, the only thing is I didn‚Äôt know who was who, the staff wear regular cloths, Jeans and button shirt like a lot of the customers.",3
"I don‚Äôt u detest and how washing dishes during a pandemic  is hard work or unsanitary. I‚Äôm sorry but when you are paying  $16 for a cocktail and over $25 fir a Caesar salad you don‚Äôt expect to be eating out of a cardboard box and plastic cutlery. I get it‚Äôs the city, the ambiance and  overpricing but there is no treason why u cannot use real plates and real cutlery fir those prices. That‚Äôs ridiculous!! Don‚Äôt blame Covid either I have seen that 99 percent of the restaurants that are open who charge those kind of prices are not eating out of a cardboard box. I could go to Mcdonalds fir that, that‚Äôs just being overcome with fear and really taking advantage of the consumer. Wish I had taken a photo of my Caesar salad in a box which was so hard to cut while inside of a box. Get it together people are paying huge prices and we deserve better",2
Awesome time. Delicious food. Amazing view!,4
Love it here! The setup was awesome and the service was great too,4
Great place to go with friends or just a date. The people are welcoming and staff is great. Can‚Äôt forget about the food and the view. It‚Äôs amazing. Overall a fantastic place to be.,4
"Good experience, would definitely go back!",4
This is a cute spot for a nice scenery. I enjoyed it. I would like to come back and experience the place without regulations.,3
"Ambience was great,except that drinks are served in plastic cups and food in a to go box.Also very expensive.",3
"Lookout seems like a cool place for a younger crowd. I‚Äôm in my 30s and felt a bit old there. Their menu is being served in to-go containers, as well as cocktails in plastic cups. I was hoping to be impressed, especially bc the scenery is so beautiful from their rooftop. My friends did not last long here at all.
I‚Äôd recommend this place to anyone under 30 that wants a great backdrop to their photos.",3
View and service were excellent.  Food was and cocktails were not good for the price point.,2
"For a fun roof top experience, definitely head to Lookout!",4
"This is a nice place to grab a drink, maybe an appetizer, and enjoy the view. We liked the guacamole and the view is beautiful. The service is not fantastic--they are very nice but maybe too many people/not enough waitstaff for a Friday afternoon--but this is not unlike most rooftop bars you go to. Overall worth a trip!",3
"Nice day, great views. Music a little too loud but a good playlist. $25 lobster rolls were good but not great. Service is different with a variety of servers stopping to check on us. All in all we would definitely go back",4
Service was the worst I‚Äôve ever experienced . Management can‚Äôt deliver on promises and then are not accommodating whatsoever.,0
Unbelievable place for drinks and a bite. Views are simply beyond compare. Service was great. Will definitely be returning. This is a must for anyone visiting Boston!,4
"Excelent view and atmosphere, food just ok, no much too choose from.",3
"The view and overall experience was excellent! 

The bad - why kick people out after an hour and a half if you have NO ONE outside and EVERY 15 minutes available for a new reservation on OpenTable? We had ordered dinner and drinks for our group of 6 and the waitress/manager flat out lied about people waiting.",2
Great spot. No regrets.. definitely going back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,4
The staff was so friendly and kind. Loved the drinks,4
"- View is great 
- price fair
- Service was poor, not friendly at all.
- Menu for Dinner and snacks small
- Homepage states clearly a dress-code, almost nobody follows it. Even the waiter did not follow it, which is not a good example at all.",1
Beautiful view and there were umbrellas available to shield us from the light mist. Still had a wonderful evening even though the weather wasn't superb.,4
"amazing view, great staff!",4
Everything was perfect. I informed our server that it was our anniversary and she came over with champagne on the house. I thought that was sweet. The server was amazing and extremely knowledgeable of the menu and drink list. Overall it was a 10 out of 10 experience.,4
great place for drinks and a view of boston. i definitely recommend going here.,4
"90 minute reservation because of COVID 19. Fun Atmosphere,  great view, yummy food. The burger was delicious.  I thought the waitress took long to come back to clean the table once we finished our food so I trashed it myself.",3
Phenomenal space! Staff was beyond accommodating in these unknown times.,4
Sons birthday,4
"We had a wonderful lunch date here during a recent visit to Boston. The venue can‚Äôt be beat and the food and service, as well as Brian, the bartender, were all outstanding!",4
Anniversary Lunch,4
"The lady who checked us in was rude. She stated it was reservations only so I kindly asked to see if there was any room she started talking to the next guests over me! I was shocked. I ended up making one on my phone through open table and she seemed angry that i was able to do that. She had us wait inside, and kept having other parties go up that checked in. Never seen anything like it. Once we got upstairs, our server was extremely accommodating and nice. The view was incredible.",3
Loved the ambiance at Lookout! So fun! Probably the best rooftop in Boston.,4
great spot for 21st birthday to start!,4
My sister was celebrating her 21st birthday and she was happy and we had a lot of fun. The view was spectacular and the staff was super nice.,4
Great experience especially in the COVID world,4
"We had a great experience at the Lookout Rooftop!
Beautiful ambiance with fantastic views of downtown Boston!
Excellent service always!
A must see if you haven't been!üíØüéºü•Ç",4
"Great spot for drinks, views and quick food/snacks!",4
We enjoyed our drinks and appetizer! The view and atmosphere were amazing!,4
Amazing experience with unbeatable views of Boston on a Saturday night. Music was energetic and our server was so great to us. Had drinks and fries in the late night menu. Would come back again!,4
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the place is amazing! View is cool, drinks are alright not the best, BUT not in the middle of this pandemic, my bad, I thought they were going to be as strict any other restaurants I‚Äôve been to, but literally there‚Äôs people walking around without masks everywhere. and no one gives a damn. Like we left right away because we didn‚Äôt feel safe. I get it, I‚Äôm in a bar, but I‚Äôve been to other bars that have great enforced measures. If you‚Äôre careless about the pandemic overall is a good experience. But definitely NOT safe or controlled AT ALL. It‚Äôs actually really obnoxious. Also the host was kinda mean, who cares? But just saying.",1
"Very impressed with my dinner. Ambiance was very upbeat, drinks and food were fantastic. A little shocked that i paid almost $20 for my meal to come in a takeout container. Other than that, i loved everything",4
"This was my best experience at a restaurant since quarantine started. The staff was great! Polite, friendly, and geared towards creating a great experience for the guests. The atmosphere was exceptional, as they have an amazing view and super upbeat, energetic music, as well! Can't wait to go back!",4
"We had a great time. Katie was very helpful and kind to us, and so was our waitress! Glad we came. Thanks again.",4
It Was a nice time and would love to go there more often,4
"Great views, comfy seating and overall fun vibe. The staff at the Lookout are what makes it standout. The are managers keep everyone happy by making sure they are well taken care of. Even with all the Covid restrictions they managed to make my 21st birthday celebration extra special. Would highly recommend!",4
"Best rooftop view in Boston! The drinks are fabulous, I loved the SWEET SUNNY SOUTHIE.",4
The atmosphere was lovely. very nice view from the balcony.,4
Great time on the rooftop overlooking Boston with awesome cocktails. Ayana was wonderful setting us up with the best table! Will be back!,4
Girls night out!!,4
"We had a very enjoyable early afternoon on TheLookout Rooftop...the View was awesome, it was very clean and followed all Pandemic protocols, clean restrooms (although I wish they provided paper towels vs air dryers....), the drinks were excellent and reasonably priced...overall a great couple of hours enjoying the air, sunshine, & views of Boston....we‚Äôll be back ....thank you!",4
Had no complaints. Great view and affordable food.,4
Loved it! We enjoyed the food and the views! Would reccomend,4
"We came here during lunch hours when they first opened.  It was quiet and the view was wonderful.  The drinks were good.  The menu is small, not many options to choose from, however, the food we did have was amazing.  The fish and lobster were fresh and seasoned well.  The Angus burger was juicy and seasoned as well.  We could've ate 2 more baskets of the truffle fries.  An overall great choice and we'd definitely come again if ever in Boston.",4
Service wasn't that great from reception to sitting and being served. But ambiance is absolutely amazing,3
Took a long time to place orders and drinks too. But food was great. The place ran smooth and very clean. Will return. The host was incredible.,3
Didn't get our drinks until after we finished eating.,0
"Overpriced burgers with chips. Waitresses are nice. You'll be paying for the view. Very little choices in the menu. Found no sanitizer in the dispenser near the elevator. The guy at the reception desk super not helpful and plain. First time there, I was not impressed.",1
"1. Food in boxes seems I am eating in Salad bar in super market, but price is more expensive.

2. Staff is not friendly.

3. Drinks in plastic cups is not good idea, it is not fast food cafe.",2
It was beautiful my husband and I really enjoyed it,4
Nice view but service was really slow... do make sure to order 2 drinks at a time,2
So much fun!,4
"Beautiful view, they took my reservation for the rooftop weeks in advance, good music, drinks and a memorable night. Nice server. Definitely recommend",4
Amazing views and extremely attentive service. We will definitely return.,4
Very fun!  Great view,4
The service was great and our waitress was awesome! Will definitely go back,3
"Beautiful setting on the water.  They close between 4-5pm to clean, so if you have a late afternoon reservation you will be rushed to finish up by 4pm.",3
It was amazing,3
perfect outing for any event. nice view and even greater service,4
"The server doesn‚Äôt come much to the tables to see how things are going or to ask for anything else. Expected more choices of food. But overall had an ok time,",2
Worth the beautiful view! Food was limited and okay! Drinks were good! Service was good! We will return for those views,4
Beautiful views. Food was just ok I had the ceasar salad with chicken but it was a bit bland. Service was fine. I‚Äôll go back but it‚Äôs all about the views.,3
Birthday celebration,1
"Beautiful location; one of the best in Boston! Retirement luncheon couldn‚Äôt have been better. Professional atmosphere, classy clientele with upscale drink selection (but smaller food choices). Best views of Boston over the harbor from the expansive patio seating. Great send off to our Boston area office chief moving abroad.",3
Best views in the Seaport area. My friends and I had so much fun. Great drinks as well.,4
Felt great,4
Were able to get a nice shady spot next to the bar. Waitress was super nice and helpful. Good vibe and great scenery !,4
"Just came for drinks and the view so can't comment on the food. But, the drinks and view were amazing! Highly recommend coming here for drinks.",4
"Amazing time! Stephanie and crew were wonderful! We had a wonderful time this afternoon. Everyone was super friendly, polite, and helpful from the moment we arrived. We were seated quickly, food and drinks arrived quickly and I don‚Äôt think we could‚Äôve have asked for a better afternoon!",4
Wonderful drinks and a great view of the city!,4
"Our waitress Stephanie was spectacular at making the girlfriends birthday special, will definitely be returning time and time again",4
"It was amazing! Perfect view, delicious food",4
"We loved the vibe and the view.  The menu was abbreviated because of the virus, but we were just happy to be there to celebrate my birthday.  Will be back for sure!",3
Great spot! great view! great food!,4
"Need to update OpenTable directions. Reservations don‚Äôt work the same as a restaurant. You show up and you still have to wait in line. We waited in line for ~40 minutes, blowing through our ‚Äúgrace period‚Äù which was a little concerning. People behind us showed up early for their reservation and were seated before those with reservations closer to our time. Just delete the direction regarding the grace period and add directions on the fact that there is a line and regardless of your reservation time, you will be seated based on the line. People understand, but it caused a ton of lost time for the hostess to answer the questions from literally every single guest who showed up.",1
I know there are dealing with service restrictions but we got 2 burgers 1 lobster roll 1 fries and 3 drinks served and eaten on a paper box with plastic utensils and we payed $120,0
We had a reservation at 10PM we were brought right up no hassle or waiting. We had a beautiful table on the rooftop by the railing overlooking Boston! The service was amazing and the drinks delicious! Highly recommend,4
"Great views of the city. Great music. After 10pm there was only 3 options for food. Truffle fries, avocado with tostones, and a burger. Would be nice for some dessert or other food options. Great drinks! Fun time",4
Great job at implementing COVID-19 safety precautions! The space was not crowded but still felt lively. Of course the views at night are great. Definitely was able to enjoy a night out safely.,3
"The Rooftop is overall a nice place to go for a time out. During the Covid Pandemic, the Rooftop is taking the necessary steps to keep their customers safe.",3
View is what is worth coming up here for.,2
Small selection for food. Excellent drink menu. The view was incredible. Enjoyable day.,3
"Nice spot! Beautiful rooftop views, good drinks, yummy food, service was great! My only issue was a few patrons not abiding my the ‚Äúmask on when not at the table‚Äù rule, but overall, a good experience.",4
"The view and music are great. The food due to covid was served in boxes which was a big turn off itself. I got a burger and it was one of the worst burgers I‚Äôve ever had. The terrace though is worth it to come through for a drink and maybe share an app, but I came in for a brunch experience and it wasn‚Äôt very enjoyable since the non-alcoholic drink selection was very limited (they didn‚Äôt even have coffee, had to go with iced tea) and the food wasn‚Äôt good. Will come in another time just for some drinks since I love the view and ambiance",2
A waitress made a rude comment to my boyfriend. Otherwise great time.,3
"This place is fantastic! Spacious, great views, food and drinks! The social distancing was perfect and safe! Staff were all wonderful! Will definitely return!",4
"No value for money at all! 
The Garden Salad just had leaves and some mayonnaise! For $16!!! Terrible! I'd go back only for the view n nothing else!",1
"Everyone was very polite, they made sure they had masks. People were spaced out and the food was delicious. The drinks are absolutely amazing.",4
"The ambience, food and service was all excellent. I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone. Views of Boston Harbor and Skyline would be hard to beat",4
Perfect place for drinks and to be with friends. I will definitely come back.,4
It would be great to be able to stay more than 1h30,3
"Awful food. Good cocktails, great service and view. Prices way too high for food quality.",1
The rooftop is arguably even more amazing now that there is reserved seating. Service and view was impeccable. Drinks were fantastic.,4
"Location and view is great. Getting there before sunset was hot. Our waitress was super nice and helpful. Mediocre food served in a take-out box is not my thing. Drinks served in plastic cups works for beer, but nothing else. Mojito was pretty bad. No bottled sparkling water. Noise (which they may call music) was deafening and made conversations pretty much impossible. -- So it is a perfectly fine place to have a beer with a friend and a nice view. Just make sure that you bring a noise cancellation headset and communicate by text only.",1
"My ONLY problem with this place was the price of food/drinks. I didn't believe the food and drinks served were worthy of the price given what was on the menu and the size of the drinks. Besides that however, this place was wonderful. Beautiful setting, great service, nice music selections.....absolutely recommend people to give this place a try. You'd enjoy.",3
Went for drinks with friends. No wait or hassle using the reservation system. View is fantastic. Drinks are good. Staff is friendly and prompt.,4
"One of the coolest places in Boston to go with your partner and have a good time with friends. Amazing view from the rooftop, cool music, and excellent service.  I definitely recommend this bar.",4
"I enjoyed my experience at outlook. It was at the begging of being free after the lock down, the food was still in take out containers, and we still had to social distance. 

The location was great.",3
"Great view, friendly staff, excellent food, cocktails & wine.",4
Enjoyed the view and fresh air dining. A nice mixed group of families and young adults as well as older folks. Will go back soon.,4
"My 11 year old had said he wanted to watch the sun set during dinner for his birthday so we chose the Lookout Rooftop. As it happens, it faces slightly the wrong way, but the sky was beautiful as was the view. We were so thrilled to be outside with perfect weather in the fresh ocean air.  The staff were great - very careful and respectful. We ordered a bottle of wine, but the somm brought up the wrong (better) one and only charged for the wine we asked for. It was a 2015 Barbaresco from Fontanafreddi. Gorgeous. The food is relatively casual but it was all really tasty and satisfying. Overall, we had a really wonderful experience.",4
is a good time is there,3
Such a lovely view for dining outside. I highly recommend it!,4
"Good for drinks but not food, the food was mediocre",2
"The environment felt very safe with everything going on with COVID19. Food was good, even out of a box! Can‚Äôt beat that view!",4
We went here for our anniversary on the 4th. The staff couldn‚Äôt have been nicer! The view is gorgeous and the cocktails are great! The food is awesome but limited and very casual due to corona! We will go back soon!,4
Had a great night! Service was great and did a good job with social distancing.,4
Well i love this place..drinks where some good some not that good..one off them was like not good at all was sangria..really it was like water .no color no taste .no nothing worse sangria EVA!...the other drink where ok..love the view from this place ..we didn't try any food but we had food for ok m the restaurant downstairs many time food is ok ..looks fancy but nothing special REALLY. Over priced,4
What an incredible view. Food and service outstanding. Strongly recommend.,4
"Always great to enjoy time here. No line, no waiting is unheard of but grateful. A great time in all seasons. Did an excellent job of cleaning during a pandemic. Thank You.",4
"The rooftop has an extremely limited menu with almost no healthy options. The food we did have was good, but our server thought we were only there for drinks and left us alone for about 20 minutes without checking in. The cocktails are $16 and a simple Titos soda was $12 which is pretty high. The ambiance is beautiful and fun but definitely don‚Äôt go for food. It‚Äôs a drinks only atmosphere.",1
"Beautiful day, beautiful viewüòé",4
Great views of the waterfront. Very good lobster roll and tocates and guacamole app was delicious!  Very good service and a nice cold Sam Summer topped it off.,4
"I had my birthday party here last year and it‚Äôs so great. Last night I was there for a date and it‚Äôs perfect first date spot. Drinks are a little pricey, but that‚Äôs to be expected. Best view in Boston.",4
"Great food and view. Not sure if it was because they just reopened, but the waitstaff didn‚Äôt seem to know who was in charge of our table and we got neglected for most of the night.",2
I loved the place ! Amazing! The food I didn‚Äôt like but the drinks are awesome,2
"First time visiting Lookout Rooftop - was super excited. Made reservations for 2 at 10:30PM on July 2nd.  Arrived at 10:25PM, waited in line for over an hour - just for them to tell us they're at capacity and won't be letting anyone in for the rest of the night. What a great first impression. /s",0
After standing in line for 40 minutes we were told they are not allowing any more people upstairs despite there being around 30-40 people waiting with reservations.,0
Amazing view! Fantastic location.,4
I love the place the view is amazing and the food was delicious,4
"overall its okay, good rooftop, nice music, great service, food not so good and overpriced, you basically pay for the view which is nice but Ive seen better for same or lower price.",2
Made a reservation still didn‚Äôt help had to wait in an extra long line . People would come walk up and know the people working there and were able to go in before others. The service was trash but the server was very nice he just had too many tables to handle. The view is the only thing that saves this place. If you‚Äôre looking for a nice view and place for drinks since the food wasn‚Äôt that good and limited options then this is a good place.,1
"I love this place! They have changed the whole thing after covid as of seating and space and I love it! The only thing is the music was so loud that my friends and I had to yell to hear each other, otherwise the experience was perfect! I would definitely come here all the time.",4
"Service, seating, table quality and quantity were inadequate and of poor quality  There isn‚Äôt any way one could have a satisfactory experience given where we were sat and the table offered to us. Even after a requested move to a different table and seat assignment, we were still not able to have a comfortable or enjoyable experience so we walked out. Very unhappy with our experience at this restaurant and our hotel stay overall. Leaving a separate review on our hotel stay as well...",0
"Great drinks, great food, and attentive service (they even made sure we were in the shade on a hot day). The view is beautiful and it has a great vibe. Service is quick and attentive. The music was VERY loud and we could barely hear each other talk, though, which was a major downside",4
Great spot. Perfect view,4
Food was below average and drinks were ok but the view was great and the crowd was good.,2
Out with some coworkers and had a great time at the Rooftop. Our waitress was great. The drinks were superb. Just wish the menu was a little larger but I understand with the pandemic they are keeping things simple.  The view itself was to die for.,4
"Incredible view, service and food. It was a beautiful day and you can see for miles. They follow great social distancing program as well. Josh, the GM, made us feel like family the entire stay. I strongly recommend. The burger is outstanding and the egg sandwich simply outrageous.",4
Horrible service didn‚Äôt refill water or pay any interest to me and my girlfriend. Paid more attention to people who were drinking instead of dining in. Would not recommend!,1
"Have been here twice for brunch and loved it. Food is great, most recently had the Southwest omelette, prepared exactly as requested. My friend had the sweet potato hash and loved it. It was her bday so they added a nice ice cream dessert and a candle at the end. Best part is the service, they are laid back yet attentive, they don't rush you at all. Will be back for sure",4
"We celebrated our anniversary at the Outlook. It was an outstanding experience. The restaurant gave us each a complimentary glass of champagne to start. All of the staff was friendly, courteous, and went out of their way to make sure everything was fine. We had the scallops and the monkfish. Both were exceptional with great accompaniments. We will be back.",4
"Great food, ambiance and service.",4
Our dinner was fabulous! The wedge salad was amazing. Ambiance was nice. It was easy to park near the restaurant.,4
"The staff is great, service was great. The appetizers was Delicious!!!  We were So close to other customers. But a fillet mignon for $45 that is smaller than my fist is insane. I don‚Äôt mind paying  A million dollars for food but make it worth it please.  It was like buying a Toyota Camry for the price of a BMW.",1
"Valentine‚Äôs Day surprise, great food, good service, amazing views. Ate dinner on the first floor; standard pricing for the area. Then went up to the rooftop bar for a couple of drinks in the heated igloos (must try experience!).",3
Very noce waitress... excelent food and quick service,4
Quick service for a nice sit-down lunch. Staff was friendly and attentive.,4
We had a really nice breakfast and enjoyed the Lobster Benedict.  I'm gluten free so the restaurant was accommodating to give me gluten free bread and a side of fruit.  Quite healthy and a generous amount of lobster.  I enjoyed the French Press coffee at the table.  They have a more interesting breakfast menu than lots of places.,3
"My only experience is with breakfast.  I ordered the southwest omelette with potatoes.  The omelette had all of the ingredients noted on the menu, which is as it should be, however, nothing was seasoned.  The potatoes were not much better--definitely not worth the carbs.  My take on the breakfast...edible but uninspired.",2
"Good, food was great, service on point, very quiet and discrete.",4
Only recommend for the view at the lookout bar (if you ride the elevator up yo visit after your meal). The sweet potato hash was not hash at all. It was soft diced sweet potatoes with other soft veggies. No crunch or fried bits at all. Was definitely a disappointment as our waiter described it as his most highly recommended food item on the menu. The brunch cocktails were delicious though.,3
Went here for Brunch on Sunday. Food was very good and for Boston the price was not bad. Drinks were good and beer selection extensive for a hotel restaurant. Service a little slow but we weren‚Äôt in a rush so that was not a problem. Will go back again.,3
"The lamb chops were delicious as well as the beet appetizer. The Carbonara was pretty bland. Weak service, beer served without a glass. Overall: not worth a $170 bill for 2.",3
Our waiter Michael was outstanding. Good food. Small portions. Left hungry. The food was creative and flavorful but they served it on over sized plates and it was small in size.  If the service wasn‚Äôt so good I probably wouldn‚Äôt go back.,3
The Outlook never disappoints. My family and I have held quite a few birthday celebrations at The outlook and entertained out of town guests there as well. The food is spectacular and the ambiance is gorgeous. I will continue to choose The Outlook whenever I am planning a special time out.,4
Great food and service!,4
"The food was amazing!! However I wish they announced that selections are limited on new year‚Äôs eve. They had a Dj that night, the noise level was unbelievable. I had to scream to get heard by the person sitting across the table from me.  Not what i had aimed for. Not what i experienced in my last visit. I wanted a classy resturant to celebrate new year‚Äôs eve in and that‚Äôs not what i got..",0
"The restaurant was very good, the service was great, and the food was fantastic.  However, the New Years Eve DJ left something to be desired.",3
"When we made the reservation, we were not notified that there would *only* be a price fixe menu at $99/pp. While the meal was fine enough, a $235 tab for a basic three-course meal (risotto entree, steak entree) at a high-top in a bar was wildly overpriced. Very disappointing.",2
"A great Restaurant and team!! Food was delicious , service great and atmosphere very nice! We recommend it wholeheartedly!",4
Brunch.  Great food and drinks.  Love it for brunch,4
The first waiter was very good‚Äî‚Äî-he left before we finished our meal. The second waiter just completely ignored us..,4
"Lovely restaurant, the ambience is lovely, food was excellent - my husband had the gnocchi and loved it! I had the scallops- rather good too- could use a little more carb to be more filling! I think it should have more people writing dinner reviews... we thought its mainly brunch when we got there. No, its pretty good for dinner too! I would go back again, and lets hope more people do to give it the vibe it deserves!",3
The food was great. The cocktails weren‚Äôt our favorites. We had to send back two of them. But the service was great other than waiting on the check for a while. We had to take the bill to the server to pay it. Everything else was great!,3
"We had a fantastic brunch at Outlook Kitchen! The food was delicious, service was impeccable, and we were able to have a good business conversation in a nice, sedate ambience.",4
It was our first time and we all decided that we want to go back soon.,4
"Why give such stingy portions on Thanksgiving? Everything tasted okay, but I was disappointed that the portions were so small. The staff didn't seem very happy.  Overall, not a welcoming feeling.",2
"Food was delicious, but we found the portions to be a bit small for the price. The restaurant is located in a convenient area at the front of the Seaport District and you have to visit their roof top bar and lounge called The Lookout. Very nice layout with seating available inside and outside that includes amazing views of Boston.",2
Everything was great except the menu was different online than when I showed up so that was a little disappointing,2
We paid $40 for the Scallops and they only served 5 on a plate. Pretty disappointing.,1
"Sooooo delicious 
The service was fantastic 
It was a bit loud - but worth it!!!",4
No variety in the food menu,2
Drinks and appetizers were great. The rest of the menu was so so.,3
This place had amazing service and great food! Perfect spot to celebrate a birthday!,4
Amazing experience. Fantastic service. Lovely ambience. Good menu with great food. Very talented chef.,4
The kitchen has really got it together.  I was rather unimpressed the first couple of times I went after they first opened but it has gotten consistently better.  My wife and I had a fantastic dinner and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend enjoying a meal there.  The service also should be called out as the servers were all very attentive making it a great experience all the way around.,4
Just ok. Service was horrible. Food was ok. Overpriced.,2
Service was not good. Food was good.,2
"We needed to dine close to the Rockland Trust Pavilion and this was convenient. Food was good, ambience not really our thing but for a warm September evening it was perfect!

I would go back if we go to another concert at The pavilion.",3
"We have been to this restaurant many times.  Best time to visit is during brunch on weekends.  You will receive attentive, professional service and it's quiet.  They made me a lobster roll even though it was not on the menu.  Breakfast was enjoyed by the remainder of our party.  Large portions.  Great price point for the city.  Marriott Rewards points earned and we were able to get into the rooftop bar without a wait.  It was busy because it was a nice day, but not overcrowded.  All in all a great time. We'll be back.",4
Birthday was acknowledged in a delightful way,4
Great location and excellent for business or casual dining.,4
"Interesting spot as its in a hotel lobby, but definitely a modern interior. Nice view of city, great outdoor seating options when it is nice. 
Had the lobster roll, it was quite good. Service was very good. Enjoyable Exp.",2
"not a broad enough entree menu, we ended up sharing appetizers instead. Pricey but the food was very good.",3
Chef Tatiana was awesome. Food was amazing. Mr Foley was an excellent server.,4
Great food and setting,4
"Outside patio felt like picnic tables, inside was nice ambience but service was poor and wasnt even that busy. Menu Sucked! Awful selections that dont even make sense for a place like that. Are u fine dining , a bar or casual???? Waste",0
"Drinks, food, service was excellent - would definitely recommend!",4
Exceptional,4
Chef Tatianna does it again! Came here with friends and the food was absolutely perfect. Ordered some apps including the tuna tartar tostada and they hit the spot. Also had a bay scallop meal and it was incredible.  Whatever they used as the sauce on it was so flavorful and almost dessert like. Not sure I‚Äôve had something like it before. The scallops were so fresh and the presentation was 5 star.  Love this place and hope to visit again.,4
Wonderful service from staff members and a great ambience. The food was a bit pricey for the portion sizes and overall selection. The ‚ÄúRooftop‚Äù advertising is a bit misleading as the restaurant is on ground level and no reservations can be made to actually eat on the rooftop. There is only a bar located on the rooftop and it is first come first serve to get in even if you made reservations for dinner on the ground floor. I would recommend skipping the food and going straight up to the bar for a drink and a beautiful view of the Boston skyline. The view is worth the trip.,2
It was a pleasant lunch - enjoyed being able to sit outside.,4
"Super nice waiter Abdel.  Very kind to our son, who has special needs.  Great ambiance outside on a beautiful Boston night.  Pleasant live music wafting from restaurant across the way.  Imaginative menu.  Good choice for pescatarians!",4
Definitely a nice brunch atmosphere. Loved the restaurant set-up and the cuisine.,3
Loved our server! Nice location and good food. Great place for brunch.,3
"My girl friends and I had a great experience at Outlook Kitchen. The staff was really nice, and our server was outstanding. We were seated in a beautiful private glass room. Food was delicious also, good sizes and prices weren‚Äôt too bad. Overall a wonderful experience at Outlook Kitchen.",4
"For the size of the entry and quality of the food, the price was too high.  I would not recommend this restaurant for dinner; it is a good place for cocktails & appetizers only.",2
"The food was fantastic and not too heavy (in part due to the portion sizes being on the small size. Servers were attentive and fast despite it being busy. We had booked a reservation for an outdoor table and were seated at a high top, but all in all it was a very positive experience.",3
The scallops were incredible!,4
Great breakfast select and attentive service.,4
"The portion was decently small for the price. The steak was also overcooked, and there were a variety of nuts in the salad which were neither described in the menu, not mentioned by the waitress. Overall, the meal still tasted good.",2
"The menu had a good variety. Food taste was excellent. Wait time was not too long, before being seated. We were hoping to get direct access to the rooftop after dinner which they said we couldn't. Disappointed for sure, having spent over $150 for a fine meal/drinks to not have access to the rooftop but to step out and wait in line again. They should have a min. bill threshold to let people dining have direct access to the rooftop if they don't want everyone abusing this easy access. At least make some positive changes in this regard.",4
"Everything from the dinner to the rooftop to the waitstaff was top notch! We were greeted by the host, Leo, who was exceptional! The chef stopped by our table, which I loved since I am a true foodie! Food was amazing! The views on the rooftop were spectacular! We had a wonderful evening and can‚Äôt wait to return!",4
"The staff did no receive my reservation, which luckily they weren‚Äôt busy but they seemed annoyed at that I claimed to have a reservation but didn‚Äôt show in the system. We weren‚Äôt asked if we preferred to sit inside or outside and they sat us close to another table when the place was practically empty. Our waters were never refilled and the drink menu was taken away prior to us staying we were finished. The waitress was busy chatting with other staff and didn‚Äôt check on us; I could see if it was busy... but it wasn‚Äôt. Also, we were celebrating a birthday over brunch and the overall experience was okay. The food however was phenomenal.",2
I made a lunch reservation for the restaurant at the top of the hotel but they confirmed for street level. This was a goodbye lunch for an associate who was returning to her home in China. So we wanted the city view for her. We got the Crab Shack. The hotel did not make it clear that they‚Äôd switched the reservation. They could have bee more explicit when they originally confirmed and explained that the rooftop location wasn‚Äôt open at lunch. Their marketing seemed to imply it was. Otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have booked it.,2
"Good food, nice setting.  Service was not warm, welcoming or friendly.",3
"Very pricey, food was underwhelming for the the price. The rooftop bar is the main attraction, so stick with that. Either way your going to pay a lot.",3
The food wasn‚Äôt good and fresh at all. We ordered 3 dishes from the appetizer menu and were very disappointed. Our waiter were never around and we had to keep asking for things from different waiters/waitresses. The receptionists weren‚Äôt welcomed and rude. We won‚Äôt go back there again!,0
Celebrated my aunts birthday and everything was perfect. Annie was our waitress and she was remarkable! Definitely a great asset to the team.,4
"The service was very bad, waitress took our order and we never saw her again. I should say we saw her, just not at our table.",2
"The worst service we received. First off we didn‚Äôt get any service for the first 10 min. Then when the waiter took our order, we ordered our meals and coffee. We got our food way before our coffee and had to remind them about the coffee multiple times for them to then go and just grab a thermos of coffee right next to us. Overall the service was extremely poor which is unfortunate because the location is great.",0
"Food was excellent -- the breakfast hash was exceptional with tons of really fresh veggies. The ambiance was great with patios outside and basically shielded from any road noise which is rare in Boston. The service on the other hand was really bad (took ~20 minutes to be greeted after seating, server forgot my OJ, received meal covered in sour cream after asking for none, server's attitude was careless). In Boston, there's enough restaurants that you really can demand great food AND great ambiance AND great service.",2
Tehrw was no arrangement for birthday celebration even when I wrote special note plus there was outdoor seating option while reserving but when I went there they mentioned it‚Äôs a mistake we don‚Äôt take reservation for the same very unpleasant experience. Food quality was bad too server didn‚Äôt give silver wares and drinks option properly.,0
Our lamb was slightly undercooked and it was minimal. It was a 38$ meal but we left hungry. Additionally someone else got tacos which had no flavor and were dry.  The host was very helpful and friendly. The server was patient when we didn‚Äôt know what to order. But the food was subpar and we would not come back for that.,1
The steak was outstanding,4
Service great and so was food. Raining so could not sit outside but looked very nice,4
"We were out to celebrate our daughter being home from NYC. It was my second visit to the Outlook Kitchen (had been there for a yummy lunch) and my family's first visit for dinner. 
It is a restaurant and bar with a high energy and the feel of ""the place to be in Boston"". It is casual and on trend with the scene at the Seaport. If you are looking for quiet, white cloth restaurant with simple or traditional menu items...this is not for you. Perhaps you should select another spot if Granny is with you unless she is fun and trendy.The setting is really open, loud and electric and when we got there for a 7:30 reservation the bar and outside area were jammed. Even with the big crowd, the restaurant honored our open table reservation by seating us immediately. 
We are foodies and appreciate inventive menus and creative food presentation. Outlook's menu was perfect for us. We had a hard time deciding what to order because there were so many great choices. We tasted the Blue Hills mussels, tuna tartare on a tostada and watermelon & burrata. All were delicious. Perhaps the best mussels we have ever tasted ....our plates looked like they were licked clean. The meal was off to a great beginning. I can't wait to channel Chef Tatiana and service my version of the watermelon burrata dish this summer since it was so refreshing and presented beautifully . 
For entree's we had the chicken, george's bank scallops and red snapper in a banana leaf and the yuca gnocchi with a side of shishito peppers( which comes life at the table). I wish I could remember the exact description of each item how ever they were amazing. Any one of these dishes would be reason enough to run back to Outlook. The gnocchi was so flavorful and delicious. I am not typically a gnocchi fan, however I would order this dish in a heartbeat. The scallops were sweet and fresh on a bed of pea and something puree. The Snapper had soft and crunchy flavors and palate teasers and the chicken was tender and flavorful.",4
"We were referred to this restaurant by our hotel concierge, for the view and the jazz brunch on Sunday. As a result, we were able to make a reservation for outdoor seating. We were seated right away, but were disappointed in that there was no view (I think the concierge was confused with the rooftop bar), but even more disappointing was that there was competing music from The Barking Crab that was across the alley. While the music from each place was fine in its own merit, the combination of the two was a big noisy mess. Upon talking with the hostess, it was revealed that it happens every Sunday. While the Seaport area is lovely, given the location of the restaurant patio, it could be confused with any other noisy restaurant corner in Boston. Disappointing.",2
"Very young crowd, so noisy.  Hard to hear each other.  Food and service were good, just not the place for  50 something group.",3
We had a horrible server. Long waits to order drinks and food. Didn‚Äôt check on us at all.,1
"I took my cousin who was visiting from New York City and she found it very similar to restaurants in the city. We went for dinner in early June. Both of our meals were great- the grilled chicken is consistently excellent. The drinks and food are highly overpriced, but it‚Äôs all about the ambiance. It was my second time dining there and I‚Äôll return many more times.",3
"Food is just not that good, and priced at a premium. Will go elsewhere for future dinners, and Envoy only for drinks.",2
"Laid back service, reservations not very clear that it‚Äôs not for roof deck. Overall good food and good environment.",4
"Too many good restaurants in the area to try this one again. Been three times and  disappointed every time. I so badly wanted to like this place as I live next-door, no luck...",1
"French toast was amazing! 
A good spot for Sunday brunch.",3
Annie was great-very attentive. Food was delicious,4
"Food was amazing.
No brunch cocktails before 9:30am",4
Great food and enjoyed the visit except we were from out of town and confused about outlook vs lookout.  Booked hoping to be outside to have drinks and apps.,4
"Overall food was OK. Charging way too much got the value proposition. New trendy hotel, but that‚Äôs the only thing this place has going for it.",0
"Service was a little slow despite the restaurant not being that busy.  I ordered eggs over easy, but got scrambled instead (I didn't complain because I was fine eating the scrambled).",2
We went here for Mother's Day and were not disappointed.  The food and service were excellent.,3
"Food was ""good"" and the service was ""good"".  Nothing about it was great.  We had brunch on Sunday and between the singer with the ear-splitting voice and the TV's with the Jerry Springer infomercial on the ambience was horrendous.  All while the Red Sox were playing as well as a golf tournament.  Despite asking twice for the Red Sox game we were forced to watch Jerry...",2
We had breakfast at the Outlook Kitchen. The menu has some unique selections. Service was very good.,4
"Had an outstanding experience at Outlook! Enjoyed several appetizers, mussels, ceviche, then the amazingly delicious steak! Would be more than happy to point people in the direction of this place when looking for an impressive experience and courteous yet respectful service. 5 stars for sure!",4
Amazing service and staff! Came here for graduation celebration and it was beyond my expectations. The staff was so accommodating and thoughtful with the celebration! Would absolutely come back again for another celebratory meal.,4
Annie was excellent!  Kelly Gift was easy to book the event through.,4
"Great location overlooks Ft Pt Channel we easy access from South Station.  Scallops were outstanding.  Room was a bit noisy with a company bonding event taking place, but otherwise top shelf.",3
Michael was our server and made the dining experience awesome.,4
"Food was alright, would be better in warmer weather. Good drinks and atmosphere",2
"Live Jazz music during brunch. This was my second time here.Brunch menu is well rounded and classic. Food was very good, two of us had omelets and other two had shakshouka (I have menu envy)! Price was reasonable for an upscale hotel restaurant. Great location, bright and modern decor, not overly crowded and the music was a nice touch.",3
"I dined here on a Saturday night with a group of friends. We were seated past our reservation time, but it was not the restaruants fault as it was a nice night and people wanted to sit and enjoy the open windows. My only true complaints are the service was extremely slow. It took forever to receive waters, let alone our alcoholic drinks. Almost 15-20 minutes. We shared three appetizers; the grilled octopus, steak tartare, and tuna tataki. Each was prepared beautifully, except the portions were not exactly generous for the price (between $15-18).  For dinner, we had the filet, steak frites, salmon, and paella. The paella was a very small portion but delicious. All the other entrees were good size. The ambiance is not exactly romantic or a place you'd like to stay and hang out. Between the food and the service, the experience was average. I most likely will not be back due to there are better restaurants in the vicinity for the price and better ambiance and service.",2
"Food wasn‚Äôt good. Not worth the price. Lobster Benedict was overpriced and they don‚Äôt even use real lobster. Regular eggs Benedict was lackluster and the ham on it just looked like one slice of deli meat. Hash browns and drinks were good, service was okay. Inside of the restaurant is pretty, nice atmosphere.",2
Food too salty. Salmon not cooked at all.,0
"I visit Envoy often but this time the service was pretty bad, the waiter didn't seem to pleased to have his job. It took multiple times to get the attention and requests for common things such as silverware, water etc. My party also got the sense that the waiter wanted us out quickly, he attempted to deliver the receipt before we even made out dessert request. The food and ambiance was decent and that's probably the reason I'll come back again. Highly recommend to order multiple starters and treat it as a sharing style meal.",1
Great service and delicious food! Also love the atmosphere.,4
Both food and service was very good. The live entertainment was way too loud for brunch.,2
The Salmon was spectacular. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. My wife had the Risotto and said it was the best she had ever had. We will definitely be back.,3
Good is just not that great!,2
"Nice place, if not a little pricey. The hotel feels a little bougey but a nice dinner",3
"We had a great experience, everything was perfect. We‚Äôll be returning again soon.",4
"Loved having friend time with my Bestie Kelly!! We enjoyed the igloos as much as going to have dinner, not being in the restaurant part of the envoy it was amazing the Decor To food did the job it was so worth it!!",4
Very first time at Outlook for a special occasion. Aubrie was very knowledgeable and charming. Maintained excellent service standard throughout our time at the table. French Toast and Pancakes were excellent choice to start off with. Thoroughly enjoyed it and definitely will go back.,4
"The food was delicious. Executive chef Tatian Rodman‚Äôs is very humble. She came and met my group. She didn‚Äôt get weirder out that I found her on LinkedIn LOL. 

My group sat in a glass room that overlooked the kitchen. We could see everything going on. 

The waiter was very attentive and met our needs.",4
"Came in for Sunday Brunch. There was live music, the decor is inviting with edision lights and an open dining area. The lobster benedict is one of the best, if not the best I've had in the NE area. There was a generous amount of lobster on both halves, the egg was poached were the yolk was still soft- overall delicious! The sandwich was alright in comparison but there seemed to be too much mayo.  The coffee was good but there were no refills, or we weren't offered a refill which was upsetting as the mugs were deceivingly small.",4
Everything was great!,4
A great afternoon for a delicious brunch with friends. Service was great. Always enjoy the Envoy!,4
the waiter the worst. His attention was rude and unfriendly little information for the menu. your attention is for a MC Donalds .. perfect for that place .,3
"Really good food. The risotto and Mac n Cheese are amazing. Also, the salmon is really good. We were a group of six and shared the flatbread as an appetizer; it was excellent and enough as a starter! 
Really good ambiance, we went for a birthday celebration and it was a great place for it!",4
"The food includes a wide variety of dishes, all well prepared and the service and ambiance is wonderful.",3
Great service and delicious food.,4
"The Pancakes are really good! We had the Chilequilles with checken and that had too many nanchos and not enough meat. 
Also the mimosas were not the best, except for the Basil one. 
Will get take out from there in the future for some of the sweeter stuff but that's about it.",2
"Been here multiple times, cannot get enough of the delicious food. Extremely recommend it!",4
"The lobster Benedict is one of the best Benedict‚Äôs  I‚Äôve ever had! Wow, what a great place for brunch.",4
Not impressed with service or cocktails. Expected more considering the hype about this location.,2
I requested for a regular table and the hostess still asked us if it was OK to get a high table. She was very grouchy and not friendly at all. And when we got situated in our table we waited for more than 10 minutes to have a waiter come to us. I even had to ask for one. Otherwise we could have waited longer for the waiter to come. Not a good experience for us,2
To be honest I‚Äôve been out a lot lately and am catching up on reviews. The fact I can‚Äôt recall with any great fondness the meal I enjoyed here speaks for itself I suppose. I keep coming back but I‚Äôm not sure why. I always leave feeling like I want it to be nicer than they do. Great hotel. The food is serviceable but the whole thing lacks soul.,2
"Had a dinner with my friend, we loved the food and the vibe of the place, but the restaurant was freezing (we had to ask to have the heat turned on?) and our waiter was honestly terrible. He would barely wait for us to finish our sentences before walking away, he never asked us if we wanted another drink after our first one (we did), and when we ordered dessert and coffee the dessert came out right away but the coffees were MIA until we asked about them, and when we did he acted like we were bugging him and was like ‚Äúyeah yeah yeah they are coming‚Äù. Overall I would go back for the food but maybe in the summer and definitely not with that waiter.",2
"The waitress was. A little spacey, but otherwise, great food! I‚Äôd go back for sure",3
My fav mushroom risotto in Boston,3
Best breakfast I had in Boston was at the Envoy! They have great coffee and home fries too! Love the decore as well,4
"Nice atmosphere, spacious, easy to access for those coming into the South end from I-93. No rush, very good food, great place to hang with friends.",4
"The Outlook is a WONDERFUL addition to the Seaport District!!!  The dishes created by Chefs Tatiana and Sam are original, unique and yet comprised of simple ingredients.  The staff is friendly and available but does not rush anyone.  The rooftop offers a breathtaking view of the Boston skyline.

Each time I visit I find new menu items and I am amazed that, as busy as the restaurant is, the crefs make time to personally greet me.  

Chefs Tatiana and Sam are amazing and CANNOT be replaced!!",4
Food was great.  The service was a little slow for lunch time.  If we were going for dinner it would have been perfect.  Our server was pleasant and knowledgeable.,3
"Chef Tatiana is incredibly talented. The food, drinks and service were top notch. Pleasant atmosphere.",4
"Main courses were delicious! Gorgeous place. Live music, fantastic!",3
"It was my friends birthday and she came into the city to have a fun dinner! We absolutely LOVED the food, but the service was relatively poor. We felt a bit neglected, especially for a Saturday night. Would still go back for another chance, it was delicious.",3
Great food!,4
"Food was very good, but portions were small for the price (Octopus appetizer has only one leg).  Kitchen was tied up serving ""large"" party according to manager, no offer to compensate for extensive wait time while we were seated, other than to offer to let us leave before we were served our entrees...",1
"This restaurant is amazing. The food and drinks were outstanding. We got the Finish Line and Strawberry mimosas which were delicious. We had the brunch menu and ordered the chilaquiles and the lobster benedict, both were nothing but perfection. Definitely coming back and extremely recommend it.",4
Best chef ever! Great food and service. Highly recommended.,4
This was one of the most creative menus I have seen in recent memory. Food was amazing. Flavors and textures were perfect. Best place in boston for sure.,4
The service was adequate but not outstanding. The food was excellent and the location great. I'd recommend without hesitation.,3
We had an amazing dining experience at the Outlook Kitchen. The food and service were both superlative. We would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a special evening out in downtown Boston.,4
"Outlook is always amazing. Chef Tatiana is one of the most creative chefs in Boston. Whether you are in the mood for a burger at the bar or more adventurous cuisine, you won‚Äôt be disappointed!",4
"I really enjoy the space at the outlook. Has huge windows for people watching and soaking in the atmosphere. We had a nice brunch for 6, food was good but best part was a really nice private table that was beautiful and interesting.",4
Chef Tatiana keeps the menu interesting and delicious,4
"While the scene is vibrant it seems the kitchen cannot handle a crowded Saturday night! The waiter was very knowledgeable and good, but food took about an hour to get to us, then the NY Strip was hard and scallops cold and rubbery!! A little disappointed based on reviews, but plan to give them a second try next time in town!!",1
I didn‚Äôt like that they didn‚Äôt record my open table reservation. They just need to be a little more attentive. They haves a great table and the place was great though.,2
"Thyme cocktail was basically lemonade with a sprig of thyme. Not well balanced, just sweet.  Octopus appetizer was fishy. Duck fritters were almost entirely bread with no duck substance detectable. The scallop entree was 4 scallops on a large plate. Ordered the steak frites medium rare, but came well done. The look of the place is great, but everything else was lacking.",2
The Octopus appetizer was amazing as well as the Poke.  The Bay of Funday Salmon was the best salmon I have ever had.  Excellent food and service,4
"I think we came on an off morning but we had a terrible experience at Sunday brunch. They told us the bartender didn't show up that morning, so they could not serve alcohol. The service was very slow.",0
Food and service was great but live music was way too loud for breakfast,4
Food was amazing and the service was quick and nice. We loved the ambience and lounge seating,4
"We had a good time with delicious food and great service. The crowd, in addition to the open space, does make it a little more noisy than a regular restaurant (similar to a bar‚Äôs noise level), so plz be alert if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for. The rooftop has fantastic view, and wasn‚Äôt that crowded on the weekdays so we were lucky. It‚Äôs overall a good experience.",4
"We had the best dinner here that we have had so far in Boston. The food was outstanding. We started with a sausage and fennel
flatbread and blue fin tuna which were delicious. Our entrees included salmon, scallops, strip steak and lobster mac and cheese. I have to say we all loved our meals. Each dish was presented beautifully and full of flavor. The service was excellent. Thank you Tim for taking such good care of us. Such a great night. Will definitely be back soon.",4
"Love the food and the environment, will come again",4
I had a mimosa here and it was amazing. The service is a bit slow but the overall experience was great,3
The server was not welcoming which cut out meal short,3
"Nice service. Good food and ambience. Try the lobster Mac & cheese, it‚Äôs nice.",3
Went here for a family meet up brunch.  The food hit the spot and it was a nice place to eat.  I would be happy to go back and try it for dinner.,2
"They messed on up the same drink twice. The first time it was ordered and then the second time when we asked for another round.  It was a prosecco and instead we got a mimosa.  I understand once, but twice?",2
"Made us wait more than an hour after ordering. Food sucked. Rooftop might be worth it, but downstairs is just awful.",0
Very nice place with great atmosphere. The food was very good.,3
"Disappointed with service and execution! When we arrived our waiter looked less enthusiastic to serve us. He brought water in plastic cups. I looked around and noticed tables around us had a mix of plastic cups and glasses. That looked tacky to me so I asked for glasses. Food was OK, nothing spectacular about it. After dinner, I mentioned to the manager that it was my birthday and we  wanted to go to the Rooftop for drinks. He told us to go outside and get in line for that. I was surprised by the response, after spending a substantial amount of money on dinner you would assume it would be OK to go straight to the rooftop. We got in line, and was disappointed by what we saw. Apart from the views there‚Äôs nothing else  to it. Very limited seating and you could barely hear the music!",1
"Food was good but too pricy for the entire experience . Place was too loud, packed, service was poor and food took a while to be served. Overall, there are other places way much better for the same price.

My father was visiting and I spent some time trying to find sth different ... I failed",0
The food was very good and our server Michael was really wonderful. He was very attentive and friendly. It was a wonderful evening. The bar was a bit loud but it attracts a young hip crowd after work so  it‚Äôs undrstandable and we could speak and hear our fellow diners,3
"My husband and I went out here for drinks and dinner after work on a Tuesday, hoping to grab a drink at the rooftop bar before dinner at the Outlook Kitchen. There was a line to get up on to the rooftop at 5:45...and was still there when we left around 7:30...we never made it up since we didn't feel like waiting in line. Outlook Kitchen had a small menu, small portions and ok drinks. We were seated outside which was kind of loud next to the Barking Crab and no view to speak of. Waitstaff and host were nice enough. The bar inside Outlook Kitchen seemed cool - had a nice vibe.",1
"Server never looked us in the eye. There was no one there, yet somehow the hostess was too busy to greet us. The ice tea was terrible, starters and mains were delivered at the same time, I asked for the salad to be dressed, but lightly, but they brought the dressing on the side - not the same. It‚Äôs a shame, good ambience (even though it was empty at lunch time), but service was a disaster.",1
Service was slow and the food was extremely overpriced for the was It was prepared. Good for hotel guests but if you‚Äôre not saying there don‚Äôt go out of your way,2
"I got the Straight A Salad which was very good in taste, portion was a bit small. My friend got the Caesar salad which did not look like a Caesar salad at all, but it seemed fine. The drinks were weak for the amount of money they cost and honestly the little kid at the table next to me got a PB&J that looked better than my meal! It was fine for what it was but overpriced in my opinion.",2
"The food is innovative and most of it was really nice.  I was looking forward to my lamb belly, but had to return it.  The ratio was 2/3 fat and 1/3 meat.  The waiter double checked with the kitchen and I got told, that is how lamb belly is... Hmmm!?
Service was friendly, but not very professional.  Red wine glas was spilled with red wine when served.  We had to ask to clear the table after finishing.
The most annoying thing was the plastic cubs with water. When asking why there where no glasses, the answer was, that there are not enough glasses for in and outside, so they serve in plastic outside.  More than half of inside seating was empty though!",2
"Food was decent, service subpar",3
Forgot my toast with my breakfast. Didn‚Äôt get it until I was almost done. Mimosas are $14. Eggs were very overdone. I heard everyone else‚Äôs food was decent though. Maybe just don‚Äôt get the eggs.,2
Great outdoor patio. Food was solid but a little pricey.,2
Great service and great outdoor seating,4
"The food was very good. However, the service was very slow, the drinks were very weak and the food was way overpriced. I could have dined at Morton's for what I spent here. Definitely won't go back.",2
Really cool / chic interior - they were kind enough to seat us for brunch even though the kitchen had closed. Food was very good (not outstanding but very good) and the waterfront view was fun! Would definitely recommend.,3
"Great all around experience. Had four apps which were the lamb, poke, octopus, and frites. Each was well prepared and delicious. Upstairs on the roof was an excellent view as well as great drinks. Highly recommend.",3
"It's a good place but I went on the 4th of July for lunch and not much was happening, which is understandable. But the Tuna Poke was definitely tasting like old fish. I assume this must have been an exception given the holiday date.",3
Mark the manager was amazing and super accommodating!,4
Went for Sunday breakfast/brunch. Some unusual items on the menu. I tried the french toast with rum glazed bananas and was disappointed. Very light on the custard and only 4 small rounds of banana that were so unripe I wondered if they were plantains. The others ordered more traditional breakfast items which they were ok with.,1
"A little pricey for the drinks, but the food was delicious. Definitely a high-end bar scene in the heart of Seaport. After dinner we went upstairs to the rooftop and the views were amazing.",4
"Food was good enough but overpriced, small portions. Service was lacking. Water glasses say empty. Took forever to get a server to take a drink order.",1
"Great service, great atmosphere, great food",4
"The eggs Benedict was perfect, but the Sourdough toast was tough going- probably not made fresh. The eggs and sausage were also excellent but the croissants were not so good. They need to be made the French way. The waitress was good at taking the order and getting us set up but did not top up the coffee. Still enjoyed it",3
"We came in from Colorado to visit family. The food, drinks, DESSERTS, and service were amazing! We will definitely be back next time we‚Äôre in Boston!",4
Anniversary,4
"The host was incredibly rude. We arrived for our reservation, but decided not to stay. Would not recommend.",0
Wonderful food. Great spot. Friendly and attentive service.,4
"Other than the service (Kenny was amazing)
Average at best
Food was missing pops of flavor 
What you expect from hotel dining 
Outside seating is great 
But the walking traffic through patio is annoying",2
"the service  was great, the food was awesome. i recommended this place the other day to guests who were staying at the hotel that I work at and they loved it too!",4
"Terrible service, food so so. I expected better. Likely will not return.",2
"We really like this restaurant but Sunday brunch offers a better menu than Monday breakfast. Uncharacteristicly our server was not as good as usual, announcing he had a late night last night and little sleep: it showed.",3
"Came from out of state for a special occasion just to visit this restaurant because we had a great experience on a previous visit.  This time was a HUGE disappointment.  The food quality was not as good this time.  It was more of your run of the mill hotel restaurant experience this time.  The biggest disappointment was being told all of the deserts that our special occasion guest of honor wanted was reserved for another party and they could not spare even one.  We explained the special occasion and they were completely unaccommodating.  We asked to talk to the manager who was completely dismissive.  So don't both to make this a special occasion spot in the future as you will not be treated with respect and the quality of service you would expect commensurate with the cost of the bill.  With so many other options out there, we will not be back to this restaurant and the manager could care less.",0
"This is a place you go to sit at the bar and have small plates.  Our app was good, but our entree's were late and cold.  Steak was ordered med rare, but came out  rare (cold and raw in the middle) and pre cut....  who pre cuts steak?  

Server was MIA all night.

Go here for a drink and the view upstairs then go get something to eat somewhere else.",2
"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday. Food was excellent, service was great and the waiter was more than willing to help my boyfriend decide on the best wine to have with his steak. We sat at the edge of the dining area where it opens up into the patio so we had some AC and some of the heat so we were extremely comfortable. Love it, will definitely return for another special occasion.",4
"The food was incredible. We ordered the scallops and the steak frites, both were delicious and prepared as ordered. The service was incredibly slow - from the host stand to receiving the food. The experience took about 2 hours, which was longer than expected for 2 people. Our waiter, however, was incredibly accommodating.",3
"I wasn't impressed, the dishes were not over-the-top and they were rushing us with our orders. That is ok with a toddler, but for Mother's Day - it was interesting in how rushed we were.",1
"I brought my (very particular) Mom in for Mother's day for brunch SOLELY because they offered Lobster Eggs Benedict. We were blown away, we both loved it and my bloody mary was great as well...my boyfriend got some food too but I was too busy inhaling my meal. She was a bit sensitive of the volume from the live music, but I think this was just because not many people were in the restaurant. Our waitress was super sweet as well, she was so accommodating and patient with my mother after a few noise level complaints, while also REALLY knowledgable on the menu items and the chef, which was really cool to hear (we almost opted for dessert afterwards). We will definitely return.",4
Bad experience overall. Service mediocre. Food not better than a diner. Real disappointment,1
Excellent waiter!,4
"The description said energetic brunch with a DJ. However, the restaurant was not even half full. There was a girl playing the guitar and singing covers. It was nice, but not what I was expecting to bring my friends from out of town for a fun brunch experience. The food was good. The drinks were good, but they were out of the specialty mimosa I wanted. The lookout bar on the roof was the best part!",2
We went fo Sunday brunch. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the breakfast selections and quality of the food and service. The food was fabulous. I had an excellent eggs Benedict and my partner had a delicious shakshuka. Rachel was a excellent server and really made sure everything was attended to. We will definitely be back,4
"My mother was in town to catch a cruise ship to Bermuda. We met for breakfast and it was awesome. Great service, great food, and we had a good time!",4
"Service was awful. Sat down, waited 20 minutes before we were asked what we wanted to drink and wasn‚Äôt until we were there for over an hour that we got any food.",2
"The Seaport  District leaves a lot to be desired in terms of quality of food and service. Outlook did not alter my outlook on this.  Prices are unreasonable for the quality of service, drinks and food. Husband's NY STRIP was served as medallions with burnt perimeters on each piece,  tasting like burnt oil.  My fish was overcooked and dull.  Both dishes had Asian nuances of flavor that didn't work.  The fun began with the cold welcome and never made a turn around.  The really shocking part was the children's burger was served on crispy thick baguette that even an adult would find hard to chew.  A wasted evening and wasted money.",0
"Absolutely amazing food. Pricey, but worth it. The acoustic guitar player was a lovely touch.",4
"Brunch was terrific. The female singer was a wonderful addition to a great meal. Really trendy place with good food, service, and ambiance!",3
"The food was pretty good not outstanding but well priced. It‚Äôs conveniently located if you have plans in the Seaport later on. Nice location right on the Harborwalk. Mostly young professional crowd. You can grab a after dinner drink on the rooftop bar. Only gripe was that the service could have been a little quicker but the staff was friendly.
I‚Äôd totally go back again",3
Always amazing,4
"I actually can‚Äôt speak to the food- we didn‚Äôt get any.  We were greeted promptly at the door and seated promptly.  And then we were ignored.  Nobody came by to take our order.  Nobody said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right with you.‚Äù  We were ignored.  After 15 min, we got up and walked out.",0
"Food and servers was amazing!  Hostess was a little less than friendly.  Originally didn't have a reservation and was lectured for mot making one.  So went online and made one.
Would highly recommend this place!",4
"Basically the food was underwhelming, lacking in flavor. My halibut had almost zero flavor and barley was undercooked. My friend had the sirloin, $40 for maybe 4 ounces? My wife's pasta dishe also was under seasoned . Just because you're in a high rent district doesn't mean the food should be tasteless!",1
"Overall was a good brunch. Great atmosphere, food was average though nothing special. Primary complaint was the service. The runner brought our food out in a timely manner, but our own server was inattentive and very slow with the drinks and getting our check. We would‚Äôve stayed for another round of drinks but she took so long to even check and see if we needed anything.",2
"Food was excellent, French toast with caramelized banana and Nutella, and the duck confit toast. Soooo good. Great atmosphere, and polite staff.",4
It‚Äôs was okay,2
"Appearances can be deceptive: on initially, the restaurant looks like an extension of the hotel lobby. Later, it turs out to have a focussed menu that was really well executed: juicy fish, fried just right, and a tender steak that was rare just as ordered; not medium-rare.",3
"Live music was great but a little loud for the space.  My friend ordered the Nutella French toast, my other friend ordered the duck confit and I got the bowl.  All three were amazing",4
"I usually do not comment. But I was blown away.  The service was top rate from the hostess down to the waiter, but the food was fantastic!  I travel for a living and  eat at some of the best restaurants around the world and this is up there for me.  The bacon was delicious; best pancakes I‚Äôve had in a long time and the Grey Goose Bloody Marys were unbelievable....   and on top of this a solo guitarist serenaded ya while we ate..... great job and I will definitely be back !!!",4
"This was my first time eating at Outlook Kitchen for brunch. They have a great brunch menu that has both basic breakfast options and local brunch dishes as well. I loved the ambiance with the high tops, booths, and the bar being at the center. They had a live guitarist/vocalist during our brunch which was fitting. Overall, great service as well, we enjoyed our experience.",4
Breakfast was very good - place was not busy and they stopped by often to refill our coffee. Kids loved the food - especially the Nutella French Toast,4
"Went for brunch and the service was atrocious . Took over 15 minutes just to get our first cup of coffee which would be our last as we were never offered a refill or warm up . Same as the drinking water , never refilled . Bloody Mary was very good but I‚Äôve never heard of a $16 Bloody Mary before that‚Äôs more expensive than 50% of their menu . Food was very good but left a bad taste in our mouth as the service was almost non existent. We weren‚Äôt asked how the food was or if we needed anything else . Once we finished eating we had to wait another 20+ minutes until our plates were cleared and we could get the check . All in all very over priced for what you actually get . I guess just being in the seaport means you can rip people off .",1
great experience for dinner,4
"Outlook bar provides great food, service and ambiance.",4
Took 20 minutes to receive 3 mimosas during a fairly slow brunch service. Food was decent but most of it tasted pre-cooked. Great view.,0
Great brunch place!,4
"Decided to take a shot at Outlook for brunch, having never been there and wanting to do brunch during a day trip to the city. I was drawn in by the hotel's website displaying their food, touting the bar (and the really cool looking roof igloos at the rooftop bar!) and decided to give this menu a go. The food was fantastic and came out in a flash. The ambiance was nice, not too close together but cozy with a lot of great light from the high windows lining the wall facing The Barking Crab. The bar menu was varied and gave good options, even for brunch (I'd go back to try some other things later in the day sometime). Service from both the waitstaff perspective and the bartender were great. I'd recommend giving this hotspot a try.",4
Amazing creative chef making amazing food served by great staff.... the vibe was great too! Can‚Äôt get much better than this,4
"I made reservations at the Outlook for New Year‚Äôs Day brunch with two friends. We had high hopes - it has the makings of a great spot. The menu has some inspired dishes and I like the vibe.

The wheels really fell off in the service department. They seemed to be pretty understaffed. We had to keep flagging someone down when we wanted to order, get another drink, or get the check, and finding someone to flag down was problematic, too.

The food was fine - some hits and misses. Overall it felt like an overpriced average meal, but I‚Äôll give them the benefit of the doubt and chock it up to a rough morning.",2
We ordered every small plate except the duck.  Everything was delicious.  I loved the Sangria and words can‚Äôt describe the desserts adequately.  They were fantastic.  I‚Äôll be back with my coworkers.  The service was excellent.  His timing was perfect.,4
"Had a wonderful meal at the Outlook Kitchen and Bar. Very charming space, great food options, and overall great dining experience. Would definitely eat there again.",4
Saturday brunch was great. The Lobster Benedict was perfectly cooked. The potatoes were crispy and delicious. The omelette was light and fluffy. If only you could get a bloody mary for brunch.....,3
"Food was excellent, service was slow despite few diners.",4
Foreign object in my food. Young manager didn‚Äôt care and seemed annoyed that it was pointed out.,0
"Three of us went the night of the Sunday after Thanksgiving and the restaurant was empty (literally there were five people in total in the restaurant).   That said it took a while for our food to come (which was surprising since we were seated right next to the glass enclosed kitchen and the kitchen staff were busier dancing to the music than they were preparing our meals).

It was a nice place but on the expensive side for what it was.

Not sure if I'd try it again.",3
"Really friendly service, decent food with good options but nothing amazing.   Would return for low hassle friendly venue but not recommend if looking for something special.",2
"Although we had been at this restaurant once before with a better experience With the food the service was not  it‚Äôs strength . I was happy that we didn‚Äôt have to order from thanksgiving menu and we had the choice of their regular menu which looked very good when I made the reservation . How ever we were very disappointed when we ordered our appetizer and main entree  as everything we ordered took a long time to arrive even though the restaurant was practically empty !! My eggplant appetizer was very oily and tasteless. My husband filet mignon was not cooked as he ordered it and it arrived cold 
We complained and the manager was very gracious , not only he apologized but took care of the bill and ordered us a flat bread so we don‚Äôt have to leave hungry . 
Maybe because of the holiday they were short staffed and didn‚Äôt have their regular cook ?! The manager wanted us to go back and ask for him so we don‚Äôt have the same experience which very nice and professional 
We like to go back and hope to have a better experience with the food and service k",1
A bit expensive but perfect for a special night out. Staff were extremely helpful and the rooftop view of Boston at night is amazing!,4
Love this place,4
"Elegant and yet inviting modern setting. The staff is wonderfully accommodating, but it is the cuisine that truly makes this restaurant.  The flavors were unique, and wonderfully surprising.",4
I  ordered an omelette and was unaware that it wouldn't be made with REAL EGGS. Needless to say I DID NOT enjoy my meal. Very disappointing as I am not from the area and was hoping to experience something good.,1
Shared several appetizers all were excellent. Great location.,4
"We love this place! The food was great and the atmosphere is awesome BUT the service was very lackluster this morning especially with only a handful of people in the restaurant. We will be back of course, but we were very disappointed this meal especially when hosting family for the weekend.",1
This was a last minute reservation and a pleasant surprise.  Everything was very good (even a snafu - where one dish was left out of an order - was corrrected nicely and with style) - the food surprisingly so,3
Loved this meal!  Can't wait to visit again - and thank you for being accommodating with my dietary restrictions.  Loved the octopus and mussels. I've been dreaming of the salmon ever since we dined. WONDERFUL MEAL!!,4
Everything was wonderful. Bartender Daniel was gracious and informative.  Chef Tatiana stopped by and we complimented her on the fabulous food. Great place.,4
Good food but service is a bit slow.  Better than most hotel establishments.,3
Food was excellent and the view of the skyline was incredible. We went to the rooftop after and it was one of the most romantic nights I've had in boston yet,4
Order a margarita with no salt.  Received a mixture of lemonade and salt water...?,1
"I have tried coming here multiple times. I so want to love this place, but the food is supbar and the service is as well. The view at the Outlook is lovely so perhaps that's why I keep trying the restaurant below. But it always disappoints.",1
It was good but really  went to go to the the rooftop bar.  No food service on rooftop bar.  Went up for a drink.  Fantastic view of the city but for a 30 and under crowd.,3
"We arrived for our reservation and had to wait 10 minutes for a host - there were no other customers in the restaurant. There was no ""scenic view"" as described. We were looking at another restaurant. Hosts/servers made no conversation. Didn't ask if I needed refill on my drink or how my meal was. Definitely won't be heading back here when I return to Boston.",1
Awesome restaurant with delicious food and great service.  Also have a really good brunch!,4
Thought we had booked the bar upstairs but this turned out very well,3
"Drinks were different and tasty, food was just good, waitress was great.",3
"""Kitchen"" lost our order. After an hour they realized it and asked what we ordered. Twenty minutes later dinner came and salmon was over cooked. Probably okay restaurant just not a great experience for us.",1
The hostess could have looked a little more welcoming but other than that I was satisfied with my experience.,3
"Disappointing, booked this to be able to go to the Rooftop Bar.  Big queue on arrival and did not realize dinner was downstairs.  Received a text during dinner to say we would be able to go up to the Rooftop bar.  Showed text to doorman/bouncer he said No you can't go, the texts are out of date !  really?  then why did I received one?  We were told we had to join the queue which was long, even though we had eaten in the restaurant.  Went home disappointed and will not be back.",1
Delicious food and drinks.,4
"steaks were good 
I  would have liked the option to order off of either menu, even if seated in dining room.",3
Awesome place. Nice food and really pleasure environment,4
The service needs significant improvement. I did not expect such a low level of service from Envoy.,2
"Food and service we're very good for brunch, but both inside and outside dining were extremely loud with music from inside and adjacent restaurant outside.  We could barely hear each other speak.  Nice to eat outside, but no view of the water.  Disappointing!    Bloody Marys we're tasty, but didn't make up for noise level.",2
Great experience overall. Fast service. Fresh food. Great atmosphere. Very likely to return soon.,3
"Brought my wife for her birthday. Beautiful location. Food and drinks were perfect. Our waiter was exceptional! Highly recommend the Outlook and a visit upstairs to the rooftop bar, Lookout!",4
"Second time here and both times -  great experiences.  Excellent food and really fun and lively!  

The waiter was a bit flip with us about a dish related question but the general manager(s) were exceptionally responsive to hearing the feedback which was greatly appreciated!  

I really like how the restaurant opens up onto the sidewalk so you can enjoy quality food and what is going on outside too!",4
"With friends, visiting from Manhattan.  Great food, excellent service, and cool decor!  Would definitely visit again when in Boston!",4
"Louder than I thought it would be. Also, from the website, for some reason I assumed the restaurant had rooftop views, given the naming alliteration with that bar.  But it's not, it's on the ground floor.  Outlook and Lookout.  One of them is on the rooftop and the other is not.  The one on the groundfloor says waterfront dining. There is no view of the water, as the Barking Crab is obscuring it.

BUT, the food is EXCELLENT, with amazing options for vegetarians.  And if you have to choose between food and a a view?  I would go with food every time.  (Top of the Hub has an amazing view, but I  would only go there for a drink.)",3
The view is unreal. I 100% recommend this place when the weather is nearly perfect!,4
This was my third time eating dinner here and each time it has been excellent.  The scallops on the main menu are excellent.  Service was very good too.,4
"They charge FOR ICE and refused to serve our drinks neat. Rooftop ambience was nice, but would not recommend for people of color- vibe is a little strange and I inviting. Maybe it's just Boston.",0
"The host did not check us in for our reservation, and the wait for ordering food and finally receiving the food took over an hour. There were not many guests in the restaurant at the time. We were seated at 12:30 and did not receive our food until 2pm unfortunately.",3
"Food was pretty good. It wasn't filling at all though. I had the lobster benedict for brunch and other with me had things like nutella french toast, as well as the flatbread. The service was very lackluster though. The waitress never asked us if we wanted more drinks instead just gave us the bill. We had to ask for the drink menu since she never gave us one. Terrible follow up from the waitress overall, I do think the manager (guy in jeans and blazer) was on his A game though as I saw him hustling around to every table and checking on people. Also the waitress forgot to bring our credit card back to us which was also unusual after paying. Of course we didn't find this out until hours later after we had already left.",2
"The brunch menu was great!  I chose this place for brunch because the location was close to where we were meeting friends from out of town and I wanted to show them the rooftop bar's view of Boston but it's not open until 12, so I figured brunch downstairs would be good to kill time.  The duck confit on toast with spinach, egg, and potatoes was good and the Cuban sandwich was even better.  They offer a regular and spicy Bloody Mary, which was super spicy and delicious and their coffee had a great flavor -- it must be ground onsite.  There weren't very many people there on a Saturday around 11:30am but the service was REALLY slow, so that was the only setback.  I LOVE the decor at the Envoy, the unique wall art (like VHS tapes turned into a painting), the ropes hanging at the booths, even the bathroom was nice modern decor.  The rooftop has a great layout, and there was surprisingly no one there at 12:30pm on a gorgeous, sunny day!  The cocktail lists are great both downstairs and on the rooftop (different lists and somewhat pricey, but very creative and delicious).  I would go back to both!",3
Lovely outdoor setting. Pleasant service. Good menu selection and food quality. Recommend!,3
"My wife left her sweater at the restaurant.  We called when we returned home; they said they had the sweater and would leave it for us at the front desk of the hotel so I could pick it up the next day.  They had no idea where it was when I arrived, never found it, and never apologized for losing it.  This tainted what was otherwise a good experience.",2
"First off the name is a bit misleading. We thought the restaurant was on the rooftop which is why we went. It is instead on the first floor. The restaurant is across from the Barking crab. Out door seating puts you in the same space as the crab. The ambience is ok and maybe it was just this particular day (Friday at 6) but the service was TERRIBLE. We waited a full 15 min before the waitress popped her head in just to tell us she will be right with us. 5 minutes later she showed up and took our drink orders. Another five maybe 10 minutes to actually get them. The menu is not inspiring and waaay over priced for what you get. 25 minutes in without a sip of our drinks (we had water tho from the bus's boys) we had decided we would eat somewhere else...If only we could find the waitress to cancel our drink order. Drinks arrive almost 30 minutes after we got there. Apparently if we were at a table we HAD  to order food. Makes sense I guess but the restaurant was half empty. We decided to finish our drinks and leave...If only we could find the waitress to get our check. A half hearted ""Sorry about the wait"" - once is all we ever got. Not sure she cared one way or another. While we sat there we observed several other tables going through a similar experience as ours....Heads on a swivel looking for the wait staff. Uninspiring and disappointing. The rooftop seemed to be popping however...If you wanted to wait 30 min+ to get in and wait in the line that was around the corner. We bailed on both.",1
Great food not too busy,4
"Excellent sauces on fish and chicken. Saturday night is for the bar set, noisy, jumping. Perfect, if that's what you're looking for.  For a romantic night out, no.",3
We stayed at the Envoy hotel as a little staycation weekend. We dined at the Outlook Kitchen for convenience and we were pleasantly surprised how delicious the food was. We also enjoyed brunch the next morning which was just as good. We will definitely be back.,4
"We waited 40minutes  for  drinks, no check in from waitress.",2
Good spot. Mac & cheese was AMAZING... The filet mignon was nice and tender. Hush Puppies were good apps too.,3
"The entrees were absolutely delicious, but I found the appetizer (tartare) to not quite hit the mark in comparison to the main course. Good bourbon selection, but the waitress didn't know much about it off hand- we were seated next to a computer, so she had to look up the options and read them off the screen. This isn't necessarily a place that specializes in bourbon, but she should be able to at least recall a good number of the options or keep them written in her pad, so she can reference them.  Other than that, service was really good. My only BIG COMPLAINT about the dining experience is that folks who eat a full dinner are not allowed to bypass the line for entry into the Lookout Balcony Bar. We were hoping  to grab a drink there after dinner, but when we realized our patronage got us no expedited treatment (they love to keep the line outside really long even when the balcony is not full to capacity to make it look popular) we left the establishment and went to another bar. I believe they should modify their policy to allow dinner guests (or guests that have a minimum dollar amount for their bill) have immediate access to the balcony.",3
The halibut was great. Enjoyed the atmosphere. Weather was rain but otherwise would have been nice to sit on the patio. Fun and nice for a special occasion or just casual dining.,4
"Food tasted ok but pretty small salad for $15. Waitress never came back to table once (her back to us talking to bartender entire lunchtime) so never got opportunity to ask for (nor were we offered) bread to supplement the small salads. I won't go back, despite working across the street - but perhaps that's why the place was empty at lunchtime.",2
"Fantastic all around, definitely coming back! Dining downstairs was wonderful, after dinner drinks on the rooftop was fun and it's a gorgeous spot with great views!",4
Looovve the brunch,4
Food was over cooked.  Service was excellent,0
Amazing brunch food!,4
Fun drink menu....burgers were very good....though limited menu,3
"Fantastic place! Came for brunch with a friend and we both loved our meal. One of us got the green eggs no ham, and the other got the breakfast sandwich. Not only did it taste amazing but it looked delicious- great presentation. Service was great too! Def will be coming back!",4
Everyone from the hostess to out server was so nice and friendly.  They made us feel welcome.  Saturday brunch was delicious.,3
"Visited the Outlook Kitchen and Bar for Saturday brunch. Great space inside the Envoy hotel!  Restaurant is situated street level overlooking the Bark & Crab restaurant. Very good brunch menu, high quality, local ingredients in some of the dishes.  Our meals were excellent!  Server was attentive and polite.  We were surprised that the restaurant was rather quiet for the time that we were there...?  We can see this place bein a great after work spot and dinner with friends.",4
"Loved the roof top bar, restaurant not so much.  Although they weren't that crowded, service was very slow. Our server seemed harried and much more concerned with large groups of people having drinks at tables near the bar.  Lots of 20 somethings having drinks and enjoying  the bar scene. Warning: music is very loud. Our dinners (halibut, chicken)  were good and could have been outstanding if they had been served hot.  Roof top bar has fabulous views! Great drinks and fun vibe too.",2
"Met a few business associates for lunch.  Waiter was very attentive, and the place was not crowded so we could engage in great conversation.  A little pricey, but overall a good place for a business lunch.",3
"Very good cocktails, attentive service, and original burgers. 
Will come back.",3
"Absolutely love this restaurant that I discovered a few months ago when relatives were in town visiting and wanted a place to go for a birthday dinner.  The Executive Chef, Tatiana Rosana was nice enough to come over to our table and greet us when I asked to speak with her and let her know how much I enjoyed the food.  She greeted me again on my last visit and welcomed me back.  The food is outstanding, decor is modern and the open kitchen and chefs table just add to the whole package. I had the salmon that was outstanding.",4
This restaurant is on the ground floor of the trendy Envoy hotel. I love the brunch options and their cocktails. Their Bloody Mary leaves something to be desired but their other drinks are spot on!,3
Visited Boston area for the weekend...friend recommended the hotel for a great steak & Mac & cheese. It was delicious. We were seated at one table & had requested to move to a more private table & they moved us without a problem. Will definitely go back. A little pricey but you get what you pay for. Great food & good service!,3
We went there for a brunch today and it was really underwhelming. The restaurant was freezing. The food was cold and soggy. We had hoped the view would be of the ocean but there was no view at all. Total disappointment.,1
"I've had the pleasure of dining at Outlook a number of times and always have a great experience.  Tatiana, the Executive Chef, prepares very creative and amazing dishes.  Too many favorites to mention all of them, but her take on smores is amazing.  It's difficult to save room for dessert, but it's definitely worth it!",4
"I went to this restaurant with the intent of conversing with the folks I was with, but the restaurant was so loud I could not talk with the people at the table",2
"Our experience at the Outlook was mixed. On one hand, the food and ambiance were amazing. However, the service was horrible. I am not one to complain about bad service but, it was truly very bad. 

Our waiter was very inattentive and did not check on us at all during the evening. We sat for about 20 minutes with empty drinks, hoping we could catch him to get a new one. However, we were never able to. The most disturbing part of the night was when we ordered our meals. I ordered the chicken dish (which was absolutely amazing and the reason I am not giving this place 1 star). My girlfriend ordered the salmon and the waiter went on his way. When they brought our food out they only brought us the chicken and not the salmon. I thought this was strange because usually they tell you if the other dish is going to come out after. We waited about 15 minutes because our waiter never came back to the table. Finally, we had to flag down another server (who was very helpful) to have our waiter come back to the table. It turns out he ""didn't hear"" my girlfriend's order. I mean, don't you think you'd double check if you thought only one person was going to order a meal? Anyways, no apology was issued and we waited another 20 minutes for my girlfriend's salmon to come out. They did not offer to remake my meal so we could eat together. We ended up having to eat completely separately. No apology, not offer for a free drink or something small to make up for his mistake. 

I think I would come back and dismiss this as a one-off because the food was so good and we loved the decor of the restaurant. However, if we get the same server we will be requesting another one.",2
Terrific food congenial atmosphere although loud with after work crowd and fun music.  Service was attentive pleasant and professional. Would definitely return.,3
Went here for the first time on Valentine's Day. The set menu they were running was delicious. Loved the  open kitchen. Our waiter was also great! I will be back to check out the normal menu & lounge area.,4
"We met friends at Outlook for dinner. Rebecca was our server. She took very good care of us, guiding us through the menu, making sure, our glasses remained ful and all our requests were expeditiously taken care of. The food was fabulous....delicious and interesting. A very enjoyable evening, we will be back soon.",4
"We scheduled a business lunch at the restaurant, which is conveniently located right across  the federal courthouse. The food was excellent - from the Brussels and egg salad, to the tomato soup, to the Cubano and the flatbread. Everything was brought out to the table within 10 minutes and was piping hot. Because we had an additional hour to hang out before the scheduled appointment time, we ordered coffees all around (French press!) and worked at the table.  Our server was incredibly amazing and comp'd the coffees - a big plus in addition to the great service. We'll definitely be back. Last thing, if it is important to you, they've got wifi available for patrons.",4
This was the perfect spot to have lunch! I had the brussel sprout salad with chicken and it was incredibly healthy and yummy!,4
I had the lobster Benedict and my boyfriend had a steak and eggs. Both dishes were extremely savory and good portions. We had craft cocktails as well and I was very satisfied. This is probably one of my favorite brunch spots in the city.,4
"Great experience, AMAZING food, & cool atmosphere. Great for a group brunch; possibly a little too noisy for 2 people looking to chat. We just wish our waiter packed our breakfast potatoes in our to-go bag :(",4
"I think they are still working out the kinks. They did not serve breakfast at 1:00 pm on a Saturday because it was Christmas Day. Also, the clam chowder comes with actual clams. The fish croquettes were just okay. Out waitress was very accommodating. We were just thrown off by lack of what we came to order.",0
had high expectations. disappointed in the food especially,2
I came here for an early business meeting for breakfast at 7:00am. Our server was very attentive. I got the Steak and Eggs with truffle hollendaise. It was absolutely delicious and I'll be back!,4
Food was ok...service slow at times.  Very noisy with loud music during dinner.,1
Great food. Overpriced but look where you are,3
Everything was great except we got the muscles for an appetizer and they were very fishy and gamie.  We told our waiter and he took them away but offered no replacement suggestion and kept them on the bill besides the fact we hardly ate them.  Was disappointed.,3
The Nutella banana French toast is easily the best I've ever tasted.  This place should do brunch all the time,4
"My wife and I were staying at the hotel and wanted something that was close and easy.  The restaurant provided the perfect atmosphere.  The service was perfect - our server was extremely friendly and helped us with our food and beverage choices.  She was very knowledgeable about everything associated the food and menu.  It was great talking with her and you could tell she was very proud of the food, chef and everything associated with the restaurant.  She even told the manager we were there for a special date weekend and they brought over a glass of bubbly for us.  The food was amazing!  And the dessert - you must try the smore brownie with the homemade marshmallow (which is smoked).  I highly recommend trying Outlook Kitchen and Bar.",4
Great service and hearty portions.,3
"Food was good, not great. I was expecting s little bit more. Never lost the feeling that I was in a hotel lobby.",2
Peas and carrots appetizer was amazing. The pork chop entree was the best I've ever had!,4
"Overall, not the experience I expected from such a nice place that I was anxious to try. Our drinks were sitting at the bar and no one delivered them for quite awhile. The spicy bloody marys that were ordered were entirely too spicy to the point they were difficult to drink. I ordered eggs benedict that I know came with poached eggs because it stated it on the menu and I saw another table with poached eggs, however mine came out scrambled which I never specified I wanted. The manager heard my complaint as he walked by because he stopped for a second but then never actually acknowledged the mistake. In addition, the bathroom did not have hand towels, which I informed the manager about and all he did was nod and just kept standing there. Not intending to go back in the near future.",2
We had to wait a very long time before our waiter cane to our table. Overall the experience was ok but I've had better service from past visits.,2
Food was good but overpriced and lacking flavor,2
Wonderful meal and service on a Friday night.  Flavors of everything were outstanding and Stephanie our server was so upbeat and knowledgeable.,4
Don't get the muscles!!,2
"Food is spectacular, location is unbeatable, service is alright",3
"The restaurant us very nice. However, drinks menu is poor and quality is very low for both a restaurant and Outlook Bar. 

Food was good, but it was  brought to us in less then 15 mins (drinks were not even ready yet). I don't know if it was pre-cooked.

It is OK place for a quick bite before going to the roof top.",2
Food was over priced and the portion for the entrees were so small for the cost. My steak looked like an appetizer. Won't recommend for dining. Next time just go to the roof top for drinks,2
"The experience is best enjoyed by first making a stop at the rooftop bar to take in the Boston skyline, then going down to the kitchen.  It was our anniversary and we had a good experience.  It's rather noisy but we knew that going in and accepted it. Very trendy atmosphere.",3
"Had dinner here with my wife on a Saturday night. Have to say that valet parking at $40 is a complete rip-off. I understand that it is a hotel, but they should have a different rate for people just dining not staying the night. In any event plenty of parking just a short walk away.

We arrived a little early, had a drink at the bar - I prefer beer, not the best selection in the world, but not bad. I did notice a great selection of Vodka and scotch/whiskey.

After our drink we had a nice hightop table next to the open windows - they also have outdoor seating, but not much of a view -  just good people watching. Service was a bit slow to start, but our server mentioned they were extremely understaffed for some reason. The rest of the night she was fantastic, we were not in a rush in any event and thought her attentiveness was perfect. 

My wife had their scallops and was still raving about them the next day. I had the chicken which was also excellent. We both shared a flatbread and mussels as an appetizer. I thought both were fantastic, but my wife did not care for the Thai preparation of the mussels, she prefers a more traditional Italian broth.

We had a blueberry desert which was very different, not sweet, but delicious. Would recommend it.",3
"Great place to eat!  Outside seating overlooking the bustling barking crab.  Awesome waitress, great food.  End the evening with a nightcap on the hotels rooftop bar.",3
"Food and drinks were good. Service was very slow, drinks arrived with food about 30 minutes after sitting down. There were about 6 people in the restaurant so business was not the problem. Bathroom was not clean (read: gross) and no hand soap in the dispenser.",1
"The food was incredible but the service was incredibly slow eventhough the restaurant was not that busy. Would definitely recommend this place for the food and willing to try it again, but hoping that the service is a little better next time!",1
"From my initial dealings with the hostess, Megan, to the impeccable service provided by our waitress, Shylah, the dining experience was superlative. The food presentation was creative and the taste delicious. The chef, Tatiana, deserves accolades as the culinary genius behind this remarkable meal!",4
"Was so much fun.  Restaurant was very cool, food was good ,and drinks were awesome.  Went upstairs to the rooftop bar which was great.  The view was fabulous.",4
Came here for my best friends bachelorette dinner and love everything about this place!!! Our server was attentive and helpful! Will sure to be making reservations again very soon!,4
"The breakfast choices were plentiful and the food was delicious. Our server was not the greatest, having to be reminded twice about our toast which came after we were done with the meal. No one ever asked if we want to juice either, which is odd for breakfast. The atmosphere was very noisy as there were some young children who were not being supervised by their parents running around during the meal. I know this is a difficult  issue, but the staff seemed unaware of how to deal with it",3
"While the food was very creative and well done, the noise level was very off putting. It is tied to the upstairs overlook bar,which is very young, and very loud. The website makes it appear to be one in the same. It is not. It's ground floor with no view worth mentioning. The bar is open air and upstairs. Still the food made up for a lot.",3
Hot day and not enough A/C but the food was good and service from bar tenders was above average.,3
"Went for dinner with the in laws. Great wait staff. Kitchen had problems. Our 1.5 HR dinner turned into 2,25 hrs. And on a Monday night. And since we were seated right near the kitchen, we had no idea why they had such a problem.",2
"We chose Outlook based on the good review in the paper and it's location for where we were going after.  We were very pleased with the modern look of the restaurant.  The modern theme carried into the appetizers and the Shrimp was crisp on the outside and tender on the inside and just the right portion.  The list of entrees was not lengthy, but I'd rather see a handful of things done right, than a choice of many average things.  We both had flank steak which was cooked just right and the chimichurri was a nice touch.   Our server was top-notch!  She was informative and friendly without over-doing it.  The wine list was fine for a glass or two but the bottle list was a little lacking, as our first TWO choices were unavailable and apparently someone had to dig to find a bottle of our 3rd choice.  Finally it must also be said that this may be in the Top Ten locations in Boston for people-watching.",3
"Arrived on time for reservation, was seated, waited nearly half an hour for drinks (times by clock) server sent her manager to apologize, said her section was too busy (it was, although the restaurant as a whole was not) and nobody was assisting her. Drinks were comped without us asking for it. Mixed drink was very good, beer was served in a can (atmosphere is undefined, is it casual corner bar or hip, trendy hangout?) bartender is a SNOB. Decided to ask for wine when waiting for the drinks that took half an hour, bartender said ""sure"" and then ignored me completely. Walked away from the bar without the wine, finished our comped drinks and left. Not returning, this was a special occasion (birthday,start of the night out) and it was momentarily ruined",1
"Great view from rooftop, but don't be deceived- you won't be dining on the rooftop, despite the name being called Outlook. The drinks were great, especially the watermelon vodka drink!! The food wasn't bad, but it was incredibly expensive for the quality, and our service was slow. If you want to have a drink on the rooftop, ask your server right when you sit down, so they can be sure you don't have to wait in the long long LONG line.",3
"Begin with their rooftop bar that overlooks Boston Harbor and draws a crowd though service is still quick. Then prepare yourself for a culinary delight. Rebecca was my waitress and she navigated me through the selections with solid explanations and shared her favorites. I followed her advise and washed it down with a nice Gavi wine. Rebecca ordered my dessert, a blueberry compote, and it is to die for. I will go back next time I am in Boston. If you can, ask for Rebecca as she is professional, courteous, and friendly; most of all, she has food knowledge that will make for a memorable culinary experience.",4
"Outlook restaurant was a beautiful classy place! Felt very upscale without over the top prices. We had the Envoy burgers and they were the best burgers we have ever had...., imagine that! Out waiter even put a candle in some yummy Ice cream when I told him my Birthday was the next Day!! So sweet!! So after that,  we went up to the Lookout rooftop Bar and it was AMAZING !! Love the views of the Boston waterfront at night
...you seriously have to try this place...yes it was that great!!!!",4
"We had brunch here early on a Saturday and it was quiet. We sat next to the window and ordered the Greenway Hash and the BELTA breakfast sandwich. The Greenway Hash was very good, refreshing and and light for a breakfast dish which I loved and the sandwich was sooo good. The shredded maple bacon was delicious! We would definitely go back.",2
Too expensive For a night out. The restaurant should really specify whether or not it is on the roof. The bar is a great vibe but totally separate from the restaurant. Also enjoyed the food but it wasn't big enough portions for the price. Wouldn't eat here again but would drink here for the ambiance. Also the hostesses didn't acknowledge our presence until 10 mins after they saw us.,2
"Very good food and excellent service. Patio is great, but the views are blocked by the barking crab.  Food quality is very high and appetizers are very inventive, but main dishes are are ""European sized"". Although, returning from you Europe, where portions can rival Cheesecake Factory portions, I should say that for main course size there are many other places. I would gladly return and limit myself to drinks (good selection) and tapas. Also, if you have a chance and you're not hungry, head for the rooftop lounge - fun, fun, fun!!!",3
"The food was decent in this very well located restaurant but the experience was spoiled by a couple of hostesses who declined to sit us outside despite the fact that the outdoor terrace was almost empty.

The disturbing piece was the poor excuses we were given. They did not even make sense. So much so that after insisting they promptly gave up and sat us outside. All of it with an attitude that definitely helps Boston being voted one of the rudest city in America.

I would think that when you have an outdoor asset like they have you would want to facilitate access to it. Unless you are trying to reserve it for a certain kind of patrons... Not for us obviously.",2
"Air conditioning was not on, which made for a very hot summer meal.  Service was excellent and laid back.",4
"Very cute restaurant! Loved the open kitchen. The food was very tasty, well seasoned, well prepared and nicely presented.
Server was not attentive at all and seemed bored to be there. He would hardly smile, never tried to make us feel welcome. 
The part that I really disliked and thought it was really rude from the restaurant was the fact that when they closed, they turn all light back up and the place was super bright although we where still enjoying our dinner. But we are not talking 30 minutes or more after they closed. The place was as bright as daylight the second the doors closed. We had to hurry up and eat and couldn't really enjoy the nice meal.",2
"The temperature was awful and really warm, we asked our food to be divided in smaller plates and they would not accommodate our request. Overall a really bad experience. Will not recommend to anybody.",0
"Love both Outlook and Lookout at the Envoy! You can have a bite to eat downstairs and finish off with a night-cap at Outlook. Dining gets you preferred access to the rooftop bar, which is very busy in the summer! Highly recommend the cocktails, always changing and using the best local ingredients!",4
Went before a concert and it was great exactly what we were expecting and looking for,3
Music section was questionable for Sunday brunch otherwise great.,3
"Brunch was AMAZING! We went on a Saturday morning, so it was quiet. The waitress was super nice and helped me plan a birthday surprise for a friend. The food was incredible, I highly recommend the Caprese salad. The view, the food, the decor is all perfect and makes for a wonderful experience.",4
The food was bad not tasty at all  the menu was small the service was not pleasant the ambience was dull the rooftop closed early because of lack of business on the 4th of July  so couldn't experience  the famous rooftop  was a waste of money never again üò°,0
we Get A Really Nice feeling dining at Outlook.,4
Nice restaurant.  Service was weak due to a large private party that showed up and they didn't have any additional servers.,3
"The service was some of the worst service I have ever received. We initially ordered two drinks and two appetizers. The two drinks took 45 minutes at a half empty restaurant. The food came out before two drinks! The food was pretty good, albeit the entree selection was lacking. After the drinks were dropped off we didn't see our waitress one more time. It took me 45 minutes of going through other servers to close our tab. I sent my girlfriend next door to the Barking Crab to ensure that we would be able to get a seat as soon as we got out of Outlook. After speaking to some friends who have tried it out they reported that they had terrible service too. I won't be going back and I will be recommending people to stay away.",0
"Good food !
Very pleased with the service",4
The menu and drinks were phenomenal. The majority of the wait staff seemed overwhelmed and disengaged,3
"I had high expectations for this place.  Overall, I think it is very good.  Not great, but very good.  Our server was friendly and mostly responsive, but had to be reminded to bring one or two things.  The ham and cheese oatmeal was creative, rich and delicious, but the bun for my Lobster PLT tasted a bit stale.  I think our friends enjoyed the french toast and pancakes, so perhaps it depends on what you order?  The decor and Fort Point channel location are fabulous, so I will probably give this place another chance.",3
"I had noted and also called in that it's a birthday dinner. 

They confirmed that our dessert would come with a candle. When we ordered, no candle.

They also put us at a table by the bar rather than a sit down table. So constantly bar goers were elbowing us while we were eating

Very inconsiderate of the staff to not move our table when there were so many empty.",0
I've visited the restaurant a number of times and always ask for JC! He is on top of his game. Highly recommend.,4
"My boyfriend and I were visiting  Boston for the weekend and chose to dine at the Outlook Kitchen for our first meal in the city- what a bust! We were surprised to know that our reservation was on the main floor of the hotel, not on the rooftop... which was not clear on the website or Opentable. Also, we noticed that people around us were eating different food than what was on the menus given to us, when I asked about this the waiter informed me that they had the bar menu?! Why were we not given this in the first place? The options were much better. 

I got the pasta for my meal, which was probably the worst pasta I have ever eaten. Very disappointing. I ended up just getting a salad off the bar menu which was FINE, not even good. 

My boyfriend got the steak which was very good, thank goodness. 

After our meal we were brought up to the rooftop for a drink which had beautiful views of the city... The only reason this experience wasn't a 0.",1
"We were dining al fresco on a summer night. We waited for 15 to 20 minutes for some one to come to the table to take a drink order. The entrees were very, very small. Both my husband and adult son left dinner hungry! Very poor restaurant overall for a Marriotüòü",1
Went here for appetizers and ended up staying for dinner. We got a few plates to share the Tuna Poke was amazing and so was the pizza. highly recommend,3
"You guys. Never reviewed a restaurant. But this place was really something. Left an hour ago and my wife & I are still laughing. Look we're not food snobs. Don't care about ceviche or edamame or some stuff. Just real people with a babysitter. My wife ordered the steak. With potatoes? Not really. She got like 4. We kept waiting for the server to put down more food but he didn't. 75% of her plate was legit empty. We just kept making eye contact with each other trying not to laugh.  It was $29! Coulda spent that on dry cleaning. Total comedy show. We asked for the check but got another round of drinks instead. Not even more booze was gonna salvage this. We actually returned the drinks. Has anyone with 2 kids ever done that?  Probably not. Got the check, went next door to the Barking Crab for beers and were totally happy.",0
"Underwhelming overall. Food and service were okay. We had a table by the window, so the best aspect was the people-watching.  Seems like a better place for the bar scene and a quick bite.",1
"One of the best meals I have ever had and I travel extensively.

Clearly a hot spot - great bar scene - outdoor dining

It's the full package!",4
Seems like a good place.,3
My wife and I went to dinner for our anniversary and had a lot of fun. Food was excellent and the  spot was very cool. Service was exemplary. We highly recommend!!,4
"Great food, best burger ever and Stephanie our server was superb. they went above and beyond, delicious gift dessert and private tour of the rooftop bar which is open soon. decor and atmosphere were just right. loved this place and will go back as soon as we can.",4
"Unexpected surprise in the Seaport.  Good vibe, solid service and great cocktails / food.",3
"Excellent food! Would definitely come again for brunch, dessert, and drinks!!  Service very slow though",3
"Service and food were great. They had live music the night we were there, which was a nice touch but it was a little noisy (they needed to adjust turn down her speaker just a bit). But I would still go back!",4
We came for my mothers birthday. The music was great!,4
"We were excited to try this restaurant after reading prior reviews, however we were quickly disappointed. Our server didn't seem to know anything about the menu in regards to what was listed, portion sizes, etc. and instead of asking someone for clarification, he clearly made up information as he went. The menu looked amazing at a glance, however each of our entrees were lacking anything special. The chicken was dry and lacked seasoning and the flank steak was not cooked well (we didn't even bother sending it back at that point). The portion sizes were also very small so we had to grab a snack post dinner. We would not recommend for dinner, but possibly drinks and appetizers.",0
Poached eggs were overcooked twice. Remainder of lobster Benedict got cold while waiting for eggs. No attempt to keep the rest of the food warm.,1
"I had an amazing time at this restaurant! The hostess was super nice and offered me a great table. My server, Stephanie, was kind and very good at explaining me the dishes and giving suggestions.
I had a delicious mocktail, since I don't drink alcohol: a tropical drink that tasted like a mojito with fresh mint, very colorful and yummy. The food is awesome! I tried a great salad to start and a pasta with kale pesto - super tasty! 
Congratulations! I will be back!",4
"The Outlook is a hip, fun restaurant located within the trendy Envoy Hotel in the Seaport district.  The food is creative and well-prepared (we can highly recommend both the mac & cheese and the burger) and the drink menu has something for everyone --from the adventurous to those who like more standard offerings.  The mood is upbeat and lively, and although it has tall ceilings and is open to the hotel lobby, it's easy to carry on a conversation with your dining companions.  The one area for improvement is the service.  All waitstaff were attentive and well-meaning, but they are inexperienced, which shows up in various ways throughout the dining experience.  We read a few reviews that basically said the same thing.  It's not a reason not to go to the Outlook, but it does create a few shake your head moments.",3
"This was terrific in all ways. We did recommend that they carry a higher quality Pinot Grigio, even if it cost a little more, as the one we had was rather flavorless. They welcomed the feedback.",4
The food was amazing. Our tastetaste buds were continually delighted. The kids were amazed by the gelato and the campfire torte. The macaroons were to die for. Obviously a very talented chef and pastry chef.,4
Lobster Benedict and Nutella French toast were delicious. Would be a great place in the summer.,3
"I almost don't want to review this so highly, so that it doesn't get too busy! The food was amazing, service was spot on, and the wine list was not too pricey for the area.

Flat iron steak, gnocchi appetizer, and bread pudding were standouts.",4
"Stephanie, our server is the best! Chef is attentive and take pride in his food. Good choice overall. Will be back!",3
this is a really fun location... Cool space... Great service from Stephanie.   Fairly priced wine list.   Needs  more under $20   items on the bar menu. Can't wait to try the patio and roof deck thi summer,3
"Recently opened in the Envoy hotel.  The view was of the Barking Crab.  Tables are well spaced and when we went (Christmas night) not busy.  The dining and bar room are in one open space; clean and industrial.  TVs with the BB game on, but no volume; jazz music was playing.  Our server was happy, helpful, and informed.  The wine pours were generous, you got a mini carafe!  I got the King Salmon which was fresh, tasty, and nicely seared with a rare center.  My wife got the Pappardelle which was light and full of flavor.  We shared the gelato sample of 3 flavors out of 5 options which turned out to be 4 since they ran out of one.  I want to give it 5 stars, but need a second visit to validate that.  Can‚Äôt wait for the rooftop to open!",3
The salad and appetizers were delightful but ambience noisy and service was very rushed and not friendly even though the restaurant had many empty tables !! We may consider going back in the summer time and may be for lunch only,1
"The food was amazing! Server was incredibly nice, but service was a bit slow. Overall though, it was a really good experience. Definitely recommend.",4
Boston has some great restaurants... Unfortunately this is not one of them. The space is interesting and I imagine even more interesting in summer. The problem here is that the staff needs to be trained properly. When I asked for advice from the wine steward... Advice was RELAYED to us by the waitress. When our $80 bottle of wine arrived... The waitress opened it before it arrived at the table. She poured a FULL glass of wine for me to taste it. She then screwed the cap back on the bottle after she served. I could go on but you need to stop reading reviews for this restaurant so you can find one with trained staff.,2
Selected Outlook based on the unique breakfast selections and they did not disappoint,3
"Loved it!  Hesitant to spoil future availability by giving it a great rating, but have to be honest.  The halibut was delicious and very fresh.  Try the super cool S'mores dessert!",4
It is on the ground level. It is priced higher than a ground floor pub.,2
I‚Äôm sure this bar is a lovely spot for after work drinks but it is not clear when booking that the bar is on the ground floor of the shard and when you Google sky bars London it‚Äôs one of the first that comes up which is very deceiving! We were sat outside beside the escalator which had zero atmosphere. I believe if we sat inside we may have had a better experience however the drinks are overpriced and we would have been charged ¬£30 if we had cancelled with short notice or walked away so we stayed for one drink and left. Very disappointed overall!,1
Believed I was booking for a bar that was up the Shard so very disappointed that Bar 31 was tucked away on the ground floor,2
very nice venue - just a surprise that last orders were at 9:30pm and the bar closed at 10:30pm on a Thursday.,2
"Underwhelming , not a great deal of atmosphere and I didn‚Äôt feel like I was in the shard! Very average bar",1
"We didn‚Äôt understand that the bar was on the ground level. We thought it was on the 31st floor because of the name.
We were very disappointed when we couldn‚Äôt book a table at the other restaurants.
We went there because of the view which we were unable to see due to this.",1
Service was particularly slow. We had to ask for everything at least once. Not worth the money.,1
Great customer service- lovely staff . They really took care of their customers,2
"Delicious pizza from a narrow menu. We had the margarita, tiramisu and soft drink option that was great value for money. Dining in at 3pm was incredibly quiet. The staff were attentive and efficient.",3
On the ground floor typical hotel bar that don't stands up for the hotel's prestige...,0
"Disappointing, basically wedges in the corner of the lobby / disused space under an escalator.
Overpriced and limited selection of drinks.",0
Le Bar 31 du Shard se situe au rendez de chauss√©e du building. Je pensais b√™tement qu'il √©tait au 31√®me √©tage. Quelle erreur. Le cocktail √©tait bon dans un choix tr√®s restraint. Je ne recommande pas variment,2
"It‚Äôs a small bar in the ground floor, it is beautiful, very aesthetic and the service was excellent but it‚Äôs very expensive for what they offer. They have the same prices as the bars and restaurants upstairs that has gorgeous views. The only view you‚Äôve got in the bar is a escalator and a lift. Very expensive, you can get a much better experience in other bar for the SAME PRICE.",0
"The bar staff did not have any idea on drinks, cocktails, what an irish whisky was nor a craft beer",0
Some food were not available but the service was very good.,3
It was amazing service and everybody were so nice and accommodating to us!,4
nothing special and ground floor. drinks are ok and price is high.,0
Overpriced and we were overcharged for our drinks. Really poor‚Ä¶,0
"You asked if it was any occasion we were going for and I said it was a birthday and when asked if there was anything you could do I said maybe a small note or card saying happy birthday. Nothing happened so not really sure what the point of being asked / answering this was?

Aside from this it was nice, drinks nice, waiters friendly and good atmosphere",3
Total waste of time and money. Not at all as expected.,0
Pizzas were not available. Food options limited. We had a booking but told to wait even though the restaurant was empty.,1
"We booked to go into the shard and it was misleading . It was for a special occasion so was quite upset . The bar is on ground level please be warned if booking .  
No menu available service was shocking even though they charged us a service charge! 
So disappointed",0
"Some of the dumbest servers I've ever seen. Kitchen closed ridiculously early, zero variety in the menu and they all seemed WAY too eager to make us leave, sweeping stuff of the table while we were barely finished with it.",0
"Staff made this experience special
Food was a bit of a letdown, not many options",4
"There was little food available from the menu only chips, toilets smell was terrible and permeated the bar. Very little ambience and pretty poor value. service overall was good.",1
"ON THE GROUND FLOOR - DO NOT BOOK

Wish I could rate lower‚Ä¶

Bar 31 is in fact on the ground floor - so completely misleading that isn‚Äôt in the Shangri-La section.

We were obviously disappointed and wanted to move on to another location as it‚Äôs essentially a low budget cafe, however we got told by a rude staff member that we would be charged the cancellation fee if we left‚Ä¶ not quite sure that‚Äôs how it works?!

So when we did get a seat (outside) and asked the waiter what gins they had for a gin and tonic, they had no idea what they offered. The service overall was rude and inattentive, and it was not an enjoyable experience.

Completely disappointing and misleading, therefore moving forward I will be telling everyone to avoid this place.

Lastly, I‚Äôd like to add that I am not a complainer. I can usually make the best out of a bad situation and it is not just the misleading aspect that was disapoitning, it was the poor quality of service following this.

So genuinely, could not recommend that you avoid this place enough.",0
"Absolutely terrible service from the hotel concierge when we arrived.  Didn't want to try and help us even find the place!  The name of this venue is completely misleading, it is on the GROUND FLOOR!!!

Do not be fooled by the name, this bar is not on the 31st floor of the Shard!!!",0
"At around booking fm
Time Bar was not ready to take in customer as very restricted menu was offered to us .",0
Great service and atmosphere. Lovely bar and a great shelter from the winter weather.,4
"Very convenient meeting place. Nice & airy, prompt & friendly service.",3
"Overpriced 
underwhelming
Not worthy of recommending",0
I had made a reservation but was told you were fully booked!  When I pressed the point about booking the manger found us a seat. Big group of people in so very noisy.,2
"Tragic. The place doesn't do the Shangri-la brand any justice. Not inviting, nor welcoming, simple menu which would be fine if executed well. I've been to many Shangri-la hotels in Asia and this outpost doesnt do the brand any favours. From the hotel door staff's lack of smiles, its all uninviting and stone cold to me. At least the staff did know what to do with my Jade membership (Shangri-la's frequent traveler's program), sadly I wont be coming back I'd rather stay at home.",0
"They didn‚Äôt have my reservation booked in and so plonked us on a high bench. Poor service, ridiculous service charge just for drinks and nuts. Nil atmosphere and noisy football on above our heads!!!",0
Very poor experience outside table booked for 8.45pm only to be told bar31 was closed at 08.30 and we were not allowed entrance.  Door staff not helpful at all .,0
We arrived for our booking and were told that we couldn't come in as there was a function.,0
"Lovely cocktails, good service. Convenient for London Bridge station.",3
A small pizza took to long to come to the table. Almost an hour wait,2
"Not great to say it is part of the Shangri-La. Service was ok, food choice very limited. Good if you want a very quick snack and like pizza!",2
Bar 31 was great. We only had drinks so I can‚Äôt comment on the food. The cocktails were really lovely. We mostly had the Halloween specials which were all delicious and well priced. We sat outside (in October!) which was lovely because it was still a nice temperature but it was also sheltered. The staff were really attentive particularly Anbu and Roxamou (sorry if I‚Äôve spelt that wrong). We got our drinks quickly and they were really friendly. I would recommend this bar to anyone.,4
It was really disappointing - not on the floorlevel 31 and a bar without any charme. The drinks weren't delicious and too expensive for what you get. We definitely do not recommend this bar at anyone.,0
Drinks were lovely and the bar itself is gorgeous. Will definitely return next time we visit London,4
"Super misleading! They should be transparent everywhere making it clear they are NOT on the 31st floor, but on the ground floor with NO view.",0
"Like many other reviewers, I was shocked to find this restaurant is on the ground floor of the Shard. I suppose I should have read the reviews prior to booking! Although we had a reservation, they did not ask for my name and told us to sit wherever we like. I was worried I would be charged the ¬£15/pp cancellation fee if my name was not taken. Service was very slow and very un-friendly. Had one quick drink just to use the reservation slot and then was still lucky enough to get a walk-in spot at AquaShard upstairs.",0
"Quality of drinks and service was good, no complaints but it was a dead place for a bar at 730pm on bank holiday weekend. No one else except us inside. 
There can be many much more lively places to visit.",2
Only came for drinks but was sitting down for 50minutes eventually I left as they never came.,0
"It was not worth it. Bar ‚Äú31‚Äù is located at the ground floor, right under the scalator to the rail station. If you cancel they charge you ¬£30!!! Definitely not recommend",0
"Very cosy , clean with friendly staff",4
"We did not have any food however the drinks were absolutely divine and the service was brilliant. So polite and friendly, very efficient and overall fantastic.",4
"Very disappointing based on how it is shown online, absolutely fine for a stop off drink but not somewhere you would be keen to book in to not miss.
The photos online are clearly taken from one corner. Expected to be in a lovely garden but instead were in an outdoor area at the side of a building which is under an escalator.",1
"Brilliant service. Friendly, attentive staff and a lovely atmosphere!",4
"The staff here are lovely, great pizza and wonderful service. It‚Äôs casual and a place to stop in a nice setting 

The only downside is there is no air con inside",3
We didn‚Äôt eat so ignore the food review. Overall nice bar,4
I made the mistake of ordering spirits at this bar. ¬£32 for a single gin and tonic and a single gin and soda. Completely extortionate. And service was very slow.,1
It is not in the 31 floor. I don‚Äôt recommend this bar. It is better to make a reservation in Aqua. The prices are almost the same and the view is awesome up there!,1
"Good experience, staff were helpful but there were now enough staff to keep up with demand",3
241 on a Sunday at 4pm was spot on! We loved it. Would recommend.,4
Awful service. Ignorant staff. Do not recommend...,0
Don‚Äôt be fooled that this bar is even remotely connected to the shard. It is tiny. On the ground floor. Has no atmosphere and certainly no view. The staff attire looks pretty casual and the drinks are raving expensive. Overall it‚Äôs a tourist trap I fell into. Won‚Äôt be doing it again.,1
Great atmosphere and very attentive staff. Shame its not actually on the 31st floor as the name would suggest,4
Went yesterday was a nice place but the waiter was rude we had to look at the menu from an app and did not have much choice of drinks over all very poor waited ages for drinks to,1
"Drinks were nice but expensive! Service was poor, wrong  mixer twice - still charged extra for service. We were given a table under the stairs in the shade despite booking for a birthday celebration. Asked to pay for drinks before receiving the correct ones and change was brought just before we were leaving. Both the waiter and waitress who served us were unfriendly. Wouldn‚Äôt go again. Table and service so poor we ate elsewhere!",0
"We did not have food.
Service excellent.
Music too loud to hold a conversation.
Disappointed it wasn‚Äôt on 31st floor!",2
It‚Äôs on the 1st floor. 2 for 1 Moscow Mule wasn‚Äôt decent.,1
Entire bar area smelled like a toilet and mice spotted running around a table inside. Would NOT recommend!!!!,0
"Of the different places to eat at The Shard, this is the most affordable. Note that the bar is on the ground floor, so no views across London from this bar.
Drinks were to a high standard and served quickly and efficiently.
We shared a platter which was varied and plentiful. We wrapped up the meal with a bowl of fries, which was plentiful and supported by a sprinkling of parmesan and a truffle mayonnaise.
Overall, a great experience but slightly disappointed by the ground floor location.",3
We turned up on time said I had a table booked the girl just said ok didn‚Äôt ask for my name just said you can sit outside or inside nobody came up to us to ask if we want food or anything very bad service would never go back again,0
"Groundfloor of Shard, nice bar and atmosphere. Friendly employees.",3
Miss leading ‚Ä¶.. not in the shard at all. Mediocre cocktails. Ground floor basic bar.,0
"I was looking forward to my visit but I felt it was very much below par.
Tables dirty , waiter didn‚Äôt understand me and not b
Very helpful 
I expected better 
Sorry just my opinion",1
The staff were all incredibly helpful and friendly and answered all question we had,4
The most amazing experience we have ever had! The staff were so lovely and and polite ü•∞ will definitely be coming again! x,4
"Yes I recommend this bar. It‚Äôs cozy, good decoration, and staff are nice. Not warm, and welcome, but still nice. The bar does not have non alcoholic drinks, but if you ask they will do.",3
Extremely over priced for a very average bar. I wouldn‚Äôt go back.,1
"I took my daughter here for pre drinks ,whilst waiting for our table reservation  at Ting.
The bar had no peroni beer ,no still water ,no truffle chips.It was quite a let down considering  it was a birthday celebration.",1
Food looked good but better places to eat around!!,1
Lovely time  2 for 1 in happy hour 4pm to 6pm  happy days,4
Disappointing. This is on the ground level. Also small and basic drink meny and expensive. Would not recommend,0
Lovely space for some quiet social space for a social meetup for drinks and maybe  snack. Service was lovely and friendly.,4
"Very disappointing venue especially as I had thought I'd booked Aquashard bar 31 floors up.
 This Bar 31 is just a bar. Did not eat or drink, just left. Staff very very pleasant tho. üëçüèª",0
"Bar31 is not what it appears to be on the internet.  Firstly it‚Äôs on the ground floor.  Its more like a caf√© serving alcohol than a bar.  We did go there during the day so it may be different later.  Food/drinks were expensive, no atmosphere, uncomfortable tables.  From what I understand it is in no way connected to the Shangri la Hotel therefore no remotely luxurious.",0
"One assumed Bar 31 was on the 31st floor of the Shard. My mistake. Was on ground floor tucked around the side, seats uncomfortable, table dirty and music was too loud to have a conversation.

Conclusion - never return.",0
When we spoke to the bookings staff they was very unhelpful. But bar staff was very helpful. Small tables and over priced drinks considering you could be anywhere there is no view,1
Too expensive,2
"Totally overrated, very expensive and no atmosphere! Don‚Äôt waste your time or money",0
Really disappointing.  The photos don't match the reality and service (which we had to pay for) was none existent.,0
"Very good service, nice place for a drink. Yes, is in the ground floor, but is a nice place for a drink and a bite! The building is superb.",3
"This place is misleading to the greatest degree. It says it‚Äôs part on the Shangri-La and therefore you expect it to be in the mid part of the building with views.  It isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs on the ground floor, no views and you look at the street. It‚Äôs called bar 31 and the website doesn‚Äôt state it‚Äôs not on the 31 floor.",0
Deludente troppo rumoroso al di sotto delle aspettative,1
"Misleading, most people who came in also thought it wouldn‚Äôt be on the ground floor",0
Didn't have food. I thought bar 31:was on the 31st floor. I possibly need to read better or your marketing needs to be clearer. The whole pretence of the Shard is the views. It's not a great view from the ground floor üôÇ,1
"Very disappointed that the bar was on ground level, thought the name implied it was on the 31st floor.  This is not made obvious when booking. Terrible view on the ground.
Waiting staff were scruffy and didn‚Äôt look as if they were staff.  No table service so had to go to the bar to order; I was then given a service charge on my bill which I thought was inappropriate when the service hadn‚Äôt been great.
One positive was the drinks weren‚Äôt over priced, but overall not impressed.",1
"Myself and my friend had peach Bellini cocktails and there were awful, worst cocktail I have ever tasted",1
Wow what an evening :-) everything was as perfect as it could be with going above and beyond with the care for my pregnant daughter.  They assisted with the menu for her and even prepared a hot lemon and honey drink for her as she had a slight cough. The experience as always is great and I look forward to returning. Thank you so so much for a splendid evening.,4
"I don't write reviews but I was emailed to give on so here you go. 

The music was horrible (German weird screaming kind of horrible) and very loud. It was way too bad to ignore and killed the whole vibe. 

We politely asked the very helpful service staff if it can be changed to something, well... better. The answer we got was: ""Our manager is Austrian and he loves this stuff. We are sorry but we can't do anything about it. We had many complaints"". To be honest, I felt more sorry for the people working there because I knew we would leave soon, but they were trapped for now. 

Well, after 20 minutes we were gone, alongside 4 other groups of people, probably feeling the same way. 

Do you want to keep this place open? Maybe change the manager.",0
"Reduced food menu, reduced drinks menu, poor service and expensive",0
"Bar was pleasant but very disappointed that it was on the ground floor of The Shard. The name Bar 31 gave me the impression it was on level 31 so had 2 extremely disappointed children when we realised the best view we had was of an escalator! Not the staffs fault, as I‚Äôm sure this is not the first time this has happened.",2
Was ok. Not many people in there.  Menu very small and not much choice,2
"It‚Äôs on the ground floor not up the shard with a view!
The food was terrible and horribly overpriced",0
Lovely atmosphere and great service,4
Make it  clear you are on the ground floor. Music was very poor!,0
I was extremely disappointed because I book drinks on the 52 floor but instead I was booked at bar 31. My sisters came from South Africa and I wanted them to visit the Shard!!! I‚Äôm a regular visitor at the Shard. Stayed there a few times a year.,0
"Terrible‚Ä¶ staff were blunt and unfriendly, food was basically Wetherspoon standard but five times the price! Bowl of chips for a tenner and a tiny pork burger for 19 quid. Being called bar31 it misleads you to think you will be getting a good view out the shard but it‚Äôs actually ground floor at the bottom of t the escalator.",0
Hadn‚Äôt realised the bar was ground floor which was disappointing and was also given the impression that the whole bar was alpine themed right now.,4
"Not what I expected from the Shangri-La! The setting is absolutely average and the service was mediocre (and I‚Äôm being polite) for a 5-star flagship hotel, come on Shangri-La you can do better!!!!",0
"Quite disappointed with experience, feel we were misguided into thinking the bar would be in the shard and maybe have a view ? Instead of being on ground floor and attached to the building, had no ambience and no real wow factor ‚Ä¶",2
"Empty bar, terrible service, too few drink choices and some items out of stock or not serving. No atmosphere.",0
No Peroni but Grolsch in a Peroni glass! No no no‚Ä¶,1
"I met up with some friends for pre dinner drinks so we didn't eat here. 

The drinks menu was varied but we were celebrating so opted for a bottle of bubbly. 

The venue itself lacks a bit of atmosphere but the service was prompt & professional without being overbearing.",2
"Cool place for Pre Dinning....
You can talk easily, not so loud & noise . Good list of Beverages....And then you can continue to upper floors after 10pm.
Good Choice for Warm Up...",4
"Ground floor of shard. Sat outside which was pleasant enough, little log seating, heaters, blankets. However person who either worked there or knew workers were sat close to us smoking. Food very limited but got pizza and it was nice. Service very average, 2 pizza and two alcoholic drinks ¬£44",1
"Wasn‚Äôt  what I was expecting, slow service. We had to ask to order food they didn‚Äôt ask if we wanted it. Just got us drinks.",1
"You are deceiving. when I booked you make it seem like your on level 31. When I realized it I tried to cancel and you said you would charge us a no show pr person.
When I got there I was told that is not true and we would not have been charged 
for no show. Lady on the phone that said we would be charged was rude.",1
"Staff uninterested to provide any kind of service to guests, just point to scan and check menu online, rather to ask if we would like to order meal or site dish I‚Äôve been presented card machine to pay immediately without even check back. The top of our experience was when all the staff behind the bar dipped their finger in the bag of piping cream to try it and then just piped in some guest drink the very same cream. This can be verified if you have cctv, was around 16:45-17:00 . We just decided that hygiene in your venue was not on the level presented on your web site. and left after only a drink. No goodbye or have a nice evening from any of your staff, they‚Äôve been more interested in chatting with each other rather then to interact with any guests.",2
"Its deceiving that the bar is called Bar31 and its on the ground floor.

Our cocktails didnt taste of peach or watermelon and were the colour of watered down coca cola.

We didnt eat but the pizzas smelled great",0
Menu was limited in food choices. Calamari was frozen and not very tasty.  Pizzette was okay.,1
"Would not recommend at all. Small bar, ground level, right near an escalator and expensive!!",0
"Relaxing atmosphere, great to grab a drink and enjoy the afternoon sun ‚òÄÔ∏è",4
"average bar, really overpriced, bottom of the shard, nothing special.",2
Very nice spot for a drink and light bite. Peroni very nice and the pizzas are very nice & light from a stone oven. It's sort of pay as you go which is fine. Could do with more sauces/oils/salt & pepper when ordering food as well as cutlery/napkins (or atleast offered). Very nice for a bar to stop in and great location.,2
"We were unable to get into any of the other Shard restaurants on a busy Friday night, so booked into Bar 31. Staff were friendly and helpful, but menu very limited. Unfortunately the worse part of the whole experience was that along with the pizzas being delivered to our table so was the card machine for us to pay the bill! We hadn't even begun to eat our food, never mind finished our meal. This was not a pleasant experience and made us feel a bit like potential criminals!",1
"The menu consists of just pizza. In my estimation, an authentic pizza needs to offer capers, anchovies and as a bonus, pine nuts and sultanas. None of these were on offer.",2
Food was fine and it‚Äôs a nice place but the service was not great.,2
"Outside was noisy and dirty, service was poor, food was mediocre",2
"Not happy with the service, was approached with a card reader mid drinks and we had not finished ordering from the menu, will not be go there again",1
"Misleading advertising. Booked online thinking I would have views from the Shard but it‚Äôs on the ground floor. Drinks very expensive, nothing special",2
"The food is nice, the drink is nice and it‚Äôs handy for the hotel. However, the service in general could be better. As a resident in the hotel, you have to pre pay for food like you‚Äôre about to run off and you have to ask for further drinks or to order food nobody really checks in if you want anything else. I had to ask to spend more money! This is very much in line with the service in the hotel which is the only thing that lets it down. Otherwise I would recommend.",2
you didn‚Äôt meet our expectation. the price of the drinks are too  expensive .,0
"Overpriced and dull. We were very unimpressed. Nothing special at all, don‚Äôt bother.",1
"Firstly if you are expecting this bar to be on the 31st floor, its is not! is at the base of the shard. 

We went at 4-5pm and it was literally dead. 3 members of staff all of who were seemingly too busy with their jobs to give us much attention. 

They do not serve cocktails

General disaster :(",1
"The place is lovely, but the menu could really be expanded. The drinks list is not that great at all.",3
"My mistake, booked in a rush. Didn‚Äôt realise it wasn‚Äôt the bar at the top of the shard. When we arrived we were showed to a table outside. Sat practically under the escalator. Next to people smoking. No menu/QR code so left with no drinks for a while. Then no explanation of how to order. So we left.",0
"Fresh fab pizza that no one can complain about. 
Staff were friendly and very attentive at all times, plus you can never beat an aperol cocktail.",4
"Very disappointing experience, really limited menu, we had the worst pizza's ever, for a shocking cost. BAR 31 is on ground level, you need to change the name. Not worth a vist. The staff showed no interest.",0
Hardly the best place to experience the Shard which was why we booked in the first place.,2
"It was a very pleasant experience, however there were, regrettably, three areas of dissatisfaction. 1) my wife's Ap√©rol Spritz was delivered in a plastic glass 2) 10% service charge was automatically added to the bill and 3) I had to pay for each round of drinks at the time.",2
The name ‚ÄòBar 31 Shangri La‚Äô is quite misleading as you would expect it to be part of the hotel (31st Floor) and there were several diners that were unhappy with this and left. I specified gluten free however when I arrived I was told no gluten free options so could not eat there. Staff were friendly but overall experience disappointing,1
"Easy to book , excellent service and great atmosphere .",4
Not great!,2
"Didn't eat there only had drinks.  Wanted a table outside in a shaded area, of which there were several, (I suffer from skin cancer and cannot take the sun), but the waitress said we couldn't have one as there were only 2 of us and the tables were for 4.  So we ended up having a drink inside, almost by ourselves, where there was zero atmosphere and a TV blasting away. I later saw a waitress give a table for 4 to 2 people, which annoyed me. 
If I'd simply walked in off the street I would have walked straight back out again but as I'd pre-booked a table I was obliged to have a drink, otherwise I'd go down as a no-show and ¬£30 would have been deducted from my credit card. 
Probably one of the worst bars in London I've been to. I wouldn't go there again, neither would I recommend it to anyone, in fact the opposite.",1
"The service was slow which spoiled the whole experience. Staff aren't very attentive unfortunately.
Drinks were mediocre. Aperol served in plastic glasses - rather poor considering the prices.
Staff dressed very casually, some in jeans.
Not at all the Shangri-La experience.",2
"Booking is very deceiving, booked and paid deposits on what we thought was the bar on the 34th floor, when in fact its was bar 31 on the ground floor, sat under an elevator, explained to the reception and they couldn‚Äôt have cared any less, very very poor service, and ruined what was a birthday suprise",0
Really rubbish service. Went for a graduation and so disappointed. Also not a clever name as thought it would be in the shard. Not very clear at all,0
Limited choice on the menu but overall a great experience. Perfect if you are then going up the Shard to the viewing floors. The staff were friendly and helpful.,2
"We were seated at the Aperol Spritz pop up. We were asked to move twice in order to seat larger groups, neither of which arrived whilst we were there. The service was adequate but staff were methodical rather than friendly. Would not rush back.",2
"Great atmosphere, great value drinks especially for the location. Service was also very good",4
"So bar 31 - the name is deceiving, it‚Äôs on the ground floor. It‚Äôs right next to public toilets so smelt awful, we ordered our drinks and the waiter seemed so unsure on what we were ordering. They cost ¬£11 each the cocktails and came in plastic cups? And then the waitress wouldn‚Äôt take the service charge off, even though it was descressionary",0
"Miss sold , not in the shard , downstairs by the tube station. Nothing special, but quite nice for a few drinks",1
Enjoyable evening in the sunshine. Pizza and chips were tasty,4
"Excellent place, very enjoyable, great service. Obviously for Euro 2020 excitement is expected. Will be back again!",4
"I was a bit disappointed actually. We booked for 8.15 and waited quite a long time to be served at 8.50. The atmosphere was nice but it wasn't busy, so I was surprised service was so slow. 
It was a celebration for my daughter's 18th and the cocktail she ordered was extremely bitter to the point of unpleasant- we resolved the issue by ordering up mango juice and sharing it amongst our drinks to make them more palatable.",2
"Not very friendly service. Just a typical bar. 
Never ate. Was just there for a drink",2
"Rubbish seat, awful beer. I know it‚Äôs the shard and you expect to pay a little more, but ¬£46 for 2 small beers that tasted so bad, they were not drank and 2 x 175ml white wine is a bit steep, given this bar is on the ground floor with no view. Won‚Äôt be booking again.",2
Not worth the price. Sat next to a set of escalators.,0
Amazing atmosphere for the England football match. Staff are very helpful and good customer service. We had a lovely experience,4
"Service was very poor. Waiting staff seems they just do not want to be there. We sat out side , no one bothered come around. These waiting staff really need good customer service training. 
However, welcoming staff were good.",0
This bar took money off my credit card for not showing up when I did show up and spent over ¬£120. They have not yet refunded me.,0
"Nice place, good ambience! Booked a table in advance. 
They need to add more bites on their menu.
Overall would recommend this place.",3
Quiet and shut early. Kitchen closed. However good value and pleasent,2
"When booking, it didn‚Äôt say anywhere that the bar DOES NOT HAVE A VIEW. So when I wanted my guests to have an experience of views from the Shard, they got a view of a dodgy street on the ground level. A waste of a journey, time and money. Basic drinks. Nice pizza though.",0
"A bit disappointing really. Very expensive drinks ¬£48 for 4 Aperol Spritz, and served in plastic glasses.",1
"We had a drink and only ordered olives and s small pizza to share, but the quality of food was good.",4
We booked revel weeks in advance for a birthday celebration and then were placed under the London Bridge escalator and not in the sun. When we asked to move we were dismissed and then got neglected for service as we were shoved in a corner!,0
"We only had a pizza to share but it was nice. Good value for money for London.
Disappointed that it wasn‚Äôt actually in a the Shard on the 31st floor.",3
Disappointed as didn‚Äôt realise it was on the ground floor . Poor location and view,2
"Bad service, took half hour to bring the order, only to find they only brought us one drink not the two we ordered. My husband waited further 10 mins and then they brought him wrong drink. 
No atmosphere inside,  small table. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend.",0
"Quiet chilled vibe, polite staff. Pretty expensive for the size of the pizza and lack of cheese on top, truffle fries were great.",3
"Being part of The Shard I thought it would be an incredible experience. However I was not impressed.  First of all the noise level as your sitting under the escalator is tremendous from the air con to the The Shard building.  The pizzas I‚Äôve had better from a supermarket. So stingy on the filling. For example the Sausage one, there was about 1 cm of sausage on each slice.  The chips were very nice though.  The drinks were also good.  But service, nothing special. They were there because they have to be to bring out the food.  I spent ¬£125 on 4 Mediocre pizzas, 2 bowls of chips, 3 spritzers & a beer.  They wanted payment before we had even started to eat but as my hand was full of pizza I said they can wait until the end.  There was also a service charge on the bill.  Tried it but never again & I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone as so much better else where",2
All the staff were very friendly it‚Äôs a great place to eat or just have a drink with friends or family,4
"Really disappointing that it was on the ground floor. The waiter seemed distracted.  The food was poor quality, small portions and very average",2
Had a nice time meeting a friend - would go back.,2
"Lack of drinks‚Äô choice, we weren‚Äôt made aware that we could order drinks from another menu so had to make do with Aperol spritzes that we didn‚Äôt really enjoy. The food choices were also really limited to snacks/starters and a limited pizza menu. Overpriced & underwhelming. The service was incredibly slow considering it didn‚Äôt look that busy for a sunny BH Sunday.",0
Was really lovely day out staff are so friendly & helpful will definitely be returning x,4
All was perfect....absolutely delicious Aprol and pizza... strongly recommend..,4
Cool and trendy with a nice variety of drinks in offer.,4
Too expensive for the quality of food and overall ambience.,1
I would definitely recommend this place lovely atmosphere nice vibe for a few drinks snacks and socialising,4
"Nice bar and decent drinks, more on the pricey side but ok for Central London",3
Great time very clean and covid safe! Will definitely go back!,4
The atmosphere is nice and the services great. I am sure I'll be back,3
I was expecting a bit more b,2
A beautiful place. Food is simple and was nice but too expensive for what it was although I do understand it is the Shangri-la so it wouldn‚Äôt be cheap. Staff were lovely but should write down orders as our waiter forgot twice and had to come back and ask. Also 1 and a half hours went too quick. Would have loved to stay longer. We only had time for two drinks. Beautiful place and I would come again for sure for an Aperol Spritz or two!,3
"The bar was really nice, very efficient and friendly staff. Heaters were good too as we were outdoors (Covid). 
The music was a little unusual a mix of French, Spanish and recent hits ... which we thought was quite funny in this bar. The food was good, we only had a couple of small dishes, calamari and Parmesan fries. The beer ran out so my husband was a bit miffed. We will return as it‚Äôs beside our office!",3
"Really lovely bar and the service is outstanding, very friendly and helpful. The food really lets it down though! Perfect for after work drinks not really a dinner venue",3
"We booked the table at 21:15 but the kitchen close at 20:30 and they didn‚Äôt say anything before booking, the waiter was very kind but I had to go inside to ask them to take the order ,
I would try again .",1
Corner near the station is a bit underwhelming although the decor is cute and service is attentive. Was expecting proper glasses as opposed to plastic for ¬£11-a-pop aperol spritzs.,2
waiters got a bit shouty when i asked for mains. also charged me as i was ordering so i assume i was profiled for looking poor but rest assured my platinum AMEX card put them in their place.,1
Overall a nice lunch and drinks.,2
"Lovely vibe and friendly service, waited a bit long for the drinks but wasn‚Äôt that bad.",3
Fantastic venue at the foot of the Shard. The team were great - super friendly and helpful.,4
Great place to grab a drink & sides/pizza! Would come back,4
"Felt very rushed and we couldn‚Äôt wait to leave. It‚Äôs fine to charge people as soon as they order food or drinks but we were halfway through eating when we were interrupted and asked to pay. They were over keen to take plates and the plastic glasses away and when they asked if we wanted to order anything else, we decided not to as it wasn‚Äôt relaxing.  It was as though they didn‚Äôt want us there yet it wasn‚Äôt even busy. Everything was so rushed that it only took 40 minutes before it was over. Really annoyed that it wasn‚Äôt somewhere where we could savour a 90 minute lunch booking. 
Cutlery would have been nice- it is the Shard after all. It‚Äôs a very informal bar so probably not suitable for a lunch although food was ok if overpriced.",1
"The best pizza we had ever in London,
Staff was Nice and well behaved 

Ambience was perfect for a date with other couples around as well.

It was perfect evening

Thanks for hosting nicely",4
"A very enjoyable evening,  Great service and a good menu.  Would recommend",4
"I went here on a date and when I left my date to go to the toilet a man started to harass her. The staff were amazing, the waiter stepped in immediately and asked the man to leave and then relocated their entire table to make my date feel more comfortable. Amazing to see people so considerate and proactive, love this place and we‚Äôll be back for sure.",4
Great afternoon in the sun.,4
"Clearly sponsored by Aparol, meaning everything is Aperol. Asked for a Vodka Martini and told no but could have one of their APAROL cocktails. Wasn‚Äôt that busy and was only allowed 1 hour 30 minutes and the last 30 minutes just sat waiting to be be served. Hardly Shangrila standard!",0
Pointless and overpriced no heaters for the amount you pay what‚Äôs the point of it even being open in April?,0
Excellent service and very welcoming. They are doing a great job and very safe.,4
"We arrived at Bar 31 on time, we had to wait for 15 minutes to be seated even though we had booked 3 weeks in advance and when we were seated the table was not made up for the correct number of people. This was a special birthday for a family member and there was nothing special about it. The service was unbelievably poor and the staff were on their mobile phones while serving. We will not be returning.",0
Sehr unfreundlicher Empfang. Wir haben uns dann f√ºr ein anderes Restaurant entschieden.,0
Thought it was on 31st floor- it was under escalators of station!,0
Very disappointed at the service provided. Waited for almost 1 hr 30 and still was not provided a table for my friend‚Äôs birthday. Will not be coming back.,0
"Bottom of the shard, tables and chairs like a canteen. No ambience. Like a drop in for tired tourists who don‚Äôt want to wait in the rain for the shard. Food was good but not good to visit as a hot spot in London.",0
"I reserved a table here before a dinner in Borough for my Dad's birthday.  We booked well in advance but we were still given a table right at the back, by the toilets and the free tap water table so were surrounded by people coming and going and the football was on the screens above us - not exactly classy or ambient.  

The bar is branded by Veuve Cliquot and has all the posters, umbrellas outside etc., so I ordered a bottle of champagne, which cost ¬£65 (a lot of money to me) and was served warm (opened and poured before I could protest).  It had not been on ice at all and was undrinkable, the staff member poured enormous glasses for us knowing that it was warm and then put the bottle on ice and left it with us, we had to try and pour it back in the bottle and wait for it to cool.  30 mins later and it was still nowhere near cold enough but we had to drink it and rush off.  The staff member seemed confused when we complained and just put more ice in the ice bucket.  For ¬£65 and at a location such as the Shard, I expect better service and staff knowledge, e.g. a friend paid a similar price for a bottle of champagne for us at The Ned the previous Friday and it was served ice cold, in pre-frosted crystal glasses and I was invited to taste before it was poured.  Not to sound like a snob - I rarely buy champagne but happened to be celebrating twice - but it is not unreasonable to expect that staff know how to serve drinks and communicate with you if there are any issues with what you have ordered.  Don't bother going - I won't be returning.",0
Great bar but the live music was very loud so prevented ease of having a conversation. Self service bar ordering and paying is good however you should not be charging service charge on top when you‚Äôve had to get everything yourself!,3
Good for a casual drink and snacks after work. Wine and aperol spritz were good.,2
"Good place to meet, but I‚Äôd probably have one drink and move on",2
The website showed a picture of a great view high up in the Shard. Bar 31 is on the first floor...very disappointing and simply a shameful/deceiving way to attract customers.,0
"We went there, because on the menu online you can read a few of vegetarian meals, but those are only served untill 3 pm.  I asked for some vegetarian tapas and they responded with ""olives"". We left the place,  so sorry for that. In addition, online you see the bar is located at the 31t floor, but you find on the ground floor.",1
"Falsely advertised, it‚Äôs actually on the ground floor of the shard with no view. Stayed for a drink, tables were dirty and a limited selection of drinks definitely not worthy. Front of house staff very nice and managed to get us a last minute table at Gong on the 53rd floor, great service and views would highly recommend booking a table there.",0
"Complete disappointment. Had booked it because I thought it was on a high floor at the Shard. In fact it is ground floor, furthermore it looks like a glorified Starbucks. Did not bother to actually sit there",0
"A couple of glasses of champagne in the sunshine whilst catching up with a friend is always a good way to start an evening. 

The only suggestion I‚Äôd give is that if someone asks the guy outside if they can order from him, rather than saying no, say it‚Äôs champagne only as if would have saved me queuing up after asking. 

The guy on the guitar was great and a lovely addition.",4
"Arrived at Bar 31 expecting a nice romanic date with my partner only to find the football was playing, un-engaging staff, and a cue to order food which is something I did not expect. Not a great atmosphere, so decided to go to one of the restaurants on level 32.",0
"Staff was amazing and very accommodating.  Had drinks and light bites  there while waiting to be seated at the G≈éNG (which was a different level of pretentious) and food was super tasty. Cool, chill ambiance. Not much of a view but we caught a few last  tunes from a live performance - lovely time!",4
Was closed the date you confirmed a table reservation for me. The staff at the shard managed to get us a table at the Gong bar instead because we travelled down from Yorkshire. So overall dissapointed with your booking for a bar that is closed on Mondays!,0
"After accidentally booking Bar 31 instead of the Gong, the service was incredible as explained my mistake and they called through to the Gong Bar to change our reservation after trying to rebook online with no luck.  I had a lovely beverage whilst waiting for our reservation to be changed. All the staff we encountered were so helpful and accommodating. 

Lovely little cafe on the ground floor and a good meeting place to catch up.",4
"Went for dinner last night before a concert at Rogers centre. Had a reservation and yet there were no tables available- ok, this happens, we were happy to wait, but they were taking walk-ins and not honouring reservation times!
We sat at the bar to wait, ordered 2 drinks- 1 arrived, the other came over half an hour later- no wait staff came near us. We eventually got a table over 30 mins after our reservation time- then had to chase down our food (which we‚Äôd ordered whilst waiting at the bar!). Once we got the pizzas, they were good but not worth the hassle.",0
Even with reservations we were still waiting outside for 30 minutes. Service was terrible. Got drinks wrong. Food took one hour. DO NOT go here pre concert.,0
Very busy.  Waited quite a while for drinks and food.  Pasta and pizza were good but difficult if you‚Äôre in a hurry for an event.,2
"Delicious food, lots of options.  Venue isn‚Äôt large so probably best to call ahead on game or concert nights if you need a table larger than 5.",4
Worst food and service I‚Äôve ever had.  Save your money and don‚Äôt eat here.  They couldn‚Äôt even make basic cocktails correctly.,0
"I read the other reviews, but since we were here last year, I thought we'd try again anyway. I ditto the other comments about the menu. They have 1 hard copy, but some of the items aren't available at this location. So we scanned the QR code for their menu. When our server, who was great, brought our water, she said they have no chicken, and no beer. What? How can you operate the restaurant lacking such essential supplies? Go down the block to the Shoppers Drug Mart and get some chicken! Anyway, 40 hours after our reservation date and time, I received an email from Open Table - Pizza Rustica had cancelled our reservation! I was able to get into an online chat with Open Table, and Olga was very helpful in adding the reservation back in. Yes, I did mention to the server that I had booked through Open Table. I hadn't even had a chance to leave a review before the restaurant cancelled my reservation. Never going there again. I recommend they turn this restaurant into a Timmies or Starbucks, it would be a lot better use of space.",0
"Went to the metro convention center for a conference with 7 colleagues and chose this lunch spot because of their prices and gluten free options. When we arrived, no one else was in the restaurant and all of us were sat quickly. There was only a QR code for the menu but it requests all your contact details before you can access it so we ordered based off the menu on their website while others used the open table menu. Unfortunately they did not have any gluten free options besides salad, so that was disappointing for one party member. It seems to be a common theme in the comments where they're running out of common items so whoever does their ordering might need to revisit their planning skills. The food took a while despite there only being one other couple who arrived after we ordered but it tasted good when we got it. When the bill came, we were shocked that the prices were higher than expected. At least $2 per item more than the  website menu and DOUBLE the open table menu. Rather than honouring the price posted on their website, they said we should have used the QR code, despite it being inaccessible without submitting your personal contact info. They said they would speak with the owner and let him know but that was not helpful in the moment and showed the owner perhaps hasn't trained or empowered his employees to problem solve. We were already late for the afternoon part of the conference so left. Two days later I got a cancellation notification from the restaurant on opentable. Luckily I took a picture of my receipt and their fantastic customer experience representative reinstated the reservation and gave me my 100 points. All of us will not be returning which is unfortunate because the food was good but everything else was a chaotic mess and/ or misleading.",0
"The restaurant was extremely busy when we arrived. They seem to take more reservations than they are able to accommodate. Server seemed irritated with the high volume of people coming in and overwhelmed. We waited 20 minutes for drinks and water as they claimed they did not have enough glassware? However, people seated inside the restaurant, who arrived after us hat nice glasses of ice water. Food was decent and the server seemed to get friendlier as the meal went on, and the restaurant less busy not sure we would go back",2
"Our reservation was at 5pm on a Friday night and they didn‚Äôt have bread, milk, limes and a number of other items so many things we asked for we could not have. 

The pizza we ordered was good. Service was excellent. We felt bad for our waiter because he kept having to tell us we couldn‚Äôt have what we asked for.",0
This place is tired! Went there before a show on a Saturday and was told they have no beer‚Ä¶..none at all of any kind! Excuse me? The pizza was pretty good as was the bruschetta. The waiter was decent but his shirt was all worn and ripped up on the sleeve. No it wasn‚Äôt a fashion statement. So wear a clean black T-shirt!,0
"Plates were dirty on the table and the table hadn't been wiped down. We all got beer just out of the bottle I wished I had for a beer glass since I add lime to my beer I had to use the cup the limes came in. 

Pizza was delicious tho",2
A group from work came here for lunch. Hard to find a restaurant that easily blends vegetarian and meat options. There were multiple choices for both. Service was friendly. We all enjoyed it and agreed we would return. The patio in summer would be great.,4
"We were downtown for a show and went for dinner. The BBC service, food and location were perfect. Will visit there again.",4
"Girls weekend. Had been with my family once before and it was amazing. This time around, it was not the best. The service was terrible and two dishes of the 4 were cold and food did not taste good. I will not be back.",2
"I ordered the seafood pasta which only had shrimp and calamari. The restaurant didn't have mussels, chicken and espresso, since their espresso machine was broken. Service was slow, with only one server.",2
"The food at this restaurant was delicious, and although the restaurant was not big, they still easily accommodated our group of 10, and didn‚Äôt make any fuss about separating bills. I would definitely come back here again.",4
Undercooked pasta and the worst chicken ceasar salad I‚Äôve ever had.  Save your money!,0
"The food was mediocre and took over an hour to come, despite the restaurant not being overly busy.",1
"We were disappointed that the menu on Open Table is not the menu that is currently in use at the restaurant. In particular, none of the vegan options such as the veggie pizzas with Daiya cheese and the vegan taco salad are on the menu. Link to actual menu : https://pizzarustica.ca/assets/menu/PRMENU2022_D5.pdf

For a vegan option, we ordered the veggie calzone with no cheese, which was dry without the cheese. Would suggest the addition of some sauce to replace the cheese.

Did not appreciate that the Open Table reservation was not marked as honoured and we had to contact Open Table to obtain the points and to ensure we were eligible to post this review.

Server was pleasant, friendly and efficient. But only two servers before a Jays game was insufficient. 

Restroom facilities could have use some work before the rush. Clean but supplies (paper, towels, soap) were almost out, not in their proper holders and would not have lasted the dinner hour.",1
"As much as we were looking forward to this preshow dinner, that‚Äôs how much it was a disappointment. The service was nonexistent, you are forgotten about very quickly half our food was delivered, and the other two people at our table never saw food, even though we asked the waitress several times to follow up. Such a disappointment .
Definitely a non-recommendation",1
"First of all, I made my reservation for 7 people weeks in advance, when I got there they didn‚Äôt have a table for us. Thankfully two of our guests cancelled so we squeezed into a small table. There is no AC so it was incredibly hot and uncomfortable.  They didn‚Äôt have any glasses left so we weren‚Äôt able to order any water either ice. They did provide room temperature bottled water . When the glasses finally did become available, I had to ask our server to get some for us because I could see they were running out again. We ordered some appetizers, the server didn‚Äôt bring any side plates for a table of 5 people‚Ä¶.so of course I had to ask for some and of course they never came. Not once did our server apologize for any of the mishaps. I will not be going back",1
"Food was fantastic! Service was poor. Had to ask other servers for cutlery and more water. Our server never had a smile on her face and looked fed up with her job. Left as soon as we paid, not a great experience.",2
"Server was kind and pleasant. Pizzas weren‚Äôt great, dough was tough, edges burnt. Things were slow. Bathrooms were dirty. Wraps were good and drinks were good! It‚Äôs pricey for what it is. Overall not super impressed, the ambiance wasn‚Äôt great, things just felt a little grimy but it was late and a last minute option. Might be better during regular hours.",2
Unfortunately the place was very dirty and super hot. Was a bad experience. Nothing like the advertisement video.,0
Best suited to serve take-out Pizza.  Pizza was the only edible food that was served and the service was the worst I have had in over 20 years.,0
Had a reservation for Saturday Aug 27th and they didn‚Äôt even save a table for us.  Will never recommend this place anyone and will never go back.  Very poorly ran.  Completely disgusted with them,0
Food was great. Service was awful. Waiter forgot our garlic bread. My husband asked for a beer. Never arrived.,2
"Doug, our server was great. As busy as it became after the Blue Jays game, whenever he came to our table he came with a smile. The food was yummy, and the Pinot went down too fast! A new favourite whenever we come down for a Jays game!",4
"Food was great; service very slow.  Manager did come to table several times to apologize.  As with many restaurants currently, they are understaffed.  Waitress asked us to pay before our food had arrived (we‚Äôd been waiting an hour) which was kinda weird.",2
"What service?  Made a reservation at Jon for 5:20 and NO ONE seven attended to us. We were told to seat ourselves. 
No chilled drinks and horrible staff that neglected everyone. Those sitting there prior to us were complaint. 
We had to leave otherwise we would not have made the concert we were attending.",0
"The tables, patio and bar in the restaurant were covered in dirty dishes the entire time we were in the restaurant. The staff made no attempt to tidy things. I can appreciate being understaffed but this very unappetizing to see and the staff seemed to be wandering around aimlessly. Food was okay but would not return.
Also find it a bit strange that a staff member decided to go into their car which was parked at the front of the restaurant and change their shirt several times in front of the patio guests.",0
The pizzas were delicious but the service and ambience of the restaurant needs serious improvement. The cleanliness also was not as it should be..whoever us running this place needs to take these issues seriously and prioritise as they are equally if not more important the food.,1
"I was very disappointed by this meal. Warm beer, terrible pizza that was overpriced, not a nice ambiance at all. Server was friendly but didn‚Äôt know what drinks they had available. Sprayed neighbouring tables with lysol while we were eating which wafted over and we had to breathe in. Yuck. Would never return.",1
"Good, service and overall experience was awful. Flies everywhere.",0
Friendly staff.  Good food. Great location near rogers centre.,4
We showed up for our reservation of 12 on Saturday at 7 PM. There were no tables available besides a table of 4. The girls face when I told her our group amount and the reso time was pure shock. She said she would look into it then proceeded to walk away and continue on with her day‚Ä¶ she didn‚Äôt come back for an update. Another group showed up at the same time with 8 people. We kind of laughed together saying there‚Äôs zero chance they can fit everyone. There were 2 people working for a full restaurant and I heard a lot of apologies being made to tables while waiting for our reso. This wasn‚Äôt a good sign so we decided to leave. We planned our evening around this and had 4 kids with us. We then had to find somewhere else to go which at 7 on a Saturday of a jays game is very hard.  Very frustrating. Please manage your reservations more properly.,0
Food was ok service was horrible.  Half the staff were smoking outside my window while one waitress was barely keeping up with 3 tables.  Received our food and then extra plates were wet.  Considering how Un-busy the place was it should have been way better,1
"Our server (Kelly) was horrible.  Her attitude towards the entire party was disgusting.  She was only nice to us when it was ""Tip Time"".  She seemed bothered the entire night .  I get people have bad days but to the experince a horrible one was uncalled for.  I booked a party for 10 for a 40th bday party ....people came from out of town.  It was embarrassing and I will definately be writing a google review on this.  HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!",0
Too cold inside,1
"I made a reservation thinking that the patio would be open due to no indoor dining because there were reservations available to be made. Google also said they were open, but they weren‚Äôt. When I got there I thought that I may have gone to the wrong location but I was at the right one. I called and the voicemail also directed me to making a reservation online. Really upset that I went all the way there for it not to be open for even takeout.",0
They were late opening so we actually thought they had closed - the server started off busier with setting up and catching up - it appeared she didn‚Äôt know we had a booking for noon and therefore wasn‚Äôt rushing. After a disappointing start service improved and ended on a good note.,3
Great pizza and excellent service,4
"nice waitress,
understaffed,
lots of flies, 
probably better as a takeout restaurant",1
"Food was fine, but the service was absolutely terrible. We practically had to beg to be seated or have our order taken despite the place being empty and multiple staff lounging around. Would not return or recommend to others. None of the staff wore their masks properly, or checked vaccine cards. 0/10 is my actual rating.",0
"I had massage therapy nearby Rustica this morning and since I had a craving for pizza, I booked at this place, which I had dined at before, pre-pandemic. I booked for noon. I get there at quarter to, doors are locked. No one is inside, lights are out except for mandatory security lights, as in most shops. I am thinking perhaps they open right at noon? So I wait until noon. No one comes, same situation. I try to see if there is another entrance. Zero. Zilch. Nada. What's weird is that both on their website and at the door, it says open 24 hours. What the hell ? I went to Earl's instead where I had..... chicken wings! If a place is closed due to Emergency, at least, put a sign in the door! I called the number on the website. Voicemail, box full, can't leave a message.... Don't waste your time! Go elsewhere.",0
"Pics on webpage and google are deceiving. Place is more like a take out stall than a restaurant and bar. Food was very bad. Calamari felt like chewing on rubber tire. Got 7 morsel size shrimp, smaller than going to Popeyes. Pizza was nothing special.",0
Great food,4
I felt Portion wasn‚Äôt good,2
Service was slow despite the restaurant not being busy.  Apparently they only had one corkscrew and it was broken.  They had to get that and a bottle of wine from their partner restaurant around the corner.,2
Restaurant was closed on arrival at time of reservation. No contact was made or attempted to notify me prior to arrival.,0
The food was bless! Say no more! üí≥‚ô®Ô∏èü•É,3
Was a great dinner. Food was excellent,3
Waitress said our table was double booked,0
"To be honest I was a little disappointed. I only came because I read that there was vegan cheese. And when I arrived and ready to order I was told there was no vegan cheese that night. I ate pasta that was way overpriced for what was in it, and portion size.",2
"Great food and service, could use some music",4
"Really bad experience.  Used to be a great place not long ago - it‚Äôs changed ALOT, don‚Äôt bother and hit up another place.",0
"The food was absolutely trash, store pizza is better. So disappointing and i don't understand the reviews on Google.",0
"What once was a restaurant that used quality ingredients and baked delicious pizza in a stove oven has been replaced by a very sorry excuse for Italian fare. Too many choices in Toronto - trust me, avoid this one.",0
"The food was horrible and the place was unpleasant overall. For starters, our table was not wiped down or cleaned -  which is even worse given we‚Äôre in the midst of the Covid outbreak. Overall I have no idea why this place has such good reviews. It‚Äôs horrible. 

Our waitress was also very awkward and seated us under some heater sticking out of the wall outside, so my boyfriends neck was literally squished and we were just overall very uncomfortable and unimpressed. 

The only redeeming quality about this place is that it‚Äôs open 24/7 so it‚Äôs I guess convenient for people who want something to eat after going out drinking.",0
The food tasted great. Loved the calamari. The staff was very helpful and courteous.,3
Food was good but service was slow. Understaffed crew,2
We've visited Pizza Rustica at Blue Jays Way on several occasions and have always been impressed.  We'll be back!,4
"Great, friendly service. The pizzas were delicious (we had the Calabrese and sicilian) Our friend loved his Ceasar salad.     Theatre district was very close by. Bright and airy with large screen TVs playing sports. The only complaint would be that the background music was a little loud but I would highly recommend it.",4
"Super restaurants, on a ador√© nos pizza c‚Äôest une adresse qu‚Äôon va garder pour une prochaine fois. Super frais, qualit√© / prix au top",4
The food was mediocre. My friend‚Äôs pizza was soggy in the middle and burnt on the edges. My pasta was flavoured well but the pasta itself tasted like pasta you buy in a box from the grocery store. Place was beautiful though and good service.,1
"They were short staff, we had to wait for move than one hour for food. Some folks had to leave without eating. 
The food was really good, just a tat too salty.",2
"My friends and I chose this restaurant because it came up as having vegan options and was accommodating of allergies. When we got there after making our OpenTable reservation, the table was not ready and cleared for us and we had to wait for them to get that ready for us ‚Äî which should have been the first red flag.

We asked the server about their vegan options and whether they can prevent cross-contamination with nuts. They advertised vegan cheese on their menu and that their pizzas can be made vegan. The server came back and told us that the kitchen is out of vegan cheese and that they can't guarantee that there's no cross-contamination. The server offered us salad ‚Äî which is just about the last thing anyone wants when they're trying to order a pizza. So we left.

There are some terrible reviews of this place online but I decided to take a chance on it. Unfortunately, this was one of the cases where the reviews were true.  There were also a few reviews that said that the kitchen was out of vegan cheese, so this wasn't an isolated incident. I suspect that the kitchen never had vegan cheese to begin with. They shouldn't be advertising this on their menu if they don't have it. Their website is completely broken so we didn't have a way of verifying the menu beforehand.

In a city with no shortage of great pizza spots, and ones that can do way more to ensure they can accommodate dietary restrictions. Do not recommend.",0
"We waited over an hour to get our orders and the spot we sat at was so cold. 
Not to blame any of the staffs but I think it was poorly managed.",0
Way too expensive for very mediocre food.  I wouldn‚Äôt go again,0
"Severely understaffed during last Wednesday lunch. One server desperately tried to keep up with dine in and take out. When I  suggested he should let guests know as they come that the kitchen is hopelessly backed up, it didn‚Äôt seem to register; he kept saying he prioritized my order and that‚Äôs the the best he could do. Net, despite making reservation I had to leave with my pizza in a box after waiting one hour. It was doubly disappointing because I took my son and his friend as they were visiting for ‚Äòtake your kids to work‚Äô day, and it turned out this way. Left a 20% tip for the server because he was working so so hard. Management need to either staff up or give the server authority to potentially refuse business or at least be able to inform clients of long wait time. Server seemed afraid to so that.",0
"Food was excellent. Each dish came piping hot - daily soup fresh , hot and very tasty. Lasagna very good. Pizza was crisp and very good.",3
"Our waiter/host, Doug, was the highlight of the evening. It was amazing watching him command the room and handle the sudden crowd of tables that came and went while we were dining. He was personable and informative throughout the entire experience. 
Our food was amazing as well. We dined on several different pastas and pizzas that the entire table shared. I was with friends from out of town and they were very impressed with the quality of each dish and at reasonable prices. 
This place is a must for your casual dining.",4
"Great pizza, nice pasta, cute place. What else do you need?",3
The menu on the website once you booked through OpenTable is incorrect. They changed the menu from the last time I was there and the food was dry and over cooked. The service was good but that was about it.,2
"Great food and great service as usual. However, is was unusually warm inside.",4
"Made a reservation for 9ppl and when we showed up the table wasn‚Äôt ready and it seemed no one was even aware of the reservation. Server was friendly but service was SLOW.  No water was brought to the table, all beer taps are apparently non-functional though there are several draft beers listed on the menu. The server opened our bottle of red, then proceeded to re-cork it and put it back on the table. Didn‚Äôt pour it at all, and also with a red normally you leave it open to breathe? Odd. Especially for an Italian place. We pulled out the cork and poured it ourselves. Other non-alcoholic drinks were brought in cans which we also opened and poured ourselves. Not a huge deal, except when you‚Äôre charged an automatic gratuity for a large party (which we were), it might have been nice for the server to take care of this. Food was good and hot, but took forever to come out of the kitchen and meals were so staggered that two in our party had not even received their meals yet when others were finished. Very convenient location and food was good but not sure I‚Äôd go back due to service issues.",1
Great food and great ambiance. Had a lovely family birthday dinner.,4
"Great location near Blue Jays, with parking across the street and a caf√© table with an awning on the street, all good including the wine, pizza, salad and dessert.",3
Need to do something with the flies.  Too many buzzing around especially when we are eating!,3
Quiet Sunday evening - pizza was delicious as was the Italian wine. Tiramisu was best yet in Toronto! We had a great waiter called Jason who loves his customers- hope the boss appreciates what a gem he is !,4
"Food was OK but service very slow even though it was not busy when we went. Had to ask twice for the bill, no one ever comes around to refill water glass.",2
They did not honor our reservation and it would have been nice to receive a cancellation notification by either the restaurant or open table. Poor service!,0
They did not even keep my table reservation I ended up not even being seated. Rude staff terrible customer service,0
"They did not even take my open table reservation into consideration. The Raptors playoff game was on so they were busier than usual, however, they refused to honour the reservation I made because of it. I had a horrible experience and was really frustrated the entire time. They should not be on this app if they can‚Äôt deliver on a simple expectation that is to have a table at my reservation time.",0
Our server was nice enough but the food was terrible. I ordered the pear Gorgonzola salad which was terrible and my boyfriend ordered a Caesar wrap that was just lettuce and Caesar dressing in a wrap... we both couldn‚Äôt finish our food and we told the server we didn‚Äôt enjoy it. Nothing was taken off our bill. Food is too expensive for the quality it is. Will not be returning and will not recommend.,2
Absolute worst service I have ever had in this city. The server was very rude and wouldn‚Äôt accommodate me when I accidentally ordered the wrong thing on the menu. He refused to let me switch my order and we had to pay for food that we didn‚Äôt eat. I asked to speak to a manger and the manager didn‚Äôt take the time to speak to me. I have never come across customer service as poor as this and I promise to never go back.,0
"We had a fine waiter and the food was great. Nice, clean, big washrooms are always a plus!",3
"The food was ok and that‚Äòs the best thing about the location. I ordered a tap-beer from the menu and got the answer ‚Äûsorry we haven‚Äòt that one‚Äú so i ordered another brand, from the tap as well and got a bottle. Period. 
I asked the waitress why i didn‚Äòt get it from the tap and she told me again, it wasn‚Äòt available, so i asked for a glas. She then brought me one ( not the cleanest specimen ) followed by another bottle. She told me, i could use the second bottle to fill the glas to the brim and she would only charge me the price of a tap-beer. As for other things not available, my wife asked for an orange-juice - sorry,  an apple-juice - sorry, only cranberry available. 
It was the most underwhelming diner experance i‚Äòve had in a long while. 
No recommendation.",1
Everything was great. The only downfall was the many flies !!  If you can do something about the flies it would be perfect!!,3
Used to be much more of a Pizzeria with specialty pizzas like ‚ÄúButter Chicken‚Äù and ‚ÄúChicken Tikka‚Äù etc.  Now it‚Äôs a 24 hour spot with a lot of pasta and other things. Much more generic and less specialized.,1
"Food and service great. Tight quarters. We were a party of 8 and felt like we were in everyone‚Äôs way. Waitress, other patrons etc....",3
"Made reservations for a busy Friday night. We were seated right away, the pizza and calamari was great.",2
"We had a reservation at 5:30pm, however we were not even looked at by a staff member until 6pm, and then seated at 6:15pm. Even after we sat down, the manager was quite rude, asking us if we had ordered yet, and if the waiter had put through our order. I understand they were busy, but they clearly accepted many early walk-ins, and then were unable to accommodate people with reservations. Disappointing.",2
Had a reservation for 3 people for 5:15pm and didn‚Äôt get sitted until after 5:30pm. I was put on a small table that was for 2 person with an extra chair as it was ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù. My back was touching the next table which had the same issue. Ordered 2 pizzas and 3 drinks. Drinks came right away but pizzas took a very long time. We had finished our drinks already when the pizza came. Too crowded and not enough organization especially knowing that was a concert happening at the Rogers center at 7pm.,1
"I would not recommend this restaurant.  The Manager or Owner of the restaurant berated our waitress in front of not only her colleagues but also customers. My daughter and I walked out after ordering our drinks.    His voice was getting louder the angrier he became. His complaint was that she was being late for her shifts, which I agree is a problem, however, he should have had the conversation with her in private. This behaviour is not only inappropriate but also  unprofessional in this setting. We left because  if this is how he treats employees who knows how he would treat customers. The waitress was very upset and I told the Manager or Owner that my daughter and I did not want to hear him yelling.  He waved me off and did not engage in conversation.",0
Ice people and good food Thanks,3
"Went to Pizza Rustica for a pre-concert meal with friends. The food was great as well as the bucket of beer! The pizzas were delish, especially the Margerita, and the Chicken Alfredo was overflowing with chicken. Reasonable prices and great service!",3
Really great food but the street front patio can get a bit noisy - probably a better experience inside,4
"The food and service here was excellent. There are a great deal of options for vegetarians, eating gluten free, and meat lovers. The only draw back was the amount of water on the floor of the women‚Äôs bathroom. I suspect there are problems due to flooding in Toronto and that issues will be resolved at some point.",3
Everything was great except it was very loud due to the nearby construction,3
The food was really good and flavorful. I had the braised f ravioli which was quite tasty. My wife had the lasagna and thought it was decent. My daughter had the chicken Alfredo which she thought was delicious and full of flavor.,3
"I‚Äôd love to share how the pizza was, but I can‚Äôt, since my party and I never got seated, even after confirming our reservation twice (once online, once over the phone). 

We showed up to see many groups waiting outdoors. I went in the to tell the hostess we had a reservation and she cut me off mid-sentence to tell me and my group to clear out the entrance of the restaurant. Then, she left and didn‚Äôt come back, so I had to tell her again that we had a reservation. I was ignored, as in she just didn‚Äôt respond to my question, ignored me and continued to rush around the restaurant.  

So Pizza Rustica does not honor reservations, apparently. Was the restaurant crowded? You betcha. But did I have a reservation that I confirmed? Yes. Unfortunately, the reservation meant nothing. Another friend in my party politely asked again if the hostess could give us an estimate of when we might be seated, and was treated the same rude way. The hostess snapped in an extremely rude manner and said, ‚ÄúSeriously, there‚Äôs a lot of groups before you who also have reservations. So you‚Äôre going to have to wait.‚Äù

So, we left. And will never return. And will never recommend. Pizza Rustica, please don‚Äôt take reservations if you‚Äôre not going to honor them. And though your hostess was clearly distressed and annoyed at me and others politely asking about our reservations, it‚Äôs not an excuse to be blatantly rude. She ruined the experience overall.",0
We made a reservation through Open Table only to arrive at the restaurant where they told us they didn't have any table for us nor the 15 other people standing outside in line with reservations. Don't book with them if you want to guarantee a table!,0
"We had reservations at 5:15, half an hour later and we were still waiting.  They overbooked and had no idea how to manage the overbooked restaurant.  Just horrible management.",0
"We had a reservation we made through opentable. We had other people want to join us and the app wouldn't allow us to add. I called and added over the phone. I also called the morning of to make sure the change had been made.  All was confirmed.  Arrived to be told they only had the original reservation and couldnt accommodate us.  The Manager ""Mike"" was the rudest person I've ever met and told us to learn how to use the app and wouldnt listen when we tried to explain that we had called the change in. He then told us go elsewhere and waved us off with his hand. It should be noted that I had also emailed through the app so I had written confirmation of the change.",0
"Reservation was made and confirmed on both open table and with a phone call yet the restaurant  still did not reserve a table for us. We saw this happen to three groups while we were there. Eventually a table was provided but late, our group had to be separated into two and they were unapologetic about their error. Don‚Äôt rely on a reservation if you have somewhere to be after your meal.",0
Unfortunately they were booked solid and running behind due to a concert. Waited 30 mins after our reservation time for a table and the the food took an hour to arrive after ordering. They staff were very friendly and trying really hard to help.,2
Very poor customer service. Very rude to customers. Does not hold table for customers who are stuck in traffic and will be there in 5 mins. So did not really get to eat the food and will most likely not make a reservation again cause they have no leeway with people who are stuck in traffic and are on the street where the restaurant is on.,0
Food was good but despite a reservation we were seated an hour late. Servers are sparse and overworked. No air conditioning so is quite hot inside on a hot day.   Cramped seating.,2
"The reviews on here are pretty accurate - food is good, service is terrible",1
Worst Open Table experience ever.  Service was beyond poor. White wine warm. Server refused to pour wine. Had to ask for bottle to be chilled. Food mediocre. Server brought main course 5 minutes after salads and when asked about that just said sorry but jammed the mains onto the table.  Open Table should not associate its good brand with this place.,0
"Food was fantastic! 

Our waiter was not very attentive. The manager actually checked in on us more frequently. The food came out fast so getting to our concert on time was not an issue. 
Seemed to be out of important things....like beer!

But like I said, wold def go back for the food!",3
"The pizza was very tasty. However when it was time for the bill, it came to $78 Ca which was pretty high for 3 small pizzas. Ok, we‚Äôre on vacation, whatever. We asked if we could pay in US dollars and the waitress said she would ask. She came back and said yes but it‚Äôs the same amount of money. I said no way, it‚Äôs .76/$1 exchange rate that day. So we paid w/ a credit card. A little shady.",2
"This used to be a favourite spot. This time, the waitress brought two entrees to our table of three and said, ""Oh, were there three entrees?"" Um, hello, yes there were. She had forgotten to submit my order and I was left waiting while the others were eating. No apology for that mix-up. Also, no offer of coffee or dessert at the end of the meal. Food was OK, if a bit overpriced. Calamari had no real flavour, other than the breading and dips it came with. Beef ravioli were good. As were the cheese tortellini in Alfredo sauce. Calzone was a little too much dough, but otherwise good. The restaurant is way too cramped. We were seated by the window, but when we got up to leave, realized there was no clear way out, without making everyone move their chairs. Guess this was why I could make a last-minuted Friday night reservation, when I couldn't at most other restaurants.",1
"It took a while before anyone came to our table but once they did we didn't have to wait too long.  Pizza was good, very cheesy though.",2
Pizza was bland.  No flavour.  Calamari was bland and overcooked.,2
"Not sure if this place is affiliated with one in Ottawa, but post ballgame it was a good spot to get some great pizza a short walk from the ballpark. It was a bit hectic in there, but we were seated and waited on in short order and our food arrived promptly. Nice thin crust pizzas, fresh salads and decent wine, made for a good and reasonably priced meal. Not sure when next we will be in Toronto, but would visit here again.",2
We made a reservation on open table on Saturday for that evening (April 28th) and we got to the restaurant they would not honor our reservation. The reason : the Blue Jays had a game that afternoon.... üò≥ you are on open table or not.... not when it‚Äôs convenient for you. It was then almost 8 with all this on a Saturday trying to find a place. Very unprofessional,0
"Fantastic food as usual and they will modify ingredients to suit your diet/allergies. I‚Äôve been here many times and will keep returning. Great staff too.  Renovated inside, looks very nice.
Great place before the Jays game!",4
"The group enjoyed it and the food, though they were a bit disconcerted when they first arrived and were told that the restaurant didn‚Äôt have the reservation.",3
Always a pleasure dining at Pizza Rustica! The food is amazing and the service is great. It‚Äôs one of my favourite pizza spots in the city!,4
We all enjoyed the food and the large portion size. Very impressed.,4
Great atmosphere and perfect location for post-game dinner.,3
"This restaurant needs to learn how to manage their reservations better.  Made a reservation prior to a Jays game but staff was unable to get other patrons who'd been there for hours to leave, thus opening up tables for those of us with reservations.  We left without eating.  Maybe they shouldn't accept reservations for game day.  Also host was arrogant and rude.",0
"We hadn't been to this restaurant in a while, but made a reservation for after the Blue Jays baseball game.  Very convenient location.  Glad we made a reservation -- when the game was over, the place filled up quickly with fans.  Shared a ""create-your-own"" pizza & meat lasagna.  Both were very tasty and enough to share, for 2 people.",3
"Had a group of 20 (instant 18% gratuity) so service was non-existent. I had to pour everyone water, get the menus myself, and once when I made eye contact with the manager and beckoned him over, he completely ignored me. The worst service I‚Äôve ever experienced.",1
Been coming here for years. Best thin crust pizza in the City.,4
"Food was great and our server was great but the ambience was a bit uncomfortable- it seemed like several staff members were fighting amongst themselves openly in the front of the restaurant, which was distracting and awkward",3
"The food and service from the staff was great. Towards the end of our dinner, the manager came in and started to yell and swear at his staff. It was very inappropriate to do that in front of customers. It also made me and my friend feel uncomfortable. We really wanted to leave once he started.  The experience and service before the manager arrived was excellent. I want the manager to know that his team is doing a good job and if you need to discipline them, please do it in private so the customers in the restaurant does not have to hear or see. Thanks.",2
"Had a wonderful pre concert meal prior togoing to Glen Gould Theatre. Started of with glass of syrah & the mushroom salad to share, it was wonderful a big bowl but gone in no time. My husband had the jambalaya fettuccini & i had the   vegetable lasagna which came piping hot nice large portions. I then had a cappuccino & my husband had hot tea both came nice & hot a perfect ending to our meal. We got to the concert in time. Service was good.",4
"Terrible service, table not ready for 15 minutes even with reservation, food quality poor. Will not return.",0
"Have a great pizza and pasta and price is good!
The service is very good and the atmosphere pleasant.",4
We had heard good things about Pizza Rustica but weren‚Äôt really impressed. My wife ordered a soup that never showed up; the sauce for the pasta tasted like it was something out of a can; and the panzerotto wasn‚Äôt overly tasty. Recommendation to avoid.,2
"Made a reservation for supper with The kids following Disney On Ice.  There were a few other families with the same idea.  The food came out quickly and they were quite attentive to my children despite not necessarily being a ""family"" restaurant.",3
"Food was pretty good but the service was slow. There were only 3 active tables and the server was very inattentive. 2/3 of the tables had young children <10 years old and the server had no idea how to speak to children. She referred to my daughter as ‚Äúthe child‚Äù 

I ordered a Diet Coke and was provided a dirty cup and the server was not really understanding that a clean cup was required. 

Just overall bad attitude by the wait staff",2
We were three adults and 4 children after a matinee show. The food was good and service attentive and friendly.,3
"Pizza Rustica was very accommodating of our group which I appreciated.  The pizzas were good, lots of variety, and no issues with substitutions.",4
"Pleasantly surprised, wasn't expecting much when we walked in but server attentive, not overbearing. Tried the calamari to nibble on, not greasy, nice and light and we both had pasta. Both pretty good. Would definitely pop back before a show again, might try the pizzas as their takeout business booming and they looked good.",3
"This was a delightful experience.  We were going to a concert , and thought this is not far from ACC, 5 min Uber drive. They have vegan options and good tasting pizza, nice light crust and even vegan toppings :) The server Doug was a polite waiter and attentive to ours needs. Nice time out. Only downfall is that you don't get a lot of food for the price, but the taste is definitely there . Would be nice to have some bread or a soup to start 

Cheers !",2
Repas pr√©-marathon,3
The service was excellent and the food was terrific! I‚Äôd recommend it for lunch or a casual dinner,3
Great pizza and soup.  Panini's - pass.  Pleasant staff and reasonably fast service.,2
"Great food! Had the rustica pizza and good wine. Disappointed to find they no longer have their mussels on the menu but other than that, great food and outstanding service!",4
"This restaurant is a great place to stop by and eat. The pricing of the food was not expensive. I love the option of customizing your own pizza with the ingredients being near top-notch. Dessert was a treat. Overall great food, great service and nice seating. :)",4
Had an amazing lunch deal. Great atmosphere and waitress was great.,4
"Very friendly, good food.",2
"Good food, fast and friendly service, had our kids with us.",3
Food was average. Service was friendly but not overly competent.,2
"The restaurant was not busy when we arrived but it still took forever to recieved a pear and gorgonzola pizza! Our server also forgot to bring us napkins and delivered the pizza before giving us plates. Lastly, I had to  retrieve hot sauce and condiments on my own as he never returned after we asked for them. 

Wouldn't recommend unless you have time to kill.",1
Horrible service. - no cutlery or napkins and server was non Existent. Food was mediocre at best and NOT worth the price.,0
Good food! Awesome pizza!!! Friendly staff!,3
Food ingredients were such poor quality. Calamari was what I would expect at a cheap chain restaurant - definitely not fresh. So chewy. They used regular mozzarella on a margarita pizza which is supposed to have buffala mozzarella. Basil wasn't fresh and they put tomato sauce on top of the cheese which made no sense.,2
"We had a 5:30 reservation for 6 so we could get to a special event, showed up on time and were told to wait in line. The guy with the list said it would be about 5 minutes. After 10 minutes I had to ask again and explain that we had to be on our way by 7. I was then told that they weren't sure they would be able to seat us. After another 15 minutes and after loosing my cool a bit, they found a table for 4 and another for 2. Not what we came for. I myself asked the people sitting at the table for 2 beside us if they would mind switching and they most gratiously did. The food was good and we did end up with an AMAZING server who helped us forget about the rocky start. Be mindful if you make a reservation and need to be somewhere at a particular time!",1
We had pizza and it was very good... thanks!!!,3
We were looking for a location near buy the hotel and found this place. It was great. The appy was fantastic and the food was made the way we like it.  Nice find.,4
"Amazing food, especially the pizza! Quick and friendly service.  Server offered great recommendations.",3
"Eating here was a strange experience.  The music was so loud we couldn't hear each other across the table. The service was good and the staff were attentive, but there seemed to be a lot of them there.  It felt overstaffed and the staff were just hanging out watching everyone.  The whole time we were there we felt like we were being watched.  It was bazaar. The food was great, the overall experience was not great.",1
This was one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to.  The service was very poor.  The staff wouldn't even look at us.  We weren't offered Parmesan cheese for our pasta which was very bland.  The waitress did not check on us and I had to ask for salt as our table did not have it.  All the rest of the tables did.   I will never eat here again and will recommend that others not either.,0
"Amazing food and service. Very accommodating. Was our first time and it was for our 26th birthday.

The restaurant was even nice enough to give us a complimentary bottle of champagne!

Highly recommend. Thank you for my making my birthday so special!",4
"Had been before and enjoyed it last time. This experience was terrible though. Attempted to order wine but nobody seemed to know what they had or didn't have and were eventually presented with 2 options. Ordered food and after 15 minutes were told they were out of one option. No big deal ... it happens ... but then they were also out of option 2 (simple spaghetti and meatballs). The service seemed chaotic, there were dirty dishes and empty boxes on the bar, and it just wasn't enjoyable. When leaving, the manager (we assume) asked how it was. When we didn't respond positively he offered to make us a free calzone. We had just finished eating so certainly weren't up for that. Very disappointing and we won't return.",0
"We were a little worried when we first arrived because there was only one person working, but
he was quite amazing!  Serving, cooking, taking money.  Finally another staff member 
came and helped out.  The food was delicious and they had vegan options available for
one of our party.  A small but lovely venue for a fine lunch.",3
"Staff was very friendly and professional.
Pizza was good and they had a nice choice of beers.",4
Good - not great.,2
Excelente calidad en La Cocina. Hay q reservar por qu√© si no es dif√≠cil encontrar lugar,3
"Went for christmas dinner so it was quite busy. Somehow the restaurant only had one server, so our food took a long time to come. Not his fault. He did look stressed but it's quite understandable. Not what the low rating is for.

The window beside us had a huge draft so we were cold the whole time. Even the manager was wearing his jacket inside.

The food is pretty atrocious for an ""italian"" place. Commercial made tomato sauce. Meatball sandwich was disgusting. Pizzas were edible but nothing what I would expect from a stone oven. Pasta was decent but nothing to brag about.

Not to mention it's supposed to be a pizza joint but only has like 8 options for pizza, and half of them are a cream sauce base. Are you kidding me? This place is no libretto that's for sure.

Overall I get the sense that the only reason they're still in business is because of an endless supply of blue jay fans coming once, never to return.

Would not go back to this place and would not recommend it for anyone, no apologies.",1
Had a great time. Food was delicious as usual. Always a great salad choice and sharing a pizza with friends.,4
"Pizza was terrible.  Cheese was rubbery, sauce was canned, dough was not cooked in the middle, toppings were bland.   Too many other good restaurants nearby to ever go here again.",1
"I am gluten free and also a vegetarian, I was excited to try their pizza. Unfortunately they were all out of dough, which is understandable. However, this left me to either one kind of gluten free pasta or a salad. Not many options for me and I was not pleased with the quality of the pasta and their sauce. It would be wise for a restaurant that advertises they have gluten free options to have all of their options available.",2
"Delicious food, friendly staff and great ambiance. Highly recommend!",4
"The smoked salmon salad was topped with Kraft processed Parmesan cheese (not fresh), shaken all over the smoked salmon, and the dressing was Kraft Sun-dried tomato. I used to go here quite often and I now remember why don't. If I wanted processed cheese and store bought (cheap and frankly not good) salad dressing I would go to the grocery store - I expected more. I won't be going back.",1
The food and drinks were excellent. My one complaint is that their menu in the restaurant was vastly different than the one posted on their website. I am a vegan and chose this restaurant because of the numerous vegan options I saw on the website and was a little disappointed to learn not all of these items were actually available.,3
Good pregame pizza.  Easy to order and props to the wait and kitchen staff for putting in the effort on a wicked-hot day!,3
"We made a reservation for 4 for 6pm. When we got there at 5:55pm we were told that they don't take reservations on Fridays but they would try to get us in (it was packed with a ball game and concert in town). We were seated by 6:10 and told no problem getting fed and put by 7:00. We still had not been served and had finished our drinks without offer to refill by 6:45. The manager came by to say our meals were on the way and we complained that we had been there nearly an hour and he argued with us! Said there was no way we had been there that long...very rude!
We finally received our meals at 7:05, rushed to eat (did I mention that they didn't have the gluten free pizza dough that was the main reason we chose the restaurant for the dietary needs of our group?), and were offered a measly 15% off and free dessert which they KNEW we didn't have time to eat!!!
Serious disappointment overall and zero tip left by us.",0
"I have been to Pizza Rustica a few times now and always had the best service and the food was great. This time I brought my friends for the first time there before the Blue Jays game and it was absolutely awful; the service was terrible, food took over 45 minutes and this point the restaurant was not as busy and was mostly cleared out. Our server was not attentive, was very slow and took over 20 min to get a machine to pay for our bills. It was a terrible first impression for my friends which was upsetting because it was my first terrible experience there, will seriously consider not coming back, the food however is great.",1
Don't get the penne Arrabiata unless you have a fire hose ready. The chef put two cups of chili pepper in there.,2
We chose to eat here because of the vegan pizza options.,2
"The wait staff were lovely and very friendly but the service was extremely slow and drinks were forgotten, pizza arrived 15 minutes before we had to leave and two were burned so no time to recook.  We told waitress and she apologised saying that whole wheat pizza cooks quicker - surely they knew that already.  And no offer to not charge for burnt food.  Disappointing.",1
"Restaurant was unbearably hot. Although  it was very hot outside, it was hotter inside. We skipped coffee and dessert because of the heat.  Service was very good. However the main course was very disappointing. Two of us had seafood linguine. The shrimp were small and the scallops were the size of a dime. The linguine was incredibly over cooked. Hoping that it was an off night due to volume because of the Jays game.",2
"We were late for our reservation but the restaurant was understanding and accommodated our party, even though it was a busy Friday night.  Our server was extremely pleasant and efficient but the food was VERY disappointing.  I ordered a bruschetta and side caesar salad for my meal and when it arrived, there were these sad looking pieces of bread (couldn't even tell you what type of bread it was other than some sort of grain) with MAYBE 10 little pieces of tomato on each... barely covering the bread itself.  For $11, I shouldn't be able to see the bread underneath from all the lovely tomatoes falling off of it!  While the food disappointed, we would come back based on the service and atmosphere.  Perhaps I'll try the pizza next time - it looked and smelled delicious!",2
"We arrived and had reservations for 5:15 for a summerlicious dinner. I told them we had 
reservations and they did not ask my name or check their books for my reservations but
did seat us inside.  The restaurant was very hot, busy and noisy.  We were taking family
out that was visiting from Florida.  We were not given the summerlicious menu and when
I asked for it she said they do not offer it on game nights.  When I booked the reservation
I wish they had of told me then or it should be on their summerlicious menu.  We got up
and walked out.  We ordered water and that never came.",0
"Very close to leaving because they would not honour the summerlicious promotion...and no one cared if we did (owner or staff).  Rushed our meals, missed a serving for one guest who ordered off the menu, served dessert before main course meal was finished and plates cleared.",2
We had a girl's night out last night  and decided to try the Summerlicious menu. The food and service was great. Portion sizes were ample. We would definitely go back.,4
"The pizza was decent but the salad seemed like what you could have bought from a box kit at grocery stores. They accidentally (?) put olive oil on the plate with my tiramisu and tried to hide it chocolate sauce (that tasted like the squeeze bottle chocolate syrup for icecream sundaes) rather than use a new plate, so the taste was off and I couldn't finish. The prices were low but  the appetizers/desserts weren't worth the price.
 Our server was very friendly, but it was busy so service was slow. It looked like the owner or owner's son was there but he was just sitting around talking to some lady the entire time which felt a bit odd and perhaps he could have been helping the overburdened wait staff. 
Definitely would not recommend or return too since there are much better pizza restaurants in the city with equally reasonable price and higher quality food.",2
Tried Summerlicious menu. Food was good and service was really good. Would recommend.,3
"Food was great, the pizza was outstanding! Our service was extremely slow though. Unfortunately our server was more preoccupied with complaining about previous customers under tipping and flirting with the table of guys behind us.
It took a really long time to get our appetizers and then again to get our dessert. Not sure if this was a server or kitchen issue though.",2
The temperature was way too warm in there and it was very squished. Tables too close together.  Impossible to get out .,2
"Restaurant had run out of vegan cheese, which is why we choose this restaurant. Otherwise the food was very good.",2
"The place is okay but the volume on the TV sets was way way too loud. You could hardly be heard. Don't think I will go back. They would not turn it down. Pizza is great, good vegan options but the noise.",2
"I ordered one with arugula and candied pecans and it was delicious! Lots of variety on the menu, from basic ""normal"" pizzas to adventurous weird ones with obscure ingredients. I would definitely return.",4
A thin crust pizza with a multitude variations on toppings was found at Pizza Rustica!  Reminded me of the pizzas we had in Italy.  Quick turnaround on the order served steaming hot from the oven.   Great take out restaurant as well.,3
Good food but pricing very high  for beer and wine. Suggest no drinks if you try it! Waiting staff slow and inattentive .,0
"Arrived with a reservation made through Open Table and they could not seat us.  Greeter avoided eye contact as she went on with her business and told us to wait.  Asked the manager about our table -- he, too, told us to wait and never returned.  After 30 minutes waiting for our table, we left and will not be back any time soon.  Such bad service.  Ridiculous.....",0
"Oh suffering service! We came here with a group of friends with a reservation before going to see Beyonce and boy were they not prepared. We waited at least 15 minutes before we could get a drink order in and it took at least another 10 to 15 minutes to bring us 2 cocktails and a diet coke. This is just horrible. We decided to place our food order when I drinks arrived, knowing how slow things were seeming and it was a good move on our part. We got our food and  they were fine, maybe a little faster than the drinks. Anyhow, I'd highly recommend that if you come here before an event, give yourself lots of time. It does not seem like they prepare in advance for events and staff accordingly.",2
We have visited Pizza Rustica a number of times en route to Blue Jays baseball games.  Well-located near the Rogers Centre.  Vast variety of pizza options - all have been splendid.,3
"Our Server was excellent - knowledgable, swift and alert to our needs.  It was after a Blue Jays game - very busy - and the gentleman who was at the door was so good at his job.  Listened to where we wanted to sit and kept assuring it wouldn't be long.  Then at the end of our meal, came to our table enquiring if we enjoyed our dinner.  Great dining experience!!'",4
"I've dined at Pizza Rustica for lunch and dinner, summer on the patio with a delicious glass of red sangria.  I've never been disappointed.  The food is excellent, the service is always good and the atmosphere is warm and inviting.",3
The menu has an extensive vegan menu which is an oddity in Toronto. My daughter has been a vegan for years and was impressed by the menu. We ordered a vegan pizza and a salad. It was great. A great place to go before a game at the Rogers Centre as it is very close. Good wine by the glass.,3
"So convenient to have a good supper before the baseball game. Good variety of food, wine and beer. Vegan menu is extensive as well. 
When crowded the tables are close together.",3
"I really like Pizza Rustica and have been going there for years.  We went for lunch this week on the day of the snow storm, so it was extra quiet and cold in the restaurant, but that is at no fault to the restaurant.  I am allergic to wheat and eat their gluten-free pizza which is very good.  However, they were out of the gf dough that day.  Hopefully it was a one-time thing!",3
"Either the server or the kitchen forgot about 1 of the three pizzas ordered, so it arrived for the person after everyone else was finished.  When it did arrive, it was missing prosciutto.  The pizza was taken back and the prosciutto was put on top cold (I'm still not sure if that's the way it was supposed to be served).  Just an apology, nothing more.  I've taken the kids to Boston Pizza where a problem was corrected with a comp on part of the food, or a free dessert was given.  Not required, but certainly ups the service to a new level.  I guess I expected more since this is premium pizza with an associated premium price.",2
"The staff was friendly enough but the service was very slow, probably due to the fact that they only had 2 people working in the kitchen. When our order finally came they brought us the wrong pizza. At this point it was too late to do anything about it so we just ate it. We were so rushed that we had to take our desserts home. Took more than half an hour just to get our apps.
Overall it was ok and not a bad deal.",1
This was a great little place! I had never been before. A girlfriend and I tried it for Winterlicious. The food was great! We couldn't believe it was only $18 for lunch. We went at 3:30pm so it was pretty quite. Would love to try the dinner menu!,3
"First time there and would go back. They have a very extensive menu, especially for gourmet pizza! We had 2 of their pizza's, which were very good and seemed reasonably priced. Also had 2 apps which were also very good. We sat on the patio which was ok for us but might be a bit loud if looking for a more intimate setting, sit inside for that. Lots of people watching to be had outside though.",3
The best meal we had while in Toronto was at this restaurant. Our server was new and very slow.,3
"We went to Rustica on many occasions while working downtown and found it to be a good spot for lunch or after work.  Our recent visit after a three year absence was not what we expected. Food still good but environment  looking worn; slow service, tables not cleared long after customers had left, mops, brooms and other service items leaning against the bar. Seemed lack an overall lack of management oversight - not going back soon.",2
"The food here is exceptionally good for a pizzeria, sharing appetizer platter is first rate, pizzas are great (we had arugula and prosciutto pizza).   Highly recommended.",3
Great spot for groups! Had 30 people  for a birthday party after jays game and made reservations. Handled everything amazingly! They even let us do separate bills for everyone and none of the  typical 'Toronto restaurant attitude' that we were inconveniencing them. Everything was wonderful. Group was rowdy and restaurant never had a problem. Thanks pizza rustica!,4
"The food was great (recommend any pizza, jambalaya pasta, calamari, or mussels).  But when a large group arrived, our server was tied up and had to wait much longer for service. Other wait staff should have assisted.",3
"The restaurant is closed, it was super fun to get there to find the doors closed. Neighboring restaurants said they've been closed for months",0
The store was closed.,0
It was closed,0
We showed up for our reservation and the restaurant was CLOSED!!! And has been closed since October apparently!!! Might want to remove them from Open Table,0
"Well when I showed up for my reservation, I got there and the door was LOCKED because the establishment has been SHUT DOWN! How do you allow reservations to be made at a restaurant that isn‚Äôt even open?! Extremely disappointed and frustrating.",0
I was able to make a reservation on open table but when we got to the restaurant wasn‚Äôt open.,0
Absolutely awful.,0
After making reservations we got there and they were closed and no one was answering calls. It was -6 and Valentine‚Äôs Day so it was tough to find anything else. Very disappointed.,0
"We made a reservation, drove all the way to downtown, paid for parking, only for them to tell us that they were closed. well that would have been good to know!",0
"We made a reservation, got confirmed, showed up and the place was completely closed. We stood outside in the 3 degree weather with no place to go on Valentine‚Äôs Day.",0
"This place is still closed. Google will tell you they are open, and this app will allow you to make reservations, but I can assure you, they are still closed.",0
"Despite being available on opentable, the restaurant was closed (no one was there even to take a takeout order, no one answered the phone) and we were not notified of them being closed online anywhere.",0
"I made reservations, however the location was closed.  This was such a disappointment.",0
"Restaurant was closed when I arrived for my reservation, was closed the entire day",0
Restaurant was closed by the health department. Yet it still let me make an online reservation. There was a sign on the door stating the closure when we got there. Very disappointing because we had to go wait at another restaurant to eat.,0
Was not open,0
"We made reservations, When we arrived to the restaurant it was closed! Way to ruin our New Years.",0
We made a reservation and showed up to find they are closed. So we drove 30 minutes for nothing.,0
"While our reservation was accepted and confirmed, the restaurant was closed when we arrived.",0
Delicious. Best taco Tuesday ever,4
Great food and atmosphere as usual. I would recommend Lime to everyone.,4
"Took my mother to Lime restaurant for her birthday. She‚Äôs a big fan of margaritas & tequila, & Lime is known for their tequilas so I had to take her here. Food & drinks were pretty good. I would come again for a nice girls night out.",3
Our food was delivered and we had no silverware to eat with it took a few minutes to get it so our food got cold.  The music was loud so you couldn‚Äôt here people talk.,2
Cool place for happy hour. Great drink & small plate options! Service was excellent,4
"Delicious flavoring in all the dishes. The vegetarian posole was my favorite dish. The tamales were also good, though I would have preferred to have them wrapped in the husks rather than presented on top of them. Also, they could have used a little more pizzazz like pieces of green chile, in addition to the very good corn kernels.",4
Food was awesome but service was very slow.  Waited for 20 min for waiter to take our drink order.,3
"Probably the worst Mexican I‚Äôve ever had. Margarita was strong which isn‚Äôt a huge problem if you‚Äôre trying to get messed up. But the food quality was horrible.... carne asada was horrible. Queso was basically shredded cheese put in a skillet with ground sausage, basically a bowl of grease with thick stringy cheese. Chicken spinach Quesadilla was okay at best.... Chips were horrible as well which is hard to mess up... not sure who likes the deep fried puffy chips but not my thing. Music was sooooo loaf couldn‚Äôt even talk at the table. Won‚Äôt be going back and I would avoid the place in the future.",0
We always enjoy our time at Line.  The margaritas are great and the food is wonderful!  The wait staff is nice and friendly and very helpful.,4
"Our server was fantastic, made great recommendations and really nice to talk to; great margaritas; the food was all delicious. The sopapillas are a must have at the end of your meal. We did not feel like we were being rushed to give up our table. Perfect place to grab a bite before taking in a show at the Paramount.",3
We just waited too long for someone to help us. The gal that sat was kind enough to take our order for us and apologetic.,1
"Showed up with reservations, no one working at the hostess desk, so we walked in.  Wait staff told us to sit anywhere.  Tables were messy, chairs all over the place.  Sat down and was brought water and menus.  We go to order and the wait staff said due to a mishap in the kitchen they only had appetizers tonight.  We got up and walked out.  Place is dirty, garage doors on inside are cool and probably a great place in the summer but the windows were very dirty and looked like they hadn't been cleaned for some time.  Would not go back.",0
"Read the previous reviews before going to Lime. They were very wrong! We had an awesome time. Food was fresh and delicious, Margarita chicken tacos. Guacamole was best I have ever had in Denver. Only guac better was in avocado capital of southern Cali at top of the season. Highly recommend the Lime signature margarita with cointreau. Our waiter was awesome, fast service as we were there before a concert at the Paramount. Highly recommend you check out the Lime cantina.",4
"Reservation did not register for restaurant. 

Make sure you double check and call this restaurant as their system can ‚Äúlose connection‚Äù to open table when making reservations (or skip open table completely)",0
Did not honor reservation. Had to go somewhere else.,0
"HORRIBLE!!!!! Truly my worst dining experience to date. We arrived and were told we couldn‚Äôt be seated because their steamer which keeps the food warm was broken. It was Christmas, nothing else was open, and they could have let us know prior to our arrival. They said they could seat us but we could only do nachos and drinks, fine. There were no more than 50 people in the restaurant, over 10 staff members, and our drinks took FIFTY MINUTES. When they did come, my margarita was foul. this establishment is a joke and I will never take my business here and will discourage all others from doing the same.",4
"Service was just bad. Took forever to get a waitress, and she was never present. I had actual reservations but seems as if they were under staffed. Food was just okay. I never have to return.",0
"If you are looking for good Mexican food , look somewhere else. I understand today was Christmas but the food was horrible. The waitress was very nice but I should of listen to the bad reviews.",0
"Not impressed by this restaurant. Reception staff was apathetic, area was drafty, and food was lackluster.",2
The table next to us sat dirty the whole time. Staff weren‚Äôt cleaning tables.,2
Might have been an off night but the food was bland and the margarita tasted watered down and had little to no alcohol.  The hostess seemed lost as she navigated us to a table and when she noticed one of the place settings had no silverware she said she would go get some but walked away with the menus.  4 minutes later she comes back with the silverware but no menus.  The waiter finally shows up and asks what we would like and we have to tell him we haven't seen a menu.  It seems like it would be a good place for after-work or pre-party crowd but the drinks need to get stronger and someone in the kitchen needs to find some chilis.,1
"A great place, but very dark and loud in there.  The waitstaff was great but the food took way too long to come out",2
"Serviceable, not spectacular. The service and ambience were average.",2
"Booked high top table so we could communicate with each other. Told at arrival that I should have called. A high top sat empty our entire visit. Very frustrating. When I brought it up it wasn‚Äôt handled very well. Then the music went up. Like we were being punished. 

On a positive note...our service was over the top. The waiter was very responsive. He did a fantastic job.",2
"There was hardly anyone in this restaurant at 7 pm on a Saturday.  This should have been my first clue that something was not right with this restaurant.   It took 10 min. for our waiter to even come to our table which should have been my 2nd clue considering the place was so empty.   The thought crossed my mind to leave when it took so long for our waiter to come to our table, but I thought it might get better.  
It did not get any better.  The food was very average.   There are so many better places to eat downtown.",0
"We had our daughter and friends sit at a separate table for her birthday (and even mentioned ‚Äúbirthday‚Äù in the reservation comments). I quickly mentioned to our server that I would like to speak to their server just to say hi and let them know we, the parents, were at this other table. The girls did not get service until 30 minutes after being seated. The oil used for the chips needed to be changed (funny taste). The manager was talking with the wait staff all night and oddly didn‚Äôt say a word when we walked right by upon leaving. Our server was nice but the whole vibe was off and do not recommend.",1
Food was fine but the service  was not good. Our server forgot about us throughout the evening we had to go find her a couple of times.,1
"Was an enjoyable experience. Had the chips with salsa, guacamole, their ‚ÄúScorpions‚Äù (basically a jalape√±o popper with shrimp), the green chili, and street tacos. Gold Margarita was good and decent price for the size.",4
"Food was ok only thing i didnt like is that the restaurant does not read instructions at all, it was my husbands bday and i wrote that at the end of meal if they could bring a dessert like cake to sing happy bday and nothing. Service is so so or the server we had was not to polite and proffesional at all.",2
"The reservation was ready for us on arrival, the staff very pleasant, and our order was flawless.  The ambiance was upbeat, with a good blend of dark and light areas.  In all, a very enjoyable experience.",4
"Great views of 16th street but not my favorite food. Good margaritas. Services is eh. Queso was sad. Fun for a group happy hour thing, but not if you‚Äôre wanting a great dinner and service.",2
Great margaritas and the best happy hour!!!  Service was excellent!,4
"Went for Taco Tuesday. Ended up getting a taco plate on the dinner menu instead, habanero shrimp. 20 oz. Jalapeno Marg to wash it down. Margarita wasn't made how described, had wayyyyy to much jalapeno, no flavor,  not enjoyable. I could barely drink it. Tacos came out with no toppings. Just tiny little shrimp in a corn tortilla for $10.00. Bland at best. Best part of the whole experience was the queso blanco. I don't think I will be back. $66 for all of that. Not worth it.",2
"Horrible food, horrible service, and horrible atmosphere!",0
"We were told when we arrived ""we don't take reservations.""",1
Wouldn‚Äôt recommend - so many great restaurant options in Denver and this would not be one of those options,1
"The margaritas we ordered off the menu tasted like something you could get at Chili's. The shishito peppers for an appetizer were extremely bland with no spice to them, plus they brought this small amount of dip with the peppers in a plastic container (why not have it be in a ceramic, washable container for the environment?). Lastly, the restaurant had on all the TV's some sort of ""Cops"" show on, which I don't think promotes a great ambiance that customers want when out on a Friday night date.",1
"I brought a group of over 12 people, who did not all arrive or order at the same time.  The servers were amazing and accommodating.  We had a great time!  The music volume was suddenly and dramatically changed several times while we were there, which was very annoying and disruptive.  But otherwise a great experience, as always.",4
"We did not enjoy our meal. Service was slow, meals came with wrong items, and none of it was very good. The guacamole was gross. Even the margarita was bad. We will never be back.",1
"The food was very good.  A friend and I split a taco platter (the one downside here is,  for whatever reason, you can only get 3 street tacos of the same protein) that was pulled pork, seared ahi, and margarita chicken.  The pulled pork and ahi were outstanding; the flavor of the chicken was good, but the meat was dry.  The other part of our party had the ceviche and deep fried avocado and both were really happy.  Service was good; one of the margaritas we ordered came out much too sweet for our liking and it was quickly and cheerfully exchanged for a re-make.  For ""downtown"" the prices are super reasonable.",3
"First, it was rather cold outside and all their garage doors were open. Then they sat us at a table underneath a air conditioner blowing freezing air on our table. When we finally moved tables, they brought us every day grocery style chips. They said they were out of their in-house fresh chips, but it just seemed that everything was off that night. The restaurant was really really empty and I can see why. I‚Äôm not sure I would go back.",0
Excellent traditional and modern Mexican. I‚Äôd go back for sure!,4
Great food! Great service! Definitely will be back!,4
"It's a nice place. The food is a little overpriced. We got there at 5:23pm to enjoy happy hour. Order queso and nachos. The server didn't put our check in until after 6pm and told us we got the full size orders instead of the smaller happy hour orders so he wouldn't give us happy hour pricing. I think he should've asked us if we wanted the happy hour or the regular orders. Especially if we were there in happy hour. He also was a little sarcastic and rude. I think he was trying to be funny but it didn't work for him. Got annoyed that we asked for straws because he doesn't like to waste them and then had to go out of his way to get them for us. 
The place itself is really nice. I always like to sit by the window so I can watch what happens down on 16th Street.",3
"This was my first time at Lime, unfortunately it appeared that they had quite a few new staff which caused some chaos, however, the chips and guac was enough to push that far out of my mind.  By far the BEST chips I have ever had at a Mexican restaurants.  I always rate my Mexican experience on the chips and salsa.  The margaritas were ok, we also had the queso, I had the chicken salad, my husband had the steak street tacos and our friend had the chicken burrito, we all enjoyed the food.  Again, the chips are heaven in a basket",3
Had a great table for me and my friends for my birthday! So fun,4
"We've eaten here several times and have had a great experience. This time, celebrating Mother's Day our service was great. Brad was was great! We'll be back.",4
"Best frozen margaritas, great atmosphere. Favorite Mexican spot.",4
"I had a reservation for 615p. Our order was taken about 6:40p. At about 725p we still did not have our meals. We asked to talk to the manager. Someone came to the table who said she was the assistant manager and told us our meals were up and ready to be delivered.  She told us a group of prom students came in at the last minute and they were working on their food and that‚Äôs why ours was taking so long. Keep in mind we planned in advance and had a reservation. Then five minutes later a man who said he was the manager just got to work and they‚Äôre finishing up our meals And that he would take care of our meals.

Our meals came at 7:40 PM. We ate what we could for five minutes and then went over to the Paramont for the event we had tickets for.  It was date night celebration with husband for his birthday.

 So sad no one came just to apologize at the end after the meal had come. On a good note the ambience was nice and the chips were very good.",0
Was in town for a college visit with my niece and this restaurant was AMAZING!!!,4
Have been to this restaurant many times and it always takes a long time for the food.  This time it was around an hour and 15  minutes.    This time I found the food itself very average.,2
"Service was horrible for party of 10. 5pm reservation for a show at 7pm across the street, and we were late.",1
Had a great time drinks and food were awesome,4
"The fish tacos were disappointing as they were like nuggets without much relish. 
I prefer corn tortilla chips to flour so that was disappointing too. 
Enjoyed the Irish dancing and waiter was good.",3
They have really good tacos and the Coin margarita is worth every penny.  We visited on St. Party's Day before a theater show so it was a bit too busy. They handled it well but maybe were a little understaffed.,3
"It was alright...service was sooooooooooo slow, the food was fine, probably wouldn‚Äôt go back though",2
Atmosphere of dance area was very appealing. Food was ok. Manager was incredibly rude and not accommodating. We got seated an hour late even after making a reservation and she couldn't even apologize for our inconvenience.,2
"Good food, music was super fun",3
"Reserved table for 12, got table for 10, waiter corrected by adding an extra table, drinks are way to strong, and food was ok",3
Short woman that was in front helping seat people was VERY RUDE! I made reservations but once arrived other people WITHOUT reservations was getting seated before us because they had only 2 parties,1
"The food is always great.  The margaritas are awesome and the service is spot on.  We try to hit Lime several times a year, especially in the summer when the patio is open.  Definitely recommend!",4
The DJs music was a little too much for dinner at 5:30...,2
"Wish the service was a little quicker, spent 30mins waiting on alcoholic drinks and tacos",2
I loved the guacamole!,3
"Unfortunately, the other mediocre reviews should have steered me away but they proved to be true. The night was very quiet, which was nice but we were seated at a table that was doubling as an earthquake simulator so we asked to move, which the served did promptly. They brought us our beers quickly and while the beer was frosty, I ended up with a piece of glass in my first sip. The server brought out another beer quickly but never really addressed the glass. The food left a lot to be desired flavor-wise. When we got the bill, nothing was addressed as far as the glass fiasco. Overall: service = good, food = eh, and customer care = below average.",1
Best place to get tacos and margaritas on a Tuesday! Service is great and so fast. Love the mushroom tacos and carnitas!,4
We really this restaurant but the food is HORRIBLE now. We ordered our food hot and it wasn‚Äôt even mild. Over cooked . Margaritas were less then good . What happened to this  restaurant . We had multiple people warn us how bad it is now. I didn‚Äôt believe them. I believe now and won‚Äôt be back . Service was great .,0
"Food waiter brought a few small sides with my meal - had no idea that my meal didn‚Äôt come with them, so I dug in. He came back to take them away after we ate some of it. I told him not my fault they screwed up, I didn‚Äôt know. What are you going to do? Give them to the right person? Gross!! Then the manager came over & said to give them back or she‚Äôd add them to my bill. I handed them over. Wow! A small bowl of rice & beans & guac. You‚Äôre eating the cost anyway so instead of just letting me keep them = happy customer. You took them away from me = angry customer! She was very rude about the whole thing too. Like it was my fault. Sorry. Won‚Äôt be back!",0
"I have been to Lime several times before and had good service, so I anticipated good service again. Unfortunately, on this visit the service left something to be desired. It was clear, and the wait staff admitted, that the restaurant was short staffed. While it is understandable that things happen and someone had called in sick, if everyone had been there, they would have still been short staffed for a Saturday night in downtown Denver. They seemed surprised that people actually wanted to eat out on a Saturday night. We ordered a simple appetizer of guacamole and it took 30 minutes for it to be delivered and took several reminders to the waiter that we had not yet received our order. Once the guacamole finally arrived and it was time to order our main course, our waiter was nowhere to be found and different waiter actually took our order. There was no attempt made to apologize or make it right. As we were leaving we were offered a free tequila shot, which is a terrible attempt to make up for such poor service. Overall, I would not recommend going to Lime on a weekend and will likely not visit anytime soon given the abundance of high quality restaurants in Denver.",0
"Third time was not a charm.  I ordered Carne Asada, which you would think a Mexican restaurant could prepare.  Ordered Medium Rare - first one came to me well done so I sent it back.  Second one came back basically raw, so I sent it back.  Third one came back not much better and an obviously inferior piece of meat (could hardly cut into it to see if it was done).  By this time my husband had finished his meal and we didn't want to wait another 20 minutes to try again. We had already been there over an hour.  I was told the manager would comp my meal.  I packed it up in the container they gave me then the assistant manager informed me that since I was taking it home (I was going to finish cooking it), they wouldn't be able to comp it.  So I left that nasty raw steak at the restaurant (and they didn't charge me for the steak but didn't comp anything else).  Amazingly poor attention from the kitchen AND manager.   Our server was very attentive and apologetic but it's not his fault.  I would NOT recommend this place nor return to it.",1
The waiter spilled my margarita on my lab and the manager fought with me to comp my meal.,0
Went on a Wednesday night about 7:00 PM. Not busy. We sat in the dining area and felt alone and ignored.   Food was great. Better experience on previous visits,1
"I would have loved to rate this a 5star but we were disappointed in the reservations we made. Specifically requesting that we get ANY window seat/ or seat with a scenic view of downtown, making our reservation a month in advance, we were booted from our seats for a birthday party that rented out the entire window seating area. I mentioned this to the hostess and specifically said that I would have preferred someone call me to tell me that they would no longer accommodate our reservation, instead she said ""we were afraid that you would cancel"". You're damn right I would have cancelled! I was furious, but since I was already in downtown for a show at the Paramount, I had NO time to look for a new restaurant. I was disappointed in their customer service, and sometimes that says it all - not sure if we'll return. Waiter was friendly, almost too friendly - and spent way to long chatting with customers and our drink order took way to long. Food tasted good.",2
Extremely poor service - server was non-existent - took 2 hours for dinner - completely unacceptable.,0
"I've been eating at Lime locations in Colorado for years, the last few visits to the downtown/Pavilions location have been very disappointing. This time was the worst and may be the last time. The service was slow, all of our meals came out at different times and at various temperatures (some hot, some cold) and my grandma didn't even get hers so we cancelled her taco order in the end. Our reservation was for 7 people at 7pm, some got our food at 7:55 and we were trying to go to a movie at 8:10. The waiter was inattentive and unapologetic for the waiting and never checked on us. Very disappointing! I used to go to the Lime xs on 6th weekly and I knew the manager there at one point before it closed but it's so bad now I won't be going anymore.  2 stars is generous. Bye Lime!",1
"This was one of the absolute WORST experiences I've ever had. First we were told the wait would be over an hour then I was able to find a reservation on Open Table for 15 minutes later. Our server was visibly frazzled when he ""greeted"" our table and was unable to answer simple questions about what was on tap or what was in their menu items. We then sat for an HOUR before he came over to let us know the kitchen was backed up and asked if we would like some chips. 15 minutes later our food had still not come out and when pressed he said he thought it would probably still be awhile. After sitting for an hour and a half with NO FOOD we decided to leave. Hostess and server did nothing to try and compensate us for our wait. Ridiculous!",0
"Quite possibly the worst service I have ever had. Will not go back. No communication  as to why the 2/3 empty restaurant wasn‚Äôt able to serve us our dinner until nearly 9p when we ordered before 7:30p. When asking for updates we were told the kitchen was slammed and couldn‚Äôt catch up. Perhaps you should tell people that before to seat them so they have the option to go elsewhere. 
Oh, and if your restaurant is 2/3 empty with a backed up kitchen your waitresses should at least make sure people have full water glasses and the chips and salsa are refilled. 
Bottom line, if you are located on 16th street in downtown Denver near the Paramount Theater you should expect traffic when they have not one, but two shows on a Saturday night.",0
"It literally took 2 hours to get our food since someone (manager?) cancelled our ticket for some unknown reason. Then gave us the full bill with a straight face. After a brief conversation, the bill was cut in half. Too bad. A group of moms finally get a night out and this is how it played out. The food was good, but the experience left much to be desired.",0
"The atmosphere is fun and food and margaritas were good.  Service was terrible.  We waited almost an hour and a half for our food.  It was not crowded enough to justify that kind of wait.  The manager seemed very unsure of what to do about it.    They brought out a few waters for us, but we had to ask for more so we each had one.  We also had to ask for silverware after our food finally arrived.     With so many other choices nearby I would not go back.",0
"A large group of us ladies went here before a show and had terrible service! We were there 2 hours before show, ordered drinks and apps, and our food never did show up before we had to leave for the show!
Then, they rang our bills before the food even came, so we had to track down the manager to get refunded and that took another 10 - 15 minutes!
While it was a busy night, we were there with plenty of time to spare.
Our waiter David, was kind, and did his best, but the food service and the management was poor at best!
Very disappointed.",1
"Good food 
Excellent server, David
Ribs were very good",4
"Went here before and came back because we enjoyed it. This time the food was not very good and the Margarita's we has were too strong. Service was good but the dining room appeared somewhat dirty. The place was packed the last time we came and now it was not, maybe a sign of the decline....",1
I was disappointed with the service we waited over 20mins for a server to come to the table & I was told ballons would be at the table for the birthday there was no acknowledgement. The server included the gratuity in the bill without tellin us that would be the case.  I will b seeking taco tuesday someplace else in the future,1
This is a super cute place to eat or meet up for drinks. It‚Äôs great for people watching because it overlooks the 16th street mall. We went to grab a bite before heading to LoDo for a night out. The food was great. My only issue was that about 10 minutes into our night (before our drinks arrived) they lowered all of the lights and turned off the upbeat music.. well all the music. This does not fair well if you‚Äôre having drinks socializing. It went completely dead... so quiet that after we ate we considered just going home because we were so bored. Not sure how they expect people to want to hang out in a mortuary.  So we left our food and drinks and told our party to meet us somewhere more lively to start off our night.,3
"I used to enjoy going to Lime, but unfortunately the food and service have definitely gone downhill.  I ordered grilled shrimp tacos and they were very bland -- even adding salsa to them.  The time before I had the skirt steak and it was actually decent.  

My biggest problem with the restaurant however is that even though it's been pretty empty the last 3 times we've gone for lunch, it takes more than 45 minutes for the food to come out.  This last visit, there were literally only 3 other tables of diners and it still took that long.  The server was not at fault.  She was great.  But this is definitely not worth the the wait.",1
Love Taco Tuesdays and the staff here is always amazing!!!!!!,4
"Our server got multiple orders incorrect (I asked for no black beans and I got a heaping portion, my friend ordered a vodka soda with lime juice and it came with no soda, etc.) She skipped over me entirely for my drink order and I had to call for her when she walked away so I could get a Pepsi. The food was okay, nothing special. Our server kept disappearing and other people kept coming over to help us, but could not get anything ordered because they were not our server. The hostess and everyone else besides our server were great. Also, my Open Table reservation never got to the restaurant. The server  brought us all of our checks while we were hardly halfway through our meal, and this was after she had to come back multiple times to ask who was on which check (we had told her in the beginning of the meal that we would need separate checks and who would be on which bill, hoping to make it easier on her). Overall, not a great experience.",1
"Was seated right away, but then it was about 10 minutes before someone took our drink order.  We ordered the Queso app and it was watery, my husband made the comment that it was watery and the waitress told him she would check with kitchen, when she came back she just said that is how it always is.  Our dinner was so so nothing fantastic.  We didn't see much of the waitress the whole time, once we finished out meal it took her 15 minutes to bring the check.  We were very disappointed in the experience, we have dined at Lime before and the food in the past has been much better and the service has never been this bad.  Probably won't be back, lots of other places in the area to try.",1
Fun evening with family friends. Food was flavorful and creative. Drinks were fun!,3
"This was seriously the worst restaurant experience I have ever had. We made a reservation for our group and showed up on time. The table was ready, but not a huge surprise with the restaurant mostly empty. We ordered drinks. The drinks for two of our people tasted awful and were sent back. One of them was then brought two drinks they didn't order and didn't want. We ordered food (eventually because our waitress came around rarely). Then the food took a long time in the kitchen. They bring it out, and it's inexplicably missing for two of our people. They wait wait wait. It still never comes. We had to be leaving for an event and they still didn't have their food (this is 2 hours into being at the restaurant -- it's not like we tried to swoop in and get in/out in 45 minutes). Come to find out the waitress has been there 2 days and the manager is not training/supporting/helping her. The checks were, of course, a FIASCO. And the manager was just nonchalant, like ""hey sorry it sucks, right?"" Overall, we were so mad. DO NOT EAT HERE.",0
Really loved the grilled fish tacos.,4
Decent food. Didn‚Äôt get what we ordered. Otherwise ok.,2
"My experience here was just okay. We made a reservation online but then the hostess informed us that they don't accept reservations on Tuesdays. That wasn't mentioned anywhere online as I made my reservation and it was confirmed online. We waited about 20 mins to be seated during a Tuesday lunch hour. Then, once we were seated, we waited even longer to even be given water and have our order taken. My companion and I both ordered taco salads only to be informed it might take awhile because the kitchen was backed up. Taco salad was probably the easiest thing on the menu for them to make... I will say that I was impressed with the portion of protein they served, the salad was more a bowl of meat with some lettuce than the other way away. I would have liked a little more lettuce so that it continued to resemble a salad. Overall, I don't know that I would recommend going there for lunch. The salads were $13 a pop and just okay, plus a lot of waiting and delays.",2
"The service was slow, but the food was great!  Their chips are the best there is!!",2
"Unfortunately not impressed. The place looked stylish and the food looked good but as they say, ‚ÄúLooks aren‚Äôt everything‚Äù.

Hostess was not friendly and was actually a little rude. Our server was very friendly and polite but the service was slow.

When the food came out the portions were large and looked very tasty... unfortunately we found the food to be somewhat bland.",1
"Received our appetizer before our water/bar drinks.  Appetizer was a dip to be eaten with chips and chips came way after our dip. 

Received the wrong drinks. We questioned the drink and waiter's response was just, ""yes, you were given the right ones....I can show you the ticket"".  I ordered another one and received the right one this time around. Same color, but 100% different. 

Food was awful.  We barely touched our meal and not a single word was said about our plates, still full of food.  Waiter never asked if we enjoyed the food or if we needed anything else.  

We had to ask for our check after sitting for an extended period of time. $74 wasted.",0
Service was nice. Burrito we ordered wasn‚Äôt very goodüòû,2
Really liked our food.  Be nice if some low tables and seating were closer to the windows. But overall quite good and I would definitely go again.,3
"YUM, YUM, YUM. Margaritas were amazing. We ended up staying at the bar for dinner and the bartender was awesome. We were with friends who had been there before and suggested it. I look forward to going back!",4
"Food was pretty solid. Ambiance was awful. Service varied wildly between the many servers- from
Friendly to hostile.  It was overall just mediocre. I would only go back if I needed a fast meal before a movie at Pavilions.",2
I‚Äôve been here before when I visit Denver and it‚Äôs always a fun lively place to visit. Excellent guacamole and tortilla chips to,3
Family get together,4
"THE WORST EXPERIENCE. Lunch took TWO hours and all they did was take half off the bill.
Terrible and no one seemed to really care.",0
"Waited 10 minutes to be seated and when we finally were it was in the bar area during Friday happy hour.  Minglers were bumping into, and putting drinks on, our table. My friend and I decided  to leave because it was hard for us to hear each other, and the waitress was very understanding.  

I really wasn't irritated until I saw that the restaurant had cancelled our reservation, presumably so I could not write this review...OT fixed that for me.  Can't comment on the food, but seemed like a fun place for happy hour.",1
Hanna was our waitress and she rocked. The food was really delicious and the chips and salsa is to die for.,2
"Fun place, great food, fantastic drinks.",4
Fabulous food and service,4
Visited for a welcome lunch for new employee and lucked into Taco Tuesday!,3
Very bland. Server was very rude. Just overall kind bad experience.,0
"My uncle and I had dinner during Denver's Restaurant Week at Lime. It's located in the Pavilion on the 3rd floor, so unless you remember that huge fact and just show up at 500 16th St., you'll never find it. The location is very convenient, but getting to the 3rd floor isn't so much fun with older people. The $25 special for Restaurant Week included a signature margarita, which was great! For a drink, appetizer, and entr√©e, it was so worth the visit to Lime. The dining area is clean, and the bar areas are nice too! Would visit again!!",3
"We've been coming to Lime for years and we haven't been in a while. Sadly, we were kind of disappointed. Our server told us they were super short staffed and that there was only 2 of them for the whole place. It wasn't her fault at all, but falls on management. I didn't even see a manager walking around helping out or anything. 

The margaritas are always amazing but I had to ask several times for limes for our drinks. Food was amazing as always. We were pretty sad that they changed their salsa, it used to be so spicy and good! Now it's like tomato paste but their chips are still the best! Our food took forever but was worth it. We ended up being really late to our friend's birthday party because of the slow service overall. 

We'll be back and it will hopefully be a more positive visit!",2
"First time there, since they moved from Larimer. Great experience! Great value, great atmosphere, and the best part was Sergio our server. Was always there at the right time, and fantastic personally. Would highly recommend for any occasion.",4
Very slow service and food was just ok. The restaurant seemed empty and it was still slow service.,2
our horrible experience basically boiled down to one very horrible waitress. It was almost comical how bad it was. Iltimately the food wasn't good enough to give it another try. Wouldn't waste your time trying it out.,0
"Excellent food and service.  Nice layout for dining and bar with very nice of 16th Street Mall.  Just wish it was a little bit quieter for conversation.  Of course the place was full of ""You Owe -illennials"" who can't live without their electronics.   We'll go back but not Thurs thru Sat evening.",4
"I hosted a happy hour for a professional group here yesterday, and I was very impressed with the service I received. They had the room set up exactly as I asked. The food was delicious and timely. Their staff helped walk me through what to order, and their advice was spot-on. They were extremely flexible and kind when I had some last-minute changes. We will be hosting events with Lime again in the future!",4
This was a great place to spend New Year's Eve! We had a great dinner and then went out on to 16th Street Mall to watch the 9 p.m. fireworks!!,3
This was my first visit and I will definitely be back! I had the enchiladas and they were very good.,4
Reserved a large table at Open Table for lunch only to be told they do not accept reservations on Tuesday's because they are so busy. Food was mediocre to poor. Nobody cleared our dishes after we were finished eating. Disappointing experience.,1
"If you're looking for anything resembling authentic Mexican food - this is not it. I found the food to be a bland, Americanized version of Mexican food.  The Jalepeno margarita was watery with very little actual Jalepeno taste and no bite. The enchiladas were drenched in cheese with a very mild green chile sauce.  Our table, which consisted of two mismatched smaller tables, was dirty, as was my plastic menu (both were sticky with old salsa).  My wife said she enjoyed her fish tacos but I didn't found them comparable to what you can get  at many fast/casual restaurants.  Sorry, but I can't recommend this for anything other than a quick, inexpensive bite.",1
The food was really good. Staff was very attentive.  The only issue I had was that I ordered a house merlot & they were out. Rather than find another wine & charge the same price (which most places do when they run out) this place found a different wine & charged me the additional price. Won't return all bc of that. Trivial but worth noting .,3
"Lime used to be great and unique. no more. the food is nothing special and you get to pay $7 for parking. there are so many really special Mexican food restaurants, this is definitely not one of them. go to Sol in cherry creek. or anywhere else.",0
"Bad margs, bad service, bad food",0
I met a friend for lunch and we were able to sit outside.  The patio was comfortable and clean.  Our server was very nice and attentive and the food was great.  Looking forward to going back again.,4
"We were very disappointed with our dining experience here. We had been wanting to go here for a while, and even after making reservations, we were seated in the middle of the restaurant after we asked for a table on the patio or near the bar. After moving to near the bar ourselves, we had to wait twenty minutes for service so we finally moved to the actual bar and was able to order a drink. The drinks were made wrong, the food order was wrong twice, just very disappointed overall.",1
"My Wife and I dined for probably the 5th or 6th time at this restaurant.   Food, as always, was reliably tasty and authentic.  I had the Tres Enchiladas, each with a different meat filling, and the standard Lime rice and black beans accompanied the meal.  The complimentary chips and salsa are always delectable.   I washed my meal down with two margaritas on the rocks.   Would have liked them to be a bit more potent, but this is a common problem in my experience with many margaritas at restaurants.  Too much mix, not enough tequila.  My Wife enjoyed the Carne Asada, cooked just the way she ordered it, medium.  She also complained that her Mint Julep was lacking in much of an alcoholic kick.   Service was fine on this quiet Saturday late afternoon.",3
"I requested a table with a view through Open Table, as we had several guests visiting from out of town and they wanted a view of the 16th street mall.  I also called the restaurant that morning, spoke to John, and he assured we would have a window table.  When we arrived none of this information had been shared with the hostesses.  They attempted to seat us in a dark corner.  After negotiations, they eventually seated us in the bar.  The hostesses were short with us and not accommodating, and the bar waitress was not happy to be serving a table of 7 and was unhappy the entire evening.  If you are going there only for the food, it's great. If you want exceptional service, this is not the place.",2
We made a reservation but waited an extra 20 minutes after the time to get a table,2
"Great appetizer, excellent food and awesome service (from Jeremiah). This is a hidden gem in the Pavillions on top floor.",4
We just left the ball game around the 7th inning due to cold fierce blowing winds and we were looking for a place to watch the rest of the game on TV and to keep the beer buzz going. Lime provided lots of big screens and tons of choices of top shelf tequilas in flights and pitchers of margaritas. We sampled lots of bites and floated far above mile high stadium. Excellent service and ambience.,3
So-so food. Prompt service. OK for an everyday lunch. Nothing special.,2
"We love Lime and have been going there for years.  Typically fast and friendly.  This time, service was fantastic.",4
"Great service, food and atmosphere. What else do you need for a successful night out? Maybe one of their yummy jalape√±o margaritas!!",4
One of our favorite spots for a great mojito and tasty chips and salsa! Tacos del Carbon are always tasty.,3
"Great service, but the food was pretty bland. No flavor. Had chicken tacos and my spouse had chili rellenos.",2
"The reason for the 3 stars on service was because a friend and I went for lunch and we had made reservations. When we got there it wasn't busy at all and they sat us in the main dining room. We sat for about 5-6 minutes and no one came to our table to greet us or take a drink order. When you only get an hour for lunch it is important to be waited on quickly. So, we moved to the bar area and the bartender was attentive, quick and very pleasant. The food was very good and the chips and salsa were great to!",2
"Experience was beyond horrible!!! We had reservations for 8 people at noon.  We were taken to a table in the bar area.  Should have seen that as a problem to begin with.  The restaurant was so grossly understaffed, it was ridiculous! The bartender was also our waitress, sort of.  We did tell her we had theater at 2:00 pm.  We had nothing to drink for almost 30 minutes, did not place our food order until some 55 minutes after noon, at 1:35 pm still had NO FOOD and had to leave for our theater show that started at 2:00 pm without every eating! Our theater group has been dinning together for 15+ years.  We always make a reservation since we are such a large group, never ask for separate checks, and order directly off the menu without any special requests.  Any other restaurant in Denver has taken our order by 12:30 pm and  by 1:00 pm we normally have food (1 hour after we have arrived, BTW). We eat, settle our one bill and are out by 1:40 pm. I am not sure why everyone else knew there was going to be a Women's March on January 21st in Denver except for the management at Lime.  That was the excuse they keep giving us...",0
"Awful service, took 30 minutes for our drinks to be brought to us. And another 30 before our server came back to get our order, maybe 2 hours total before we ate. Unfortunate New Year's Eve dinner, we won't be backs",0
I really enjoy the atmosphere and drinks. Those are my favorite things about Lime.,4
"If you are looking for a good rendition of well established Colorado Mexican (pretty similar to New Mexico Mexican) food, this isn't it.  Everything has an odd twist to it, e.g., a chile relleno coated with panko and deep fried.  It wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't what I was expecting or wanted.  I thought the green corn tamale was too sweet and the black beans downright odd.  The margaritas were, however, on the mark.  So, although I wouldn't try it again, I think Lime represents another waypoint in the evolving world of American Mexican cuisine.",1
"Came here for my birthday. The only thing good about the entire night was the service. The food was just ok, all of us said we wouldn't order the same thing again. I ordered three separate margaritas and they were all equally horrible. Dont  waste your time or money on this place.",1
"The value of taco Tuesday is fantastic, albeit the addition of required soda purchase stinks given I'm a water drinker, but still an excellent value.  Tacos and chips are great;  my friends I enjoy grabbing lunch here at least once a week.",3
Service was slow! It took us 25 minutes to get our drinks and over and hour to get our food. Only saving grace was that our waitress was very friendly and apologetic.,0
"Not great service,food was cold,Margaritas were plain.",1
"Not good.  They didn't have our Open Table reservation, or at least couldn't find it. Initially we were greeted promptly by our server.  Chips and salsa showed up about 5 minutes before our drinks.  Taco Tuesday, our 10 taco order took about 25 minutes to show up.  Not a lot of attention to our table for filling up drinks.  Bill took a bit to get.  Wasn't that busy to warrant the slow/poor service.  Another customer tracked down our server to pay his bill and then was telling the manager about their poor experience.  Since we started going to Taco Tuesday the experience has gotten worse over the past year.  I also noticed not as many customers waiting to eat there at lunch time, with good reason",1
"I ate dinner at Lime on 7/10/16 with my husband and a few co-workers in town visiting. I can only describe the experience as disappointing. The food was good, but the service was bad. We waited nearly 20 minutes for the waiter to take our drink order. At that time he finally came over, we wisely ordered our food too. The food came as expected but one of the salads had the wrong dressing so the right one was immediately requested. The new dressing arrived 45 minutes later (20 minutes after all our plates were cleared). Of course we had given up and just ate the dressing that came initially. 

Our waiter never came and asked us how our meals were, refilled waters or drinks and showed up 20 minutes after we were done with a check that was incorrect. It had an appetizer and dessert we never on the bill (good thing we checked it). The waiter was not apologetic. The sad part was the place was maybe 25% full and there seemed to be plenty of staff.",1
"Waited almost an hour for food, then we didn't receive all the items we requested, by the time food came it was soggy.",0
"On the third floor of the Pavilions, so it has an excellent panoramic view of the 16th St mall. Beautiful bars, great tequila selection, and tasty appetizers. Nice big tables to accommodate larger groups",4
Loved it and our server was the best ever.  absolutely made our night,4
We always have a blast when we go to Lime for Taco Tuesday...  It's a must!,3
Seemed extra busy tonight. Hard for the staff to keep up!,3
"It's Cinco de Mayo and I know the wait is expected but with a reservation at 8PM and no drinks, apps, chips and salsa, or even an attempt to take our food order 48 mins later made this patron notify management which could only respond with ""I'm sorry"" before we had to walk away without the opportunity to taste anything besides the tap water given to us upon being sat down. 

Service - Bad
Management - Even worse
Water - Not as good as Dillion's water, but not as bad as the service.",0
"The food was good, but not as good as it was when this restaurant first opened. The guacamole tostada was bland and disappointing; I was really looking forward to it so it was a let down. The chili rellano was not the best I've had, but still good. The chips and salsa is always fresh and full of flavor here and was the highlight of our meal.",2
"I met a colleague for a business luncheon at Lime Cantina.
The Mexican menu is diverse and features many gluten free and vegetarian options, which was a major plus for my colleague.  The house salsa, a key test, was fresh, thick, and tasty, without too much sugar or heat.  Most importantly - the tables are widely spaced and the noise level is low, something very conducive to business conversation. There is plenty of parking in Pavillions complex.",3
"Have not been to Lime since they moved to the Pavillions,  however the food was very average, especially vs how it used to at its other locations.  

Our server, Chelsea, had a terrific personality and was very fun and super professional, however her support team was definitely the ""new team"".    They weren't very familiar with what they were serving, and brought us a few of the wrong dishes.  

Overall, Lime is now a Mexican ""sports bar food"" kind of place.   Lots of big screen TVs, but not much Mexican about it.",2
The restaurant has the Lime moniker and not the food quality or service.  Nothing special about this place except that it is in Lodo.  I think you would do better to pick an alternative.,2
"The menu at Lime had some very different ""Mexican"" fare.  I had stuffed avocados which were delicious.  My group also loved the tortilla chips made from pieces of flour tortillas that were deep-fried.",4
Very fun environment with great service. Food was very excellent and well priced.,4
"Though the place was half empty, they clustered all of the parties in one area in close quarters. Made private conversations almost impossible.",2
"We had so much fun here for my birthday dinner. We had a  party of 14 and their service was still amazing. On top of that, they gave us all complimentary lime shots for my birthday! And the food was delicious. Thanks for making my birthday dinner great!",4
We did wait awhile for our food which was frustrating because the place was near empty (where we were seated) and we only had a small window to eat before returning to a conference.  But we made it out a little late and the food was terrific. Thank you Carlos!,3
"Our server was great! Very friendly and attentive. Their complimentary chips and salsa was good. They have two types of chips, flour and corn - corn was better. For was okay. My friend goes there all the time and always gets the corn tamales but she mentioned it did not taste as good. Mine was very plain...got the stuffed avocado..not enough chicken. I honestly think the chips and salsa and our server was the best thing there.",2
Our server (can't recall her name) and our busboy Chris were uber attentive and very welcoming. I'm in a wheelchair scooter with my service dog. All the staff really made SURE WE WERE ACCOMADATED AND WELCOMED. Sadly that's not always the case in many Denver eateries. So it means a great deal to us. And the Fish Tacos & Flautas App freakin ROCKED !!!!,3
The food at Lime is a fun take on Mexican. The food is always good and the restaurant provides for an enjoyable atmosphere.,4
We went to Lime to celebrate my husband and my birthdays with our almost 2 year old and family. Everyone really enjoyed their meals and our cocktails were delicious. We were even offered the choice of dessert or tequila shots for our birthdays. It also was Christmas eve and we were sat with a beautiful view of the lights on the 16th Street Mall. Service was very attentive and the staff was great with our little one. Definitely give this place a shot and take advantage of $5 valet parking if you come after 5 PM.,4
"The old Lime of Larimer was much more romantic and the ambiance was much more enjoyable. Now it's in this huge place and makes it feel like you're in a warehouse. There was a holiday party going on and they were so loud that it kind of ruined our dinner. They don't give you the limes with the tequila anymore and their salsa has changed. It's fire-roasted and isn't spicy at all like it used to be; at least they didn't change their chips. My boyfriend ended up proposing after dinner downtown, so at least that made up for our experience! Our server was great but they did say that we ""didn't show up"" for our reservation with OpenTable. I think the hostesses were just lazy and didn't mark it.",3
"From the moment we walked in for our lunch reservation, we we treated with smiles and a welcoming staff. From the hostess to sat us, to our waitress to the busboy who said goodbye to us as we were leaving, I felt truly welcomed and appreciated. The food was great, the drink was really good too! I will be returning for certain when I am downtown!",4
"The food has really gone downhill.  My fish tasted like it was frozen,  rice was bland.",1
"When we got there, one of the first things that was said to us was ""there's a 2 hour wait for any food"".  They were turning others away and not being very friendly about it. Not the best first impression. 

The food was not great, it was pretty average. The drinks were pretty good- we got many drinks out of a pitcher which made us happy. 

It was VERY difficult to find the location at first. For people who are new to the Denver, better directions would've been helpful.",2
"The food wasn't bad, but the green chili was not at all spicy.  My chimichanga was supposed to be smothered; there was a little bit on the plate that the chimi was placed on top of.  
The menu clearly states that your first order of chips and salsa is complimentary and any additional are $2.00.  We were charged for the one and only provided.  
If you're looking for atmosphere and decent chips and salsa this is a great place.  If you're looking for good Mexican food, go someplace else.",1
"I had the 3 enchiladas and they let me mix and match.  They were all delicious!  We had a reservation and they still sat us in the bar, which was quite noisy at times.  Overall, it was a nice experience though.  We tried them out because they were in our Denver Dining Passbook.  I would definitely go back.",2
Fun drink menu. Nice view of downtown.,3
"The food is always exceptional.  It can be hit or miss with the staff where some are fantastic and others need a bit of help.  Every time my admin orders lunch to go, the sides are always different sizes no matter how often she orders.",3
"I have been to lime many times, they have great $1 tacos! This time though our service took FOREVER! It was over an hour to get our tacos so overall our ideally relatively quick meal took about two and a half hours.",3
"we were asked where we wanted to sit and chose a room. at 7:20 p.m .they closed that room down and cleaned and moved the chairs to the top of the tables, quite noisily. If they had been planning to do that, why did they not sit us in a different room where there were plenty of people and they were not closing soon? Someone needs to train this staff!!!!",2
"This is a great place to enjoy cocktails and great authentic food... We were visiting Denver and found this great gem to share a fun night out with friends. The people were friendly, and the food was fantastic. Amazing authentic chips and a salsa to die for... WOW... Great happy hour menu and just an all around great experience. THANKS",4
Loved the garage door like windows!,3
"You gotta love a place that sells $1 tacos all day on Tuesdays.  You get to choose corn, flour, crispy, chicken, ground beef, shredded beef, veggie -- lots of combinations.  And all for a buck!  Hello???  For $3 you can get fish or shrimp tacos.  They also have great service, super friendly and attentive!",4
"Marginal.  Not a place I would say ""Oh boy I need to go back there.""",1
"Ok, let me begin by saying that I was in charge of organizing a dinner for a group of 8 people in town for a meeting and I have never disappointed my colleagues. Until tonight!!!  We were seated promptly and our waiter took our drink orders promptly. So far, so good. It took a long time to get our drinks and when he returned, we were anxiously waiting to order appetizers, but he left us for over 10 minutes without returning. After we ordered and received multiple appetizers for the table (most which were meh- with the exception of the nachos with barbacoa), we were ready to order dinner. Again, waiter disappeared. Eventually took more drink orders and never came back with my second margarita. We had to flag him down to order dinner. After an over an hour there, our dinners arrived and my shrimp tacos were tiny. Still no drink... Also, we did not like the flour tortilla chips and our waiter offered corn. By the time they arrived, we were just about finished with dinner which was just ok. By the time we got our check, it was a 2 hour excruciating experience with loud music, inattentive service and less than average tasting food.  With all of the choices for great food in Denver, I was so surprised at how awful our experience was and will never return.",0
"We love LIME and the food here.  The wait staff was very good, but I rated the service lower because despite our on-time arrival and great seating, our reservation through Open Table was cancelled AFTER we arrived.  As a result, I did not get the Open Table points.  I am guessing that this restaurant will cancel your reservation even if you show up so that they will not have to pay a commission to Open Table.  This has happened to me before at another restaurant.  Watch out for bogus cancellations or you won't get your Open Table points.",3
I had the stuffed avocado.  Very unique dish with good flavor.  We ordered a pitcher of margaritas and it was light on the alcohol.,1
It was a Sunday afternoon in the restaurant was not very busy. Seems like an ideal location being on the third floor. They have two for one specials on Sunday.,3
"I like this restaurant.  The food is really good, the portions are more than enough to satisfy and the wait staff is always friendly. I always look forward to coming back the next time!",3
Lime is one of my favorite places to go for tacos. This is a place to check out.,4
"This place is fairly new and the location is neat. They have a nice view over 16th st  from the third floor with big garage doors they open often. The decor is modern and colorful. For me, that's where the interest ends. I work close by and I've been a few times since they opened. Each time I've been disappointed. The food is sub par and the service staff needs a boost. The servers have been kind and friendly but slow and inattentive. Their queso turned into a solid brick within minutes of reaching the table. It was just gross. Some sort of melted something that didn't look or taste like cheese. Unappealing. I called to make a reservation for happy hour and was told by the young girl on the phone that they are busy with lunch right now and to call back later or go to OpenTable. Being busy at lunch should be a bit more anticipated I would think.n She had enough time to tell me 3 times how busy they were but not enough time to help me with my small request. Telling a customer to call back later is less than ideal. Long story short, I've been a handful of times for happy hours and each time my impression, or lack of one, has been confirmed. I've worked in food service myself in the past and they simply need to step it up!",1
Our waitress took 45 minutes to deliver our check and then doubled our order (on the ticket) and argued with us over how much food we actually received.,1
We made a reservation through Open table.  When we arrived there at 5:45 they said they called and left a message (5:35PM) to let us know they had a private party and we could just be in the bar.   So we said fine but there were now seats in the bar and the hostess seemed very uninterested in accommodating us in any way.  We ended leaving and going to Maggiano's.   Quite sure we will never return and I have also heard negative comments since.,0
"The perfect place for a casual business lunch or to grab a quick and tasty bite to eat.  Service was fast and friendly.  The tacos, wow!  Don't let the price fool you.  They are filling and yummy.  It is the place to be seen.  Have been there 2x and the good was consistent.",4
"I did a reservation this time because Lime gets super busy on Tuesdays. It actually wasn't as busy as usual. We ordered our Tacos and a Margarita. They brought out the wrong amount of taco (less then what was ordered) and didn't bring the Margarita. By the time the waitress came back to us, it was 20 minutes later and we had ordered more tacos which we were given the wrong amount of tacos and type of tacos again. Overall, I love going to Lime. Especially for Taco Tuesday with my friends. I just hope I never ever get that same server again.",2
"Nice that they took reservations from Open Table.  We got there and heard people being told there was a 30 minute wait.  We were seated immediately.  It was a bit noisy due to Cinqo de Mayo.  But heck, it wouldn't be a good Mexican restaurant if they weren't celebrating.  Very good food and decent service for the price.",3
Celebrated a birthday and Cinco de Mayo at Lime. Great food and margaritas. We also enjoyed the mariachis for Cinco de Mayo.,4
"Our servers, Lauren and Kelsey, were amazing!! They were attentive and friendly!",4
"We had a bachelorette party on a Saturday at Lime; with a reservation.  Our waiter was actually great, but he was waiting on 2 large tables and didn't seem to have any help whatsoever so he was running all over.  I'm not sure why on a busy weekend you would not have had more staff helping out.

We had a large group but were given the excuse that the bill could not be divided up.  Every restaurant does this i found that to be very annoying.  2 of the guests did not even get their food, just an overall poor experience.  the Jalepeno Margs are also poorly made, not sure if they even had a bartender working.  We were looking forward to coming back for office parties etc and out of 17 girls i can say none of us would recommend, or come back to this establishment.  

Very disappointing.",1
"Waiter got 5 of 10 meals wrong, which is really scary considering he was obviously training a new waitres. The steak in the fajitas and burritos was tough and chewy.  This was a business dinner and the waiter gratted  me 20% for poor service and food. Very dissapointed. Oh he also forgot two meals when he brought the food.  And the queso is Aweful.",1
"Lime has great ""Mexirado"" food. I had the fish tacos and it was delish! Gauc is also fantastic and they have amazing mojitos. Great place to go for happy hour and also in warm weather when they open the windows and the live band is playing.",4
"The Hostess was smart, accomodating, friendly and polite. We had tacos and a chimichanga - both were very good. The margarita with the jalapeno was quite good. Other margaritas on the menu - not sure what their titles were - one was too sweet and the other way too tart. Overall a good meal! Our waiter was attentive and it was clear that he knew the menu very well.",3
"Chips are sooo good, but not healthy. Great food options and all have been good. Downtown new location is amazing! Can't wait for summer!",3
"Food was decent, service was terrible. With a restaurant full of empty tables there is no reason to pack couples into 2 person booths right on top of each other. My husband and I couldn't even hear each other tall because we were inches away from another couple. It was awkward and unnecessary to seat us so close together.",1
"Large lunch party with a lot of hiccups.  Food is always delicious, though...",1
"The shredded beef tacos are excellent!  I love this place, the ambiance is good, the energy is good and the decorating is very interesting.  When I've eaten at the bar the service has been beyond excellent.  When I've dined in the dinning room, well, the servers could certainly use some training.",2
Bailey was fabulous!   Best waitress I've had in a long time.,4
My friend had the chile rellenos and I had the southwest eggrolls.  WOW!  Both were fantastic!  The chipolte sauce on the eggrolls was soooo dang tasty!  Loved both dishes!  Very friendly service!,4
Decent Mexican food and margaritas. Roughly equivalent to Chili's.,2
"Great mexican / american food, we had a group of 10 on a Saturday night and service was perfect and attentive, everyone said their food was delicious, especially loved were the enchiladas and flour/corn mix of chips.  Salsa is delicious as well... highlight was tequila shots for dessert, they have a great tequila list, will definitely be back.",4
Service was good.  Made a dinner reservation and was put in the bar.  I didn't make a reservation for dinner to sit in the bar.  Food came out cold.,1
This was our first time eating at Lime. We will definitely be back!,4
Tequila!  We had a lunch group of 8 for taco Tuesday.  The tacos are always delicious.  The chips are melt in your mouth.  The salsa is fire roasted goodness.  My favorite drink is the CMF - like a mojito with cucumber vodka.  YUM.  We love this place.,4
"I had not been to Lime's new location at the Pavilions and I was so pleasantly surprised. It is a great space, great location. We had a table by the windows, which were open because it was such a lovely day. It was fantastic.

The service was a little slow, but the food was tasty and nicely presented.",3
"We had tickets to a show at the clock tower. Fast and friendly, Taco Tuesday was great. We parked underground walked to and from. It was flawless. OpenTable allow us to pick a place with a view. Great for groups",4
"We had reservations, and requested a table by the window wall overlooking the 16th St. Mall. When we got there, there were only 3 other parties, and we were told that we couldn't have a table by the window because there were other larger groups that had reservations.  We sat there for 5 minutes before we even saw a server. The food was nothing to write home about. The margaritas were over priced. When we left, the place was still empty, including all of the tables by the window that we requested.  I'm not going back.  There's way better Mexican food restaurants in Denver.",0
Food was not great.  We loved it when it was on Latimer.  Something's change.  This is one that I wish did not change.,3
"We really loved the Larimer location of Lime.  The new location in the Pavilions is a huge improvement.  Same style, more room, and just nicer overall.  We recently went to the new location for our 11th anniversary.  The hostess hand drew a ""happy 11th anniversary"" sign and had it over our table.  It was so nice (and thoughtful) we took it with us.  Tons of instagram likes on that one.  It was a great evening - food, service, atmosphere.  Just really great.  And the prices are incredibly reasonable for the quality of dining and experience.  Top notch for downtown Denver.",4
"food was pretty good, atmosphere was excellent, service was terrific. Would definitely come here again if in the area.",3
"Always good food, friendly staff and quick service, its one of my favorite Mexican restaurants downtown.  I had a combination of tacos (chicken, barbacoa and carnitas) which were good, but I wished they had a little more ""something"" to elevate them to a level that passes up the average taco.  With each bite, I was thinking the meat needed extra moisture or some type of sauce that made them melt in your mouth delicious.  I added lots of salsa and that made them very good.  Maybe even extra sour cream and guacomole would have done the trick.  The chili rellanos on other hand are SO good.  They are crispy, not greasy and the melted cheese inside is savory and makes you want keep eating - yum!",3
"A much better venue on the Mall versus the old location in the basement off of Larimer.  The food is very good as well as the service, but the location and view of the Mall is great.  Fun at the Pavilions.",3
Terrible place to have lunch when they are doing their special. Their waitress paid us no attention and took over 1.3 hours to get 9 tiny tacos out to us. Water NEVER refilled and we weren't even provided menus once we asked what Taco Tuesday entailed.  Horrible experience.,0
Loved the Frozen Mojito.  Dinner was delightful with my friends before off to our show.,2
"Place for groups, families, drinks...nice atmosphere...great service.",4
"Came here with some co-workers and thought we'd give it a shot as it was close to our hotel. The restaurant itself is very beautiful. This is where the good stuff ends. The waiter didn't have it together at all. You'll get better Mexican food in your local strip mall than you will here. The place has potential, but the ownership really needs to wake up and start making wholesale changes with the staff.",0
We always enjoy the food here; it has great flavors and we always look forward to coming back!,3
We were a group of out of towners and we enjoyed Lime!  They had plenty of room for our larger group.  Reservations were honored right on time.  Food was outstanding and service was great!  The Downtown Denver atmosphere was amazing!,4
"We were looking for a place to dine on a patio and this was nice, with the breeze blowing through the upstairs of the mall.  Good food, big portions.  Not a fan of their chips - they are homemade fried flour tortillas which tend to taste like donuts.  Friendly fun staff and the food came out quickly.",2
"This restaurant has an unusual 3rd-floor downtown shopping mall location, in a very busy and touristy part of Denver off 16th Street. Service is a bit uneven, with cordial but seemingly-preoccupied table staff, and a hostess who seemed undertrained. During our visit we were disappointed that the selection that we ordered was not exactly what the waiter delivered to the table. We were also puzzled as to why in a Mexican food setting, we received french fries with our order.  The food was tasty, but much higher in carbohydrates than one normally associates with Mexican-based cuisine.",2
"We were there with a group of 8 for lunch.  Our server was a little unorganized and we had asked him twice for the chips and salsa and finally asked the water girl who then brought only one bowl of each for a table of 8 so we had to ask for another one.  The food was good but not anything special.  It could use a little spicing up.  Everyone like their food but did not think anything was that great about it.  Our server got better once we were eating, he was more attentive then.  It is a nice looking restaurant, but I'm not too anxious to go back.",2
"We went to Lime on Saturday night for my bachelorette party.When we go there, they had us set up at two separate tables right in front of the DJ. When we asked to be moved, the hostess was incredibly gracious about moving us to a spot where were were all together, not right under the speakers. We were doing all sorts of games and stuff, so I didn't have a chance to touch my food until everyone else was pretty much done with theirs. Once I did, I noticed that my veggie tamales were packed with meat, which I don't eat. I politely asked the server about it when she came around and her response was to look at me and say,""Well, I guess you will be getting drunk really fast tonight, huh?"" Aaannd...that was it. Fail, fail, FAIL. Never going back.",2
"Food was tasty, service was attentive, margaritas were great.  Definitely would return.",4
"The food is delicious, the atmosphere is fun and spacious.  It seems they need to hire more servers or kitchen staff for lunch time.  I've been there twice for lunch and both times the service was slow.  This last time we were there an hour between ordering and our main course arriving.  We did have some appetizers but even that took about 30 minutes.  I will go back because I do enjoy the menu I just can't go there if I'm on a strict schedule.",3
"With Denver's weather (hello?  Mother's Day snow storm!), they really planned this place right!  I love how open or closed it can be.  Service is great, food is awesome, love the margaritas!",4
"We were one of about 3 groups of people in the restaurant, and our service was not great.  The main server seemed very uninterested, the people who brought the food out had no idea what food they had and were offering up to our table.  For example, one of them handed me a burrito and said ""barbacoa burrito"" and I responded that I had ordered the carnitas burrito, to which he replied, ""Oh ok, yes that is carnitas.""  Doesn't instill a lot of confidence.  The food was good, nothing amazing, but everyone seemed happy with their meals.

They had America's Funniest Home Videos playing in the bar (they sat us at a table in the bar area).  It was distracting and seemed like a weird thing to have playing in a bar.",2
"The service was underperformed only by the food. There's a reason this place has moved from larimer to the pavilions (something we did not realize). Multiple dishes (fish tacos, anything with shredded chicken) came out looking like cat food. There were drunk 60 year old dancing obnoxiously next to our table and breaking glasses. The service was some of the worst I've experienced. They never once cleared a plate or a glass unless we pointedly handed it to them, at which time we were met with a scowl. Do not go here, tell all your friends not to go here.",0
"My friends and I came out to celebrate Cinco de Mayo. Our server was wear a really cute Cinco de Mayo hat, and when I commented how adorable her hat was. As she returned with our drinks, she had actually brought me one of the hats. That was so nice of her to do!! We then headed over to the free photo booth and took some fun pics!!!! Thank u for a memorable, great food, and tons of laughs evening üåü",4
I went to this restaurant while in town for a convention.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgable. The food was delicious and the home made tortilla chips were to die for!!!,4
"This place is awesome!  Great ambiance!  It's a bit pricey for lunch, but their happy hour specials and Taco Tuesday ($1 and same size as normal taco) are well worth it!  Looking forward to summer at Lime!",4
Horrible service. Rude waitress. I know it's a cheap evening with $1 tacos. Ordered drinks they were wrong and nasty. I never write reviews but such a bad experience,0
Food was sub par and service not great.  What a waste of a nice location.,2
"Good food, quick service, great margaritas and a short walk to the theaters made this a perfect pre-show option for our group of 4.",3
"The tacos for taco Tuesday were good and filling,but it took almost an hour to get our food. Don't go if you're in a hurry. There were 9 of us, but we all ordered just tacos. The manager came over and apologized but did nothing about it.  We had to take our food to go because it took so long to get it",1
"We came in for lunch the other day and unfortunately, didn't have the kind of experience that made us want to come back.  We got the wrong drinks and the server forgot our appetizer order.  Lunch was good, but the server never asked if we wanted a second round of drinks.  She just brought our check before we had even finished eating.  Unfortuantely we were celebrating and would have liked a long lunch.  We sat at our empty table for 45 minutes after paying our bill  (from 12:45-1:30, not like it was the middle of the afternoon and they were closed) and never had anyone stop by and ask if we wanted anything else. They certainly weren't too busy, as the place was mostly empty.  Hope that they work out the kinks.",1
"We made a reservation, but when we got there it was pretty empty.  Oh, and they didn't mark down that we honored our reservation so I received an email from Open table asking why I didn't honor my reservation.  The food was okay.  One thing that bothered me was that staff kept coming to see if we were okay, every 10 minutes.  Part of the problem could've been that our waiter was a trainee.  One good thing, they were very accommodating in regards to breaking up our check for different payments.  I don't live in Denver, but if I did, I'm not sure I'd go back.",1
We really enjoyed the $1 tacos for lunch on St. Patricks Day!,4
"We wanted to have a nice dinner before going out for my to be sister in laws bachelorette party. The staff was quick to get us drinks, chips, appetizers and even dinner. The staff was fun and professional. I would recommend this place for any event of a nice dinner with friends or family. Great service,great food, great atmosphere!",4
"I have visited this location twice, I was hoping the bad experience the first time was a fluke. Both visits were a huge disappointment. The service is slow, there was only one waitress. The food is mediocre. On both visits, I have left with the impression that this restaurant is either run by a group who doesn't know what they are doing or that they just don't care.",0
"We had a 6oth birthday celebration downtown on Saturday night. Parking underground, enter on Welton Street, an elevator ride to the restaurant. It was a great experience so yummy and the staff was so friendly. A free shuttle ride to a show at the Clock Tower and another free shuttle ride back to the Pavilions. So perfect for everyone in our crowd. Thank you Open Table for the ease in making reservations. Next stop the Queen Mary in Long Beach. You guys ROCK!",4
"Delicious, as always. I love this place!",3
"We originally went here because of 5280, but ended up not even using that menu. We had always wanted to try Lime, so this was our chance. My husband and I enjoyed our entrees, and I loved how nice everyone was to my four year old daughter. Even though she was the only kid in the restaurant at the time, no one looked down on us for having her with us, which has happened at other restaurants. I loved the music playing and would recommend this place to anyone looking for some good Mexican food and a fun time.",4
This is a favorite lunch spot now and each time we look forward to coming back again!,3
"My wife and I decided to visit Lime based on a positive recommendation from Scott. The food was good (not universally great). We visited Lime on a Saturday night at 6:30 PM and business was pretty slow. The greeters sat our table right in front of the kitchen door. On a busy night, I would not mind listening to people yell ""corner"" every few minutes, but on a slow night that table should have been the last one seated.",3
"This is one of my new favorite restaurants downtown. The food is awesome. My only recommendation would be that they strive to be little more attentive to working customers who need to get in and out quickly so that they are within their alloted one hour lunch break. The food is served quickly, hot and always fresh, but each time I have had to ask for the check so we could pay and get back to work. I have been late getting back each time we go, so I will try to remember to ask them to have the check ready after the food is served.",3
"had a sizeable group for lunch. The place was nearly empty but even so, we rarely saw our waitperson. Service was very slow and inattentive. Food once it finally came was less than good (personally I'd stay away from the ribs). Very disappointed as I had been to other Lime's many times and generally had very good food. Based on what I saw, this place won't last long. Too bad, it's a good location and a good idea for downtown eatery, especially when summer comes and they can open garage doors.",0
Tasty meal and fast service make this a great place to stop for a bite before a performance. The noise level and choice of music would not make it a romantic destination or a place to linger.,3
Service was extremely slow and no management seemed to be available on the floor to take care of the problem. Food took more than an hour to get out after waiting a long time to even order.,0
"My first time here and I will be back. The food was very good the restaurant has a good atmosphere. The homemade chips and salsa were great and the fajita and taco salads were fresh and really good. The only drawback was that the service was a little slow. Hopefully that improves to work better with their ""working"" customers who only have an hour for lunch. I am looking forward to trying other items on their menu.",3
"We waited for our food for over an hour, and when we tried to find our waitress she was no where to be found. She seemed to be avoiding us as she knew our wait was rediculous.",1
This restaurant is closed! Why does open table even let you book/confirm. Ruined our work Christmas meal plans.,0
Turned up for a booking made today boy to find out the restaurant had closed down!!!!,0
"If I could rate this a zero, I would. Booked this restaurant to celebrate my 7th Anniversary with my partner. I had an email 1 day prior to the booking to confirm that I am still coming. Upon arriving at the restaurant we saw the restaurant was closed for maintenance, we was confused at first then the disappointment and dissatisfaction kicked in when we realised we had spent hours getting ready and drove there for nothing. There was no email to inform me of the closure, there was no information on the website, Google stated the restaurant was open when it clearly wasn‚Äôt, no one had contacted me etc. Why was I allowed to book if the restaurant was closed??? It makes no sense and is inexcusable. I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if this doesn‚Äôt reopen because after seeing some of the reviews online I‚Äôm thinking I may have actually dodged a bullet with this one. Atrociously run restaurant, back to liquidation for Bourgee.",0
"Booked a table for my sons, 18th birthday, drove 2 1/2 hours for the restaurant to be closed and not a phone call or an email telling me",0
TRAVELLED 3 hours to get here for the Resturant to be closed with no notifications!!,0
"Absolutely appalling, manager was embarrassing arguing with customers while people are trying to have a meal, staff all look like they don't want to be there just standing around looking miserable. My partner had his drink knocked over him while being placed on the table and he didn't even get given a replacement they just left his half empty drink and come over with a small tissue overall very embarrassing and I can see this restaurant being here for much longer with the staff and management things need to change. And this isn't the only complaint there will be alot as everyone in the restaurant felt the same, shocking evening we just got up and left before our mains arrived!!",0
"Probably the worst restaurant experience ever. Fiod cold, staff taking ages to bring drinks, they do not know their menu, don't know how to switch lights and heater on. Forgot daughters meal, she started to cry. Horrible experience. Never ever coming there again.",0
Appears new. Staff are still a bit all over the place. Plates etc are very heavy and staff can‚Äôt hold them easily making everything look worrying at times. Manager was having a go at waitress right by our table which made us feel a bit awkward. Food was spot on though.,3
When we walked in we were told they weren't taking any walk ins this was at 20:00 but we told them we had a booking. We were then seated and waited an hour and a half for our starter. We had to wait 45 minutes for our drinks. We over heard the chief saying he was taking no more orders even though it was 21:00 and the restaurant didn‚Äôt close until 23:00. Maybe they need more staff or to close earlier. I felt sorry for the waitresses having to deal with turning customers away even though the restaurant was empty. Food was not worth the money either won‚Äôt be returning.,0
"The staff did not seem to know what they were doing, brought the food out when the food wasn't ready e.g. brought out a burger but only the buns! We told staff we were waiting for additional people to arrive but was approached every 5 minutes to ask if we was ready to order food yet. Was given a menu that we couldn't order off of as it was a Sunday menu, we went on a Friday. 

Overall wouldn't recommend. Food was OK, staff didn't seem to know what they were doing and had to wait ages for the bill, in the end we got up and paid at the bar.",1
"Awful, just awful. All staff on their phones, hardly any items on the menu were available and place was empty. We walked out without ordering food. Nearly ruined my sons birthday",0
I would give zero stars for everything if I could. We booked a table for a Tuesday got confirmation our table was booked then turned up and it was closed. No one called to cancel our reservation or let us know they wouldn‚Äôt be open. Terrible customer experience. Don‚Äôt waste your time going here go somewhere else.,0
"Booked for my 40th birthday. Received the booking confirmation, drove an hour to be there, only for it to be closed. Was my favourite restaurant but I won‚Äôt be going again.",0
"Empty when we got there. One waitress very friendly and took our orders. As it was quiet we could hear all conversations between staff in and out of kitchen. Which was fine . After a while we noticed we could hear who we could think was the manager, who sounded very belittling to the waitress. Kept talking very loudly to her which was unnecessary when only one table .We were out numbered of staff to customers, the conversations could have been done a lot quieter and actually could of come and helped the waitress. 
There was a time when someone dinged the bell to get the waitress to get them blue towel or a drink. When there was other staff around, the waitress was trying to do the ordering on the system .That she was clearly struggling with and rather then showing her they kept telling her she hasnt done it.

There was another time when the waitress went to serve some people who were looking at the menu so she was looking to get them seated. The chef/manager shouted service and dinged the bell to serve the food. Personally making it look very un professional.

The beef roast was okay. The nutroast wasn't cooked it was served stone cold. When we brought to the attention of chef, offered free drink which we refused. After checking the temperature by sticking finger in middle. They poured hot gravy over. And was told let them know we are trying our best. Which would be appreciated if it was a busy day. But it was empty that day. We over heard the manager say she's psycho keeps staring at me ,can't believe they're complaining.

So overall very dissapointing experience ,i had been in February and had a completely different experience. Which was why i recommended coming again. Unfortunately won't be coming back or recommending again.",0
"Avoid at all cost. Walked out as the food was terrible and service was crap. Wasn‚Äôt the only table to walk out either. Way to over priced, go Miller & Carter and get a decent meal for cheaper",0
"The food tasted terrible, the steak tasted like it had been bathed in salt. Left over plates was left on the table. Staff was just sitting behind the bar. Waitress come over eatting food in her mouth.",0
"The restaurant was very quiet. Food was ok, but very pricey. The restaurant was not clean and the covers, cutlery and glasses were very dirty, had to change a few of them. Will not go again.",1
"Ordered a starter and a main for me and wife, after 45 minutes the food came out. Unfortunately it was the main meal, we hadn't even had our starter. Won't ever go back there and we won't be recommending your restaurant to any of our friends.",0
"Service was terrible .ordered sparkling water when I got there and waited nearly 30 mins until I finally got it .ordered a grey goose cocktail and they kept getting it wrong .They kept just brining me grey goose and Ice .Finally got my drink right after 3rd attempt .Waited nearly an hour and half to finally get my cocktail.My friend ordered a large glass of red wine and they brought her the whole bottle.The waiters were slow and did not even check on us or ask if we were ready to order .We had to call them and ask if we could order and ask for any extras needed .After speaking to one of the waiters telling them how bad service was.They said all the waiters in the restaurant are new and longest one had been there for 3 months .it made sense because they all seem confused .The restaurant is vey nice and has a lot of potential but the staff will definitely
Run it down if it continues like this .I will not be going back .It was a terrible experience .",0
"Steak was Great , best I‚Äôve had in a while . Nice venue",4
Service was awful was sat down for half an hour and no one had bothered to come and take our drinks order when there was only 3 other tables in there. They have more interest talking to each other and serving there staff food definitely won‚Äôt be going back,0
Good quality and choice of food. Staff friendly and professional,4
"We managed to order our food and drinks after waiting 15 mins, then we were waiting 35mins to only get 1 drink given to us which wasn't correct. Unfortunately we had to leave the restaurant, the service was extremely slow.",0
we do not get out very much given the financial situation so to treat ourselves to a night out somewhere expensive is important so to have a bad experience was disappointing. we visited the Bourgee in Chelmsford and had a lovely experience so wanted to try Lakeside expecting the same kind of service however unfortunately the lobster was inedible (there was no meat inside the lobster at all which makes me think they gave me someone elses leftovers!) we also ordered a tomahawk to share which isnt cheap and it was not presented in the way youd expect for an expensive meat and asked for medium to well done specifying no blood for it to be swimming in blood (my partner had to mop hes plate up with a napkin) and cold. we asked for it to be cooked further which they did however came back no better still cold. it was not edible. they apologised and offered 25% off which we excepted as to not make a fuss however we went home hungry and not feeling very happy about the experience and out of pocket. the cocktails were lovely and the waitresses were nice and polite. we cannot recommend this to anyone and we would not be returning which is a shame.,1
"We were sat down on a table at 7pm, not once did a member of staff come over to take our order for food or drinks, and we weren‚Äôt given a drinks menu. After 40 minutes we left.",0
"Once we was seated we then didn't see the waitress for atleast half hour, before she come back and took our order. food was okay but there was a few minor things wrong. wrong sides/sauces etc and peoples steak wasnt cooked how they asked for it to be.",0
The food was cold when it arrived. Took an hour and 30 minutes for the main to arrive. Overall wasnt great,2
"Food was lovely, had steak, fries, mushrooms cauliflower cheese, & honey carrots. All very nice. Only fault was is was chilly in there. A bit pricey, so I'd say for special occasions only. For 2 of us it came to ¬£85.",3
"Went for a birthday meal
Evidently they have a staffing problem which is feeding into some reviews we have seen and certain tables appeared to have issues with trine it was taking to get served. I felt for the waiting staff as they were receiving the brunt of the complaints.
We did have to reorder drinks plus one of the starters wasn‚Äôt taken correctly but was rectified pretty quickly
Also we really wanted lobster but they had none and were only told once we sat down. Would have been good to get an email prior
I had steak and son had burger
Whilst steak was ok I have had much better ones. It was also cut through multiple times which is unusual 
Sides were good and chips also
This could be a really nice place but evidently it needs to address the staffing issues. Unfortunate people do look at reviews and the issues are feeding into them far too often now
The waitress who served us was lovely",2
"We left before our drinks arrived. Took them 30 minutes to take our drinks and just before it got to an hour we decided to leave! There was food waiting in the kitchen and no one moving it, no lobster and very rude waiter! Never returning",0
"We say there for 40 minutes before getting served! Not waitress fault just only two staff and one chef or shouldn‚Äôt even be open untill more staff! One family walked out! I even got up to see if any restaurants were open outside but when I came back the waitress was finally at our table‚Äô 
My steak was drenched soaked in garlic I love garlic but not that much and it was cold! We went else where for dessert as would have been in there till midnight! My husbands food was all cold too",0
"For a restaurant that prides themselves on offering a premium dining experience, from the outset I struggled to see anything premium about the service that I experienced. I booked Bourgee as a surprise for my boyfriends birthday. I wouldn‚Äôt bother booking in future, as no one was there to greet us when we arrived and they didn‚Äôt check my booking. It took the waitress 15 minutes to take our drinks order and then it took another 15 minutes for us to actually receive our drinks. I would understand the wait if the restaurant was busy but there were only 7 tables occupied. When the waiting staff eventually took our order we were notified that we were unable to order lobster as they had run out, which was very disappointing considering this was a steak AND lobster restaurant. On several occasions we had to ask the waiting staff to clear our table, at one point we had 6 pint glasses on our table, in the end my boyfriend and another guest we were with took them to the bar. 2 hours after being at the restaurant we received our meals. My boyfriend and I ordered a Tomahawk to share, we asked for it to be cooked Medium Rare and when it arrived the Steak was more Blue than what we had asked. It was extremely disappointing considering we had waited 2 hours. Unfortunately the steak was so undercooked I was unable to eat it. There is a lot that needs to be improved to this restaurant, the service is absolutely shocking and unfortunately the food for me was not much better. For the price it cost me and my friends, we could have booked a lovely restaurant in London, where we would have been guaranteed a premium experience - something Bourgee severely lacks!  I certainly will not be rushing back and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this restaurant to anyone else.",1
"The place never had enough staff, we see signs in the window going in, food took well over an hour to arrive, half the items on the menu was out of stock, the bill was still very expensive considering item were missing due to being out of stock, this meal was for a 40th birthday so very disappointed, I would never recommend and I certainly won‚Äôt be going back there",0
My birthday but it was horrendous. Take the reviews seriously,1
"Borgee's has a small selection of dishes on their menu which constitute of lobster and steak.  However, lobster is often not available and dishes that contain lobster as a starter aren't also available. That therefore limit your option. Otherwise the had a good service abd the chef made the effort to add prawns to the lobster starter dish I wanted to have since they didn't have it. Steak filet was delicious the peppercorn sauce wasn't the best I have eaten. Cocktails were good.",2
Half of the menu was not available due to a late delivery of food. So it was not a great first impression,1
"Good Service, Rubbish Food hardly had any thing I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anybody if I am honest",0
The service wasn‚Äôt great some of the staff clearly didn‚Äôt want to be there. The food was ok except it wasn‚Äôt hot just under warm. Expected a lot more,2
"Unfortunately the meal was not good at all. My husband asked for medium steak which came out more then well done, and they also forgot the two sides we ordered. We waited for over 30 mins for the new steak and sides to be brought over, which meant that I had finished my dinner as it would have gone cold. Steak was still not great, and the sides were cold which was a shame so we could not eat them. Staff were very friendly but unfortunately will not be going back.",0
"Took my Nan here for their Sunday roast dinner and was so disappointed. 
The roast potatoes were hard and pale - just basically like a boiled potato that had barely ever seen an oven. Steak was pure gristle. The only nice bit was the Yorkshire which tasted like it was pre bought aunt Bessie‚Äôs! 
Extremely disappointed. Should have gone to McDonald‚Äôs, would have had a nicer meal there!",0
The food was amazing and the staff very welcoming. I would recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.,4
Didn‚Äôt have vegetables and didn‚Äôt have milk for coffee,1
This was our first visit to Bourgee for our one year anniversary. Our waitress was absolutely delightful and very helpful with a couple of question we had on the menu. I ordered the lobster bonbons and wagyu beef and my partner the prawns and a Bourgee burger and we were both extremely happy with the quality of food. I loved every bit of my food and found it absolutely delicious! The value for money is very decent and would definitely recommend! We will be returning.,4
"Starters were lovely, roast was not! Asked for medium rare and it came well done. Advertised as slices of roast beef but it was actually a cheap beef steak which had consistency of liver and to top it off was served in a cheap microwave Yorkshire with frozen veg mix! Ordered cauli cheese as a side and the portion size was laughable, it barely covered the bottom of the 3 inch dish! Staff haven‚Äôt really been trained properly, lots of standing around chatting rather than serving the few customers there was. It‚Äôs a shame as I ate in the Southend branch many many years ago which was nice but no wonder this place is always empty‚Ä¶",1
"Disappointed with our visit, won‚Äôt be going back in a hurry, service was ok. Our food come out with so much liquid on the plate, our food felt like it was swimming in it, however it was ok to eat, just a nuisance. It felt like too much effort to send it back. We then had to listen to a loud conversation between staff which just sounded aggressive and abusive about their work life within the place, then for a drink pair to be loud and have no courtesy for other diners wanting one shot from the bar. Considering the place was practically empty, staff didn‚Äôt really take much interest in clearing away other tables or clearing our own when needed.  Young members of staff that I feel could do with more training.",2
"Where do I start.. booked a table (don‚Äôt bother) walked in no one to greet us to take our booking, waitress/waiters walking passed us, walked up to the bar & hung around, eventually someone came to us didn‚Äôt bother with our names & seated us.  The food made up for the very bad service throughout our stay.  Young waitresses looked & acted as no experience no training given. 1 waitress walked around with no enthusiasm & brought us someone else‚Äôs meal, was like a robot and obviously not happy to be there. Another waitress practically threw out meal on the table spilling chips from the bowl then telling us ooo that was hot opps sorry spilt on the table‚Äù then left.  The edges of plate was covered in melted butter or oil from the food I don‚Äôt suspect the chef did not clean the plate but more like the sloppy hand waitress that served us managed to make this mess.  We also witnessed a few more un happy customers with the service and spilling and dropping other customers cutlery or dishes. It was like watching a comedy sketch. This was at Thurrock lakeside.  1 waitress was also not dressed for the part but someone who would be waiting on a street corner or going to a nightclub. Another older waitress was frustrated & apologies for the incompetence of the other waitresses however I thought she could have been more professional and all waitresses should be dressed smarter even if they wore a pinny like 1 waitress had in made her look smarter and the part. All I can say is thank for the food was amazing.",1
"The service was so slow we ended up eating our dinner 2 hours after getting there and it came up wrong, sides were missing. I ordered bread at the start that took half hour to get to me and when it came it was 2 tiny circle rolls (there were 4 of us) ended up call the manager over, would not return.",0
Awful!!! Terrible soft shell crab burger. Couldn‚Äôt pour a pint. Won‚Äôt see me again.,0
"Lunch with friend before collecting my wedding dress.

The lady serving is outside was amazing. 
She was polite, smiley, knowledgeable and extremely attentive.

We chose the 2 course lunch menu which was incredible value and the food was amazing.

Would highly recommend x",4
My second time visting Bourgee and first time having the Roast which was absolutely delicious.,4
"Food is really good, the staff not so much.

Our first waitress disappeared after we asked for tap water when a bottle was brought to to table. The second waiter didn‚Äôt seem to know what day it was or what was on the menu.

Later on in the evening, for some reason music was just blasted and we felt like we were in a club and couldn‚Äôt even hear each other any more.

As said before food was excellent but the service needs a lot of improvement to get people to return",1
"I ordered a filet steak and you covered it in garlic, the meat was poor quality and the mash was disgusting. You made us wait 25 mins for a top up on a drink, the service was disappointing. And out of all the tables spare you put a young couple with no child next to a family with child! Use your heads for this matter. First and last experience with this restaurant.",0
"The food quality wasn‚Äôt as high as the prices. As a table of 4 who love steak, the taste or tenderness of the steak matched the price we paid. 
Very overpriced and disappointed. Will not be returning.",2
Service was poor food was over cooked and not value for money.,0
"Lovely spot for an outside or inside lunch / dinner. Good menu but didn't quite impress us on taste. Steak sauces in need of improvement. Mac n cheese / dauphinoise potatoes were very tasty. Lovely espresso martini. Waitresses very attentive and lovely. Long wait for mains - believe they forgot about us! 
If the food improves, I would go again!",2
"The food just wasn‚Äôt good and wasn‚Äôt worth the price. It was tasteless and for some dishes, poorly presented. Really wasn‚Äôt worth the money.",1
Food was poor and elements missing from dishes and service was shocking. Only nice thing was the birthday guest getting a little chocolate board and drink.,1
"Nothing  ‚ÄòLuxe ‚Äò about this place. Staff very friendly but seem Inexperienced. Food service takes far too long to come out of the kitchen. And definitely not fine dining when it does come out.Sadly, would not return or recommend",0
Didn‚Äôt cook the steaks to what we had asked. When sent back they came back with cold chips and sauce that had a skin on.,2
"This was our first visit to bourgee lakeside after looking forward to the food due to the lovely decor both inside and out, however when we arrived we wasn‚Äôt even offered a drinks  or food menu. The waitress come to take our order 15 minutes after we sat down in which I said we haven‚Äôt had a menu yet which took another 10 minutes. 
We ordered our food and bread for teaser, the bread took 40 minutes to come where I then had to ask if it was coming. Again we waited while the waitress checked for another 10 minutes leaving us waiting for 50 minutes for some bread! 

When our food arrived the fries were cold and dauphinois where cold in the middle and warm on the outside, even tho the waitress told us to mind the skillet because it is piping hot ( which it was) meaning this food was microwaved, i then ask this to be remade as it was unreadable!

This service was very poor in my opinion as the was like then 10 tables to service in the restaurant and there was 3/4 waitresses, our visit took 2.5 hours when we only ordered teasers and mains! I will not be returning",0
the worse restaurant i have been to in many years would not take  a dog  there,0
"Steak was best I‚Äôve had , spoke with lady chef to pass on to chef who cooked as food was best I‚Äôve had in ages ! Waitresses little inexperienced but they did an ok job . 
Place looked good but paper napkins let it down 
Overall I would go back for the food",4
"We had an amazing time at Burgee on Friday celebrating our son‚Äôs graduation. This was mainly due to the ambiance and the fantastic service we received!
Service was the best. Unfortunately we dis not take the waitresses‚Äô name, but she was fantastic and made sure we were looked after.
She even went the extra mile and presented our son‚Äôs desert with a ‚ÄúCongratulations ‚Äú message! Thank you!
Unfortunately the food was not at the level we expected for the price paid. The starters though were very nice, but I am afraid I can‚Äôt say the same for the mains.
The soup was extremely hot and all you could taste was a burning mouth.
The beef was quite chewy.
The flower pot desert was well presented but the ice cream felt of the cheap brand.
For that reason I have given a 4 star for the overall experience.
Once the food matches the service, we will surely revisit.",3
"Great lunch.  Quality hot food and lovely staff , will return",4
"Friendly staff, food nice. Very good customer service and approachable blonde manager.",4
"Service was awful. Felt rushed from the beginning. They had a huge party in so suggested we order before them which I understand but they asked us if we were ready to order every minute until we did. 

I ordered a gin which they didn‚Äôt have.

They bought our starter out and then 2 seconds later tried to bring our main out which we said no too so guessing that stayed in the kitchen until we were ready as was cold!

No ambience in there, felt rushed the whole time. Food was ok but absolutely not worth the money.  Was in and out of there in just over an hour which was disappointing as was a date night out.

Thoroughly disappointed and won‚Äôt go again",1
"One of the worse customer service experiences I have ever seen, I had a table booked for my partners birthday, when we arrived we were simply told ‚Äòno walk ins today‚Äô (in an empty restaurant) when I explained we had a booking for a birthday celebration.. was ignored and reeteqdly told no walk ins.. when they finally listened to the fact I had a booking then they said they where no longer serving food as they didn‚Äôt have a chef. No phone call prior to us arriving. No apology. No customer service at all. Avoid at all costs.",0
"No lobster in a lobster restaurant ( the main reason we booked was for the lobster ‚Ä¶ 
Service very poor ‚Ä¶ food very mediocre .., 
One starter took off the bill as it was disgusting .. shame as I booked this to celebrate my daughters birthday .,, wobbly table .. given a napkin by waitress and told to stick it under the leg to stop wobble .. empty restaurant when others surrounding were heaving ‚Ä¶. Will not return ‚Ä¶ ¬£100 bill for very sub standard food and service",0
I went for my birthday. The steak was amazing.,2
"Service little slow at times . But food was tasty hot and quick and the steak was seasoned perfectly . Chef looked busy but was doing a great job . Venue looked nice but needed a few extra touches to neaten the place up . 
Overall a great Saturday meal with family and will return with partner",4
"Waited ten minutes to get served,  the food was cold, the lettuce was brown , hardly any lobster on my dish. Waited for salt and pepper,  waited for the tool to crack out lobster claw , 
I was really excited to eat hear but really disappointed.",0
"Food tasted great, but the fillet steak arrived cut in half (??) and was cold so had to be sent back, it returned lukewarm. Sugar snap peas were literally swimming in butter and hadn't been de-strung, so a bit chewy. Weren't given proper tools for lobster (no thin forks to dig into claws), or bibs/napkins, so the process was messy and didn't feel we'd got all the meat out of the claws (which is a bit frustrating when you're paying that much money for a small amount of meat delicacy!) Service was also pretty slow despite the place being half empty. Staff were very pleasant though and flavours were good, so we still enjoyed the meal, but felt it wasn't worth the fairly high cost due to the above. Also disappointed with the desserts - lobster for main, then mars bar cheesecake or donuts for dessert??",2
Steak was amazing and venue was nice,4
Food took absolutely ages to come out even tho the restaurant was empty. Asked for medium steak and it can well done. The next attempt was rare. Some of the food that came to the table was unrecognisable to the description of food in the menu. The bun on my burger was hard and generally the food was disappointing. Would not go back,1
"Celebrated my husband‚Äôs birthday here with our two children aged 8 and 11 years.
Food was very delicious and a good menu selection though there could be more options for children.

My husband was given a complimentary glass of bubbles and a mini dessert plate to congratulate him on his birthday that was kindly gifted by the restaurant.

We would definitely revisit as staff were very friendly and helpful.",3
The food and service was incredible. Lobster tasty and huge,4
i would give 0 stars if i could. To summarise a long story properly the worst meal i have ever eaten.,0
The most incredible food I got so far around Lakeside. We been there first time but service and atmosphere is completely brilliant even some of seems look really young. I definitely recommend for you!,4
"Best steak I‚Äôve had in years , food was amazing . Service nice and good choice of cocktails",4
"We was left waiting for food for ages, half our order was wrong or they‚Äôd ‚Äúrun out‚Äù of what we‚Äôd ordered. Wouldn‚Äôt mind if this was just one thing but it was half of our meal. 

We‚Äôd been in the restaurant over an hour before our mains arrived. We‚Äôd ordered starters, one of these came out completely wrong, but we didn‚Äôt realise until we was already eaten half of it (was covered in sauce, was supposed to have lobster in, assumed it would be under the sauce somewhere- it wasnt, so guess it was the wrong dish). Still nice though so didn‚Äôt complain. 
Mains came out, one of our side sauces was totally wrong. We‚Äôd ordered 5 sides, two of which were garlic mushrooms, and one lot of carrots. When it was served we were told they only had one lot of mushrooms left, so they were giving us two lots of carrots instead. The carrots were left uneaten. 
Was very disappointing. 
Our daughter had ice cream as her meal, the menu stated vanilla ice cream. We waited over 20 minutes for the ice cream to be brought out (in a reasonably empty restaurant, I‚Äôll add) to be told they have run out of vanilla so here‚Äôs pistachio instead. Wasn‚Äôt great service just seemed very slow and like everything was wrong or sold out.",1
"The service on Father‚Äôs Day was really poor!! And they was not busy. 

The menu is very misleading, in terms of how the food will be presented! 

Limited selection of Alcohol available",1
"Was told as soon as we arrived food would take at least 45 mins as the kitchen had just opened. Got bread rolls but they had no butter, steak wasn't cooked to request and was questioned to check I was driving when I ordered a small glass of wine!",1
"Not enough food choices , waitress was rough and not very approachable .",1
I just received this email from open table to confirm I was seated which is a lie! They were shut by the time I got there . Bare in mind my booking was at 6.45 and they close at 11. Absolutely pathetic,0
"Waited nearly an hour for our main course even though the restaurant was almost empty. When we pointed this out to the Manager she had the audacity to be rude. I will never go to this venue again. 

We went next door to Cocoa Asia the following week and had a fabulous experience.",0
"Absolutely rubbish ! We got there at 6:15 and we booked for 6pm. On the site it says they give you 15 mins grabs if you‚Äôre late which we was only 15 mins , when we got there they said they‚Äôre closed because we‚Äôre late after on their site it says we get 15 mins grace. Never again !!!!!",0
The staff was disgusting and their behaviour was terrible would recommend for nobody to ever go there they were so rude was a joke food was disgusting get better in McDonald‚Äôs,0
"Unwelcoming greeting, service so poor that we left before even ordering food. Would not recommend",0
"Food was excellent. Came out very quickly which took away from the experience a little bit as felt slightly rushed.

Staff were good.",4
"Was not welcomed into the restaurant, stood at the entrance trying to catch the eye of one the many staff. Then told to sit where ever I wanted. 

Managed to get  1 drink the entire evening (restaurant was very quiet) and was never asked if we would like another. 

Toilets were terrible with flooding in the mens.

Food was average/good but overpriced. 

If a meal for 2 comes to ¬£150 with a single drink each, I‚Äôd expect to have good service at a minimum.",1
"Staff were terrible, apart from one waitress, the manager was miserable and unhelpful. This was the 3rd time that we had tried to eat here due to 2 prior problems. The first time they had no gas to cook with, the second time they we closed without notice and the website stated they were open, and this time they had no chef only trainee. Will not be coming again, we managed to get in and eat due to my husband stating we would come in for drinks and wait for the food. if the manager would have been more polite and offered a solution such as booking us for another day or even offering an apology we would come again , due to how unbothered and rude she was we will not be retuning unfortunately.",1
"Went on a weekday and it was quite quiet although a nice view of the lake and people watching. Service could have been slightly better but ok, food was delicious",3
Never had an experience like it waiters was so ingronet and didnt want to help or take orders waited 40 mns for a drink food was disgusting had to be sent back twice over priced cheap food will never go agin place sould be shut down,0
"Service really let it down‚Ä¶ about 7 different people serving our table and was asked on two separate occasions for our order when already given to another server. Glasses came out dirty, asked for tap water for table got 2 glasses and had to ask 2 different people for glasses for the rest of us. The food was disappointing for the price‚Ä¶ they forgot one of our meals - granted they did take it off the bill but overall not a positive experience and it‚Äôs a shame as it‚Äôs a nice restaurant so could be really lovely, just not really good enough with the prices they charge",2
"The food was nice when. It eventually arrived, but one drinks menu between 3 tables, 20 mins wait for drinks. We we offered water that never came. I wouldn‚Äôt rush back",2
"It was lovely diner with my friends on my husband 35th birthday

The food was very teasty.  And we even met the  waiter boy from our country. It was so surprised. He wrote ""Happy Birthday"" in ukrainian on cake. 

We really happy that we choose that restoran. I can defenetly recomend",4
"I would review my experience if the restaurant had been OPEN to accommodate my
party of 4 diners.  An email was sent to myself the day before from open table  re booking and I confirmed we would be attending   There was no note on door to say why closed - very poor way to run business!!",0
I had best roast dinner in my life .  Friendly staff. Lovely place,4
"Food was brilliant, service was shocking as soon as we paid and gave tip was rushing us out the door actually asked us to hurry up because they wanted to go home  hadn't even finished our drinks its not supposed to close until 2am this was 11 will not do again miller carter much better service",2
Well can‚Äôt really say much as the restaurant was closed and no one had bothered to call and let us know. We had to look for another restaurant to go and have dinner at. üò°,0
"Have been here a few times. Excellent food and great cocktails.
Great atmosphere and surroundings.
Will definitely be back again soon",4
"The food was not great.. I was not a fan of the food unfortunately.. but the staff and setting of the restaurant was great.. they also did not have lobsters which was very annoying as we actually went there to eat lobster.. 

I dont think I‚Äôll ever come back.",2
Great food and service. Marcelina gave  us unforgettable service and experience,4
"Really nice restaurant, lovely setting. Not massive so it does feel overcrowded. Food was delicious and worth the money. Great place for a treat.",4
"Lovely restaurant. Warm welcome, great service and fantastic steaks.",4
"Great food and very chilled, shame they don‚Äôt have the bottomless brunch available as yet - will be back when they do",2
"The interior is nice however one side of the restaurant leaves you looking at the escalator for lakeside shopping centre. 
Starter was nice. Had lobster with mash potatoes for main, mash was dry and tasteless. 
The dessert menu was brought out and we were told ‚Äúwe are short of desserts today‚Äù from the fairly lengthy menu we were given three choices two of which were not even of the dessert menu. The one we chose was nice in fairness. 
The young waiters/waitresses were polite however the service was slow. 

The bill for two of us with drinks came in at ¬£119. I can see what they are trying to achieve but on the whole I think this place is overpriced and poorly located. 
Disappointed, I wouldn‚Äôt eat here again and wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to friends.",1
Massively overpriced and very below par food!! Will not be eating here again.,0
"Before you see this review, I just want to make two things clear. The manager who dealt with us was brilliant, her customer service skills were excellent and she could not do enough to look after us once we had flagged the issues. The food was delicious, high-end and we would have enjoyed it more if served in a suitable time frame,
Two main gripes were about the waiter who was assigned to look after us and the wait between starter and mains being 35-45 minutes (and not due to being busy).

Our waiter was not engaging, didn‚Äôt warm to us greatly and had no knowledge of the wines. I don‚Äôt want to sound too obnoxious, but there were three ros√®‚Äôs on offer just by name, all I asked was what type of wine they were (blush/Pinot etc.) his first response was ‚Äòwell they‚Äôre rose‚Äô and then when I pressed him more he had to leave the table and go and check. When he returned he only told me the grape of one of the three, the first I mentioned, so I just took that one because I felt we were putting him out if we were to ask for details of the others.

The rest of ordering went well, drinks and food came out for starters and teasers. The ¬£3.50 for bread being two mini rolls from a packet, and not anything more rustique/sourdough or freshly baked was a bit disappointing, but we were there for the steak and lobster so didn‚Äôt want to make that a focus. 

When our starters were collected we were asked if we were ready for the mains, and we confirmed. 35 minutes later we had to chase what was going on, one waitress said ‚Äòjust on its way‚Äô another said ‚Äò4 minutes‚Äô but with no explanation. The restaurant was NOT busy, we had a long reservation so that we could make our next reservation at the 10pm. We were not rushing the staff. The manager came over and apologised, and honestly told us the ticket had been lost. I don‚Äôt know how this happens in restaurants like this?
This just dampened our date night, we had to eat, ask for the bill/ card machine in the same 10 mins.

25% off bill",0
"Terrible. Wouldn‚Äôt come back if someone paid me, and then paid for my meal. The food was cold, and the steak was underdone. Would have sent it back if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that the kitchen staff (all approx 20yrs old) were all staring out into the empty restaurant whilst messing around with each other, what would‚Äôve been the point! 
The waitresses were clueless. Give you 2 menus, one for Sunday lunch, other for steak/lobster etc but the sides at the bottom are all the same bar the price?! How can you charge different amounts for THE SAME THING?!
Explained this and she shrugged. 
They forgot a side, which we had to remind them about and it came out as we basically finished. The side in question was the most watery mac and cheese I‚Äôve ever seen. 
They give you ‚Äòhalf a lobster‚Äô which was basically lobster tail and claw. They wont give you anything to help you get into the lobster though, had to crack that myself üëçüèº 
The price was ridiculous, ¬£150 for 2 main meals, and 2 cocktails! 
The only plus was the fact it was quiet, probably because of how terrible it is!",0
"a disappointing experience for the price we paid.
lots of stuff wasn't available on the menu, food was not hot, borderline cold - felt like it was just sitting there on the side and then given to us -> wagyu burger was horrendous 
we had to wait until our mains for our drinks to arrive which was just a joke.
do not recommend for the price paid at all.",0
"Overcooked lobster, no drinks in the bar, very load music and way to pricey for what they deliver.
I",0
The service is very good.  The food was very tasty and nice. Keep up the good  work,3
"The restaurant itself was decorated very well and had a lovely feel to it, however the music being played was not background music, my partner and I couldn't even have a conversation without shouting and repeating ourselves throughout.

The service was mediocre and we had to ask for our olives and bread twice. We were also served our main as our starter plates were removed, there was no break whatsoever between courses.

The food was average at best. My starter which had been labelled as prawn and cheese bites came out as melted cheese with prawns, that were very hard, floating in it. I had a burger for my main and it was probably the highlight of the evening, it was lovely. My partner had steak and it wasn't cooked how he had asked and was chewy and the dalphinoise potatoes were dry.

I had a lovely cocktail but my partner had a pint of the house beer and it was flat and tasteless.

It wasnt cheap considering we only had one drink each, it was around ¬£85.

We were not impressed at all and won't be going back.",2
"Nice atmosphere created by staff members, delicious food.. will come back soon",4
Service was poor even though it was very quite food was ok over priced,2
"They had nothing to eat, only steak, they run out of lobster and even bumps for burgers. Appealing experience",0
"Our server was relatively slow and kept forgetting things we asked for  i.e. sauces. Luckily there was another girl nearby who was more than happy to help.
Food was lukewarm. Cocktails weren't great - no option for classic cocktails and they didn't allow us to order a mocktail - these simple compromises would have made our experience much better.",1
"Amazing service , food was incredible would defo go again",4
"I went to Bourgee for the first time with my Mum as a Mother's Day treat. 
Whilst the food was nice and tasty, I felt like I could have done a lot of it myself at home quite simply, yet the restaurant was charging a premium for it. 
The interior from a distance looks plush and expensive, but once you're inside It's actually a bit tatty and cheap looking, which for a new restaurant was surprising.

The waiting staff weren't very enthusiastic, seemed a bit like they were just doing the minimal expected, although they polite and did a good job.

I would go back again to try other dishes and perhaps find something I was more impressed with, but so far I have mixed feelings about whether it's actually worth the visit.",2
"Served by a lovely lady, food is amazing. I‚Äôll come back soon!",4
"Manager was rude, cocktails did not have any alcohol in them, food was bland, lobster was running with water straight out of a boiling pot no doubt. Ordered starters then told half an hour later they had run out of it, same happened with one of the mains, had to ask for forgotten items numerous times! 
Would never dine there again and wasted ¬£300, should definitely gone elsewhere!",0
"the beef noodle broth soup had waaay too much ginger and lemon grass, it was inedible.

The chips looked so tired.. it tasted and looked like chips purchased the day before , left in the fridge and reheated in the microwave the next day.. Inedible... 

It was my wedding anniversary, i had mentioned it in my reservation, nothing was mentioned when we arrived, we had to wait several minutes to be seated even though the restaurant was empty.. i wont be returning.... Food also not worth the price...",0
Service really let the place down but it‚Äôs still new so hopefully just teething issues while the staff find their feet. The food and cocktails were impeccable and the decor is lovely. Also most of the waitresses were wearing skirts so short I could basically see everything which was very off putting while trying to enjoy my food.,3
"This is our second time eating here.  The first time it was super quiet so there were no problems.  This time it was Mother's Day.  

Positives.  The food is amazing, the steak was delicious and that sauces were to die for.  Enough food so that you are full but not that it goes to waste.  The staff as well were super friendly and sweet.  

Albeit, of course it is going to be busy and the staff are going to be rushed off their feet so we understand that but still, it was a little embarrassing to take out mother's out for a meal and for there to be a variety of issues.

Firstly, it was the lack of stock.  We got the excuse it is Mother's Day so they have been busy and, working in the food industry I totally understand that but surely management know to stock up extra for named events as it is going to be more busy than a regular day?  Father's Day, Valentines, New Years etc... No beer (cannot remember the name), no dauphinoise potatoes, no pink lemonade, no bread and butter pudding, the barrel for the beer was broken... This seems like a definite management problem and the problem is the staff get the blunt end of the stick so I really felt sorry for them but still...  I was looking forward to dauphinoise potatoes.  

Then it was the many times we had to ask where things were because they hadn't come out, either the kitchen or the staff's fault but there were about three dishes and drinks that we had to ask about because it seems they were forgotten about and we had to ask numerous times as it seems we asked one person and then they forgot... Can't really blame Mother's Day for not bringing us what we had ordered.   However, the staff were attentive and we had them coming to us asking our meal was so it is a little of an emotional paradox for me.

Overall, the food was amazing and the staff were really sweet and kind.  Would I bring someone here for a event like a birthday or Father's Day?  Probably would hunt elsewhere just in case this happened again.",1
"Thought the service was a bit slow, as it wasn‚Äôt fully booked.
Food ok.",2
"Had a lovely Mother‚Äôs Day with my family there! Very nice staff amazing food!
Highly recommend!",4
"Poor service 
Waited for drinks to be told out of stock wasn‚Äôt informed just was just waiting wondering why not arrived 
Was given wrong food 
Food missing 
No cutlery 
Bill wrong 3 times 
Just seem to have constantly have  to chase the staff up on things 
All other tables around us seem to be complaining to",0
Underwhelming and over priced. Average meal on mother's day but glad we tried so know now to go better steakhouse nearby,2
"Would never return back here. Ordered the flat iron steak medium rare, they came out with a blue fillet. Sent it back then they came out with another fillet cooked rare, we waited over an hour for food so we complained and said we didn‚Äôt want to send it back again as we waited so long. They told us we would have freshly cooked sides etc, my peppercorn sauce had skin on it so had been sitting on the side for ages, and the chips were cold so not freshly made. Steak was bland in flavour, service was awful they were slow and didn‚Äôt have a clue what food belonged to what table. We said we was disappointed and they offered us a free dessert but we refused as we just wanted to leave the restaurant. Same happened to another table next to us where they waited over 2 hours for food and they bought their steak out wrong aswell.",0
"I was disappointed that the ¬£30 rib eye steak was so small!
However, I thoroughly enjoyed all the rest of tge meal. Staff were very attentive and a pleasure to be looked after by them all.",3
"Don‚Äôt bother we wouldn‚Äôt come back. 

Seated at our table we ordered and heard a couple of tables around us all complaining but we received our ‚Äúprawn and lobster cheese bites‚Äù we received two prawns floating in a bowl of melted cheese with no lobster which we was very confused about we didn‚Äôt say anything at this point. ‚ÄúFresh bread‚Äù we got a bread roll which was defrosted with a cold sauce to dip it in. Our steak and burger arrived and my partners burger was so dry as if it was sitting around for ages and the bun was very stale. The supposed to be medium steak was very well done I showed it to the waiter and she took it away and then returned it telling me it was medium, we have photos of the steak being brown all the way through which we thought was abit of a joke, but she still told me it was medium we still hadn‚Äôt received drinks we ordered at the same time as ordering food. The waiter asked if we wanted a discount but that isn‚Äôt really the point we came out for a lovely meal not to have money off food that kind of defeats the point. We left our food then a lady bought over the bill which we had not asked for and said that we had asked for it which we hadn‚Äôt , she was very argumentative then asked if we wanted a drink and we just said to leave it at this point as it was getting silly. The table next to us ordered a flat iron medium rare and revived a rump blue and they sent there food back multiple times before giving up too. The waiters didn‚Äôt know what food belonged to what table either which was amusing to watch them pass it from table to table. We then bumped into the customers from bourgee in bar a few doors down which was very funny all saying they was let down but drinks were nice. 

We had a lovely cocktail at the bar waiting for our table the bar staff were very nice.

Overall drinks are nice but wouldn‚Äôt go further than that. 
Go to the miller and Carter!",1
"Rushed to order. Staff seemed lost.

Should have waiter per a couple of tables. Not a nice vibe when you keep getting asked if your ready to order. I was waiting for the chef to come out and ask that‚Äôs how many people asked us.",1
I have visited before and the food was 10/10 but on this occasion i did not enjoy my lobster as it was a bit cold,3
"Good was amazing, service was outstanding and the experience as a whole was really nice, even after we ate we stayed for another glass of wine because the atmosphere was so nice.",4
"Really nice food (although a little bit pricey) and great service.  The music was too loud, but it was turned down a little bit upon request.",4
"Went for my partners birthday, waitress was really welcoming and escorted us to our table. Raspberry Gin Fizz cocktail was nice! Starters came up quickly.. lobster bon bons were presented really nice. The texture was like eating slop however. The waitress accidentally got our mains wrong so corrected them straight away!",3
Went on Friday lovely service from a gentleman. Food was great value,4
"We had  a lovely afternoon on the boardwalk. Wine and food was fantastic , service was incredible ‚ù§Ô∏è",4
Came here for first time to try out. Very impressed with food and setting.  Food was exceptional and great selection of cocktails. Very nice atmosphere and decor. Will definitely come again in the near future.,4
"Food was good, but the music was so loud you couldn't hear yourself think. Service was poor with the waiter not knowing the menu and the wrong food then delivered. This may have been because the waiter couldn't hear because of the loud music.",2
"Definitely be coming back, had the beef ramen & it was delicious. Waitress was lovely too.",4
"We are in your lakeside branch , very impressed! 
Service was amazing and a great  atmosphere. 
The wine was great value and the staff looking after us were faultless 
We will be back",4
Food was delicious and the service was excellent.,4
"Massively overpriced, cold chips the ketchup and mayonnaise had skin on clearly been left out for a while, the condiment bowls were sloppy with huge drips of old sauce down the sides. The waitress changed the chips and was surprised the sauce was like that as she made them fresh in the morning, we ate at 745pm. The Ramen was really bland and unseasoned .  Real shame the restaurant was really nicely fitted out but Hugely overpriced and sloppy. Would not recommend or return.",0
"This is our Third visit to the restaurant and this time we took 4 of our friends but unfortunately it was very disappointing.
Firstly my Cocktail needed to be sent back , waitress and bar staff said that it was most probably missing a syrup as it should have been quite sweet and it was very bitter. A different cocktail was given but by then it was a little embarrassing.
Secondly one of our friends ordered the Katsu chicken curry , now this was a Saturday evening around 8:3ish and once the order was taken the waitress informed us that they had run out of RICE really , how on earth did that happen ? 
Chips were offered and she accepted as in the space of half an hour two things were wrong and now she was getting embarrassed. 
Finally the cinnamon doughnuts which I have had before and was raving about them were very disappointing way way too much cinnamon to even eat.  They came up looking like they had been rolled in chocolate not a delicate taste of cinnamon as Ive had before.  So sorry not the best experience.",1
First time here and the food was to a 5* service. Would definitely recommend and will be returning.,4
"Was sitting for at least 20 minutes and no one came over, ended up having to ask to be served.
When drinks came, my Heineken was served in a whisky glass which made it completely flat. Food was nice, the cocktail was nice but the service let it down massively. 
Staff was at the bar chatting while we sat clearly waiting to be served.
A lady next to us asked for the bill twice before having to go to the bar and get it.
Would rate it 3 out of 5 as the service was poor for the money you spent. Would not recommend.",2
"The baked camembert starter & the king prawn & lobster cheese starters are amazing!! Steak was cooked to perfection.. Southern soul cocktails are amazing.. eaten at lakeside twice and both times the food, service & atmosphere have been incredible",4
"Waiting time is really long
Steak was good!!!",3
It was great food,4
"Tried to do a walk in but told they were fully booked.  Went onto open table app  and booked a reservation and walked back in and was seated - very bizarre!!

Extensive menu and the food was delicious.  

Service not great, everyone was very friendly but we were never really checked on, never offered a dessert menu or additional drinks unless we requested them. It didn‚Äôt seem that busy in there for them to ignore us.

I would go again as the steak was lovely.",3
"Service was excellent really attentive. Food was lovely, only negative it was a bit cold in restaurant",4
"Service was great, restaurant was lovely. 
We head steak and although it tasted nice, the meat itself was very chewy and difficult to cut. 
I would return but perhaps try something else on the menu.",3
"Amazing food, wasn't rushed.
Waitress seemed quiet new and wasn't sure of thr menu and forgot a couple of items.
But overall it was an amazing lunch and will happily go back.",3
"The worst steak I have ever had. I have been to the Chelmsford branch multiple times and had great experience so was extremely disappointed with this visit to Lakeside branch. The steak had no flavour at all and taste like water, so I assume it must have been frozen. 
How can you advertise a Sunday roast and have cheap frozen potatoes. I was unable to eat them 
Very disappointing  
I raised it with the server who had no care tbh that we paid ¬£60 for 2 meals that we didn't eat due to food quality
Avoid!",0
Wonderful food cooked perfectly staff very friendly and helpful,4
The food was excellent and the service was so amazing. My friends and I enjoyed our night out at this restaurant. Will be coming back again soon.,4
Some of the staff were not helpful and the food was burnt not great at all,0
The only good thing about this restaurant was the ambience. The service and the food was pretty poor. My experience was 3/10. Everything was bland and the steak was very dry. Nobody asked if we enjoyed the food otherwise I would‚Äôve said then.,0
"First time visiting at lakeside , friendly staff, lovely atmosphere. We was told 15 mins for starter which was fine 40 mins later our mains came before starter , sent back , they gave us more olives bonus! Another 15 min wait , gyozas were lovely but two slices of very small bread for a bowl of Camembert. Main meal unfortunately was reheated, and they forgot the truffle chips, they were Very apologetic but that was it. Overall disappointing but may give another try another time.",2
"Anniversary dinner, ordered and was still eating starter when they brought main meal to us, had to send back then when we got the main it was over cooked, the staff were lovely and helpful and the new main was brought over and was delicious, just spoilt as my husband had finished his main when I just started mine, was very disappointed 

Would have been better customer service to at least offer some sort of discount or free meal but I can‚Äôt fault the staff or the ambience",3
"Lovely restaurant, really nice decor. The food was outstanding! And the service was amazing! Definitely be visiting again.",4
"Food was great, we had steak which was cooked perfectly and was very succulent and juicy, staff was great anything we asked for was dealt with swiftly and professionally, very polite. Will definatley be returning. Thank you for A great experience.",4
Fillet steak cooked to perfection! Nice atmosphere created by all team members! Highly recommend!!,4
"Overall it was okay. Cannot complain about food as the food was good. It was not too busy on my visit, however, it took 3 members of staff to sit us down after we had been stood at the door for a couple of minutes. And the service was somewhat disappointing. The waitress that was serving us was really trying to give good service however it felt like she was the only one working, despite the fact that there were lots of staff standing around, leaning against the wall next to the food pass, and manager had very poor professionalism (on their phone a lot). As we were leaving, there were 2 managers by the door and 1 waiter made a direct eye contact and all of them ignored us as we were leaving. This restaurant has a lot of potential, but managers could use more training in hospitality.",3
"Beef ramen was tasty but putting rocket in it instead of bok Choi because you have run out of it but don‚Äôt tell the customers isn‚Äôt great. I‚Äôd rather you just take it off the menu for the time being.
Fillet steak was underdone and tasteless with just a few chips and handful of rocket thrown on the plate.
You can go to Miller and Carter for the same money and get a much better tasting meal.",1
"Fantastic food tasted amazing! Size of the sides where small when ordering the sharing tomahawk and no steak knives. Other than that brilliant. 
Service where pleasant but boll no one really stood out, however they where polite.",4
"Waitress took ages to come and pay for bill. 

Staff standing around and having a chat! 

Very expensive for what it was - no sides etc Miller & Carter a lot better value for money",2
"What an amazing new restaurant, exactly what lakeside needed. The food was 10/10 I had a tomahawk steak & a lobster to share between two. Which was great value. The service was impeccable. Definitely recommend the Mr & Mrs bourgee cocktails. Will be back thats for sure!!!!",4
The duck leg and the steak was cooked to perfection,4
"Food was good, service was trash. Not for me, won‚Äôt be coming back",0
Steak was fabulous ! Cooked to perfection ! Waitress was lovely we were sat by a draughty door but moved us with ease ‚Ä¶ prices great value for money . We will be back,4
We Ordered expensive steak medium to well done and it came back as a rock. Manager politely asked if we would like another but we refused as it was a waste of food for it to happen again. Not only that we had no knife and forks. It was not a nice experience. Staff were friendly but food was not good. Over cooked steak and soggy chips.,1
"Very nice ,service wasn‚Äôt that good was waiting for a while, food was nice just the Dophinwar potato‚Äôs was a really small portion other than that it was a really nice place to eat and I will go there again",3
"Food was amazing but the service was shocking, probably the worst I have ever received. 

We were celebrating our first Valentine‚Äôs Day together so thought Bourgee looked like a really nice place to go and was also local to us. 

Our waitress was lovely and took our orders, starters and drinks came up very quick as did the mains. Once we had finished our mains we sat and waited nearly half an hour for someone to come and clear our plates away. Eventually a man came and cleared our table and at this point he was ready to get the bill, not even ask if we wanted desserts. After we had to ask for a dessert menu, it then took another half hour for someone to bring it to us after being ignored by several waiters/waistresses. 

For dessert I ordered the mini cinnamon donuts and my partner ordered the mars bar cheesecake. Once these arrives I took a bit of the cinnamon donut to find there was strawberry jam in them (not stated on the menu and me also being allergic to strawberries). When asking the waitress if there was strawberry jam in them, she couldn‚Äôt give me a definite answer and had to find out from someone else. When it was confirmed it was in fact strawberry jam, I was then asked if I wanted this taken off of the bill (which I thought was a stupid question as I‚Äôm not going to eat something I am allergic to). 

I was then approached by a small blonde manager who advised she had taken this off of the bill, but also pretty much said it was my fault for not telling them. Never mind not being asked if there were any allergies before we sat down, like you would do at any other restaurant. Even if I was to order my partners dessert which was the mars bar cheesecake, this was still served with strawberries (again, not stated on the menu). The manager did not seem friendly and did not seem willing to help the waitress serving us who quiet clearly was struggling as there were several people in our area also complaining. I won‚Äôt be going back or recommending to anyone.",0
"Shannon was brilliant at accommodating us during our evening meal. Friendly service from her, and made us feel comfortable during our evening. 
The food was nice, only downside was the lobster seemed to be missing majority of the meat when served considering it was a ¬£30 dish, other than that everything from service to taste of food was spot on!",3
A steak restaurant with no steak knives is all I need to say meals are well overpriced and to be fair you can get much better else were and for cheaper warm drinks hardly anything on the menu,1
I was quite dissatisfied with our visit. We expected from your website for the experience to be wonderful. It was mediocre. The food was nice. When we arrived we stood at the doors for quite some time as the lights weren‚Äôt turned on and the doors were not open. All the staff just stood behind the bar talking so we were unsure if you were open. When we were sat down we were handed the menu to then find out that your 2 courses for ¬£14.50 wasn‚Äôt on. Even though you had the A board out the front advertising it. We watched 2 different parties leave once sat down because of this. All in all the food was good but I just felt the atmosphere was almost awkward. I wouldn‚Äôt rush back but I would give it another chance if there was a deal on. The mac n cheese couldn‚Äôt have been sooo good but the top was almost burnt and the pasta was stuck to the dish. Maybe we will have better luck next time :),2
Food was lovey however you could tell it was a new place with new staff as service was really slow and multiple things were forgotten in our order.,2
"Most beautiful venue, amazing service and lovely food x",4
"We couldn‚Äôt make our meal Due to our car breaking down. I tried to call to push back our table an hour or 2 and no answer. I called about 6 times. The first time however a woman did answer. I asked if it was possible to move my table back and she hung up? 
Ridiculous. We went elsewhere, had a lovely meal. Very upset you couldn‚Äôt hire the staff to even answer a phone.",0
My girlfriend ordered cinnamon doughnuts (didn‚Äôt say anything about ham inside) my girlfriend is allergic to jam! The guy offered to take her desert off the menu which I thought was a joke seen as he‚Äôs caused my girlfriend to be ill. Terrible attitude from the manager there! Other staff were perfect,0
Great CS and food!,4
"Fab service, food was tasty and lovely. Just gutted the roasts weren‚Äôt available , as we‚Äôd booked for 3.30pm and that‚Äôs what the kids were hoping for.",3
I‚Äôve never tried before such an amazing food. Service there is efficient and very kind. Highly recommend!!!!!,4
"Nice food and service,  bit noisy for us,  although could have been down to a large grouo",3
"We enjoyed our evening and had excellent waitress service. One point that wasn‚Äôt so so good was the main course arriving literally as we had finished the starter.
We would go again.",3
"We were celebrating my wife‚Äôs birthday, service was great. We really enjoyed cocktails, starter and dessert. However main course was a bit of a let down. We both ordered steaks and we thought that they were over cooked, we went for medium to well but we got well done instead, also chips were of a low quality. We got nice birthday treat for my wife which we appreciate very much.",3
"Food was lovely and Staff member Teagan really made our day, service was amazing and she even arranged a birthday surprise for my partners bday which was unexpected and a lovely touch! Would defo come back again",3
"Great atmosphere, the food tasted good as expected. However, the service was very slow and we often felt like we were being ignored. We tried to flag down staff and were walked past more than once. The drinks also took half an hour to arrive.",2
"We used to eat at the Southend branch & were excited when these guys opened in lakeside. Hubby eats Steak I eat Lobster so great for us. Of course there are minor hiccups, staff being trained etc but you can‚Äôt fault how kind & helpful the staff are & apologise when drinks take longer than expected. The atmosphere is great, the decor is beautiful. Our 3rd visit & each time it gets better. You can‚Äôt knock the staff for doing their upmost to keep you happy, such lovely waitresses & manager runs around doing more than her fair share. We will be back next week.",4
Service was shocking. Had to remind waitress for drinks and sides. Steaks undercooked and tough.,0
"Visited here for my partners birthday after trying the Chelmsford restaurant.   The restaurant was beautifully designed but with the most uncomfortable chairs to sit on, they look the sort however not comfortable at all. We chose Sunday lunch which was very nice, and my child had chicken nuggets and chips which he enjoyed. There was no gesture for my partners birthday which we have experienced in other restaurants such as small dessert. The service however was not good. After finishing our meal the tables were not cleared and we had a hard job getting any one‚Äôs attention to clear them as well as  and get us the dessert menu. I would probably not return to this bourgee but would the Chelmsford branch which has better service.",2
Great food and atmosphere service very slow Had to ask to clear the tables,2
Our waitress was Shannon she was amazing she was very attentive would definitely come back if Shannon would be our waitress food was delicious as were the cocktails,4
"Service started off great but declined throughout the evening, despite all this the food was very good and the setting was nice!",3
Cheers Chris for sorting the table ! Will see you soon,4
"King prawn smoked haddock cheese pot pie contained a vast amount of mushrooms not shown on the menu, my daughter hates mushrooms , absolutely no sign or taste  of any fish only mushrooms and cheese very disappointing",1
"Myself and my partner came here for the first time on Friday night. All the staff we spoke to were very friendly and attentive. The food was very nice and we would definitely come back, the only thing I would say is the side orders are quite pricey and they are very small, it was still an enjoyable meal though.",4
Shannon was a great host!! Really put us at ease and relaxed. Gave us some special recommendations that tasted nice and she was right!! Brilliant work shannon,4
"Really good food and quiet atmosphere.
Nice restaurant",4
"Really disappointed. Rude, unwelcoming staff and awful service.",0
"We dined on Saturday . The staff out the front were doing their best to handle a restaurant of angry customers due to poor food and issues with the kitchen . We ordered and luckily had a pleasant meal. Our waiter and different servers who served us done amazing. 
I hope it was just an off day, but I‚Äôll give it 5* for our personal experience",4
Most annoying no coffee apparently the machines broke that twice we‚Äôve been in there and not had coffee after our meal,4
"Food was nice however pricing did not represent the size out the meals, I had a lobster which when arrived had nowhere near as much meat as expected, our started did not arrive when the staff were very apologetic for but we was still a bit disappointed as we expected a high standard of service being a higher priced restaurant. All start were very polite and respectful which I‚Äôve found rare to see in restaurants.",2
"The worst dinner experience I have ever had, between no notice taken of a allergie warning given to all staff several times that was ignored completely, twice. 40min wait for 2 starters, and then a dinner served to two out of the 4 adults 15min before the other two had received there food, and a further 25min before all the corrections were made for wrong food received 

Staff who didn‚Äôt understand there own drinks menu 

And a ‚Äúmanager‚Äù who whispers when he talks, doesn‚Äôt make eye contact and clearly cannot manage very well, completely brushing of the allergy issues as if we hadn‚Äôt made every staff member aware at several points of the meal, without even a single apology even had the cheek to pat me on the back as if I was his pal at the pub 

Awful experience I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone, and if I could have given it 0 starts I would have 

To anyone with an allergy please DO NOT here",0
"Great food, service and ambience. Will definitely go back.",3
Chris cocktail were amazing,4
"Excellent service, food was amazing, cocktails were fabulous! Will definately be back",4
The service was very slow and not up to standard.,1
"We had a meal for 2, everything was Ok. I wouldn‚Äôt say wow it was amazing but it was ok, my steak was very slightly over cooked for the medium rare I ordered and the pepper corn sauce was thick, it didn‚Äôt run out of the jug it was served in, I had to scoop it out. The restaurant was really quiet with only 2 or 3 other tables. I would say the waitress was slow, especially when dealing with the bill.",2
"We had a lovely server . He done all he could for us . The drinks were lovely . Steak was bland and didn‚Äôt taste of anything . He did get us a pot of garlic butter which helped the steak massively. 
We are giving this experience a 5 as he really made it a special occasion and went beyond to help us resolve food issues.",4
Great steaks and well cooked. Good service. Lobster is grossly overpriced for the size. Big Easy sell same lobster for over ¬£20 less!! Desserts are tiny for the price. Unfortunately the restaurant is part of a major shopping centre so is loud and has a lot of kids so not great for the ambience for this type of restaurant.,2
"Terrible experience. 
Offered a table right in front of the drafts door, so close to other table. We pointed out we would rather sit elsewhere and they did find another table, but that too was drafty as next to another door.
I asked for a rare steak, when it came it looked delicious but when I tucked in the inside of my steak was fridge cold!! Waitress came over (she was actually lovely, only her second day) I asked her to feel the inside of the steak and how cold it was and she was very apologetic. Apparently when it was returned the chef said ‚ÄòShe wanted it rare, what does she expect?!‚Äù Erm, rare but at least warm and cooked!! They then made a fresh one but it came out with chips when I had ordered mash.  Waiter then said ‚ÄúWell don‚Äôt you just want to take the chips instead?‚Äù Again, erm no! I would like what I ordered! 
It‚Äôs not a cheap place to eat and the decor is nice, but the food was awful. I was actually sick twice during the night after eating here too!! Save your money and visit STK or Miller & Carter!!",0
"Trrible service, horrible attitudes, cold food, undertrained staff",0
Food was tasteless! Expected more for the price. I‚Äôve had tastier steak in a chain pub!,1
"Was not a very  good experience,
Was my sons birthday so wanted it to be special, waitress‚Äôs we‚Äôre lovely just not very knowledgeable with drinks,
The roast was not how it looks on your Instagram page, wish I had of taken a picture, it was literally a piece of steak and left over vegetables in a giant frozen Yorkshire pudding, mojito was made with ice cubes and not crushed ice, didn‚Äôt taste very nice, for premium prices I want a premium drink,
No horseradish or mustard????
Had to ask for more cutlery as table not relayed after starters, had to ask for more drinks, dessert menu ‚Ä¶
The list goes on..
I loved the Bourgee in Southend,
You just wouldn‚Äôt think it was the same company, very disappointing",1
"Poor food quality - no taste , very bland , chicken was rather chewy and the steak had a lot of fat. Rude staff members throughout. Definitely not worth the long wait times or the price .",0
"Was really looking forward to coming. Started off well with champagne and starters. Main (steak) was very bland. Desert was ok. Service for drinks was very slow and apparently ran out of champagne on a Saturday evening. It‚Äôs a shame, hopefully Chelmsford location may be better",3
"It‚Äôs a lovely restaurant to look at but I don‚Äôt feel the food was worth the money. I mean the starters was nice and the drinks but the mains was a bit meh‚Ä¶ I had the king prawn, lobster pot pie‚Ä¶ there wasn‚Äôt one king prawn, I think I had a few tiny ones but all I know is there was a lot of mushrooms. My husband had the steak and a side of cauliflower cheese, lol there was one little clove. We came out still hungry.  
Which is a shame because the pictures on their instagram look amazing and we was really looking forward to trying this new restaurant.",2
Disappointed. Was shown to a table next to boardwalk window very cold with people walking past. Ask for another table given one by front door. One seat under a cold air conditioner blowing cold air the other with back to front door. I asked twice for the fan to be turned off then swapped seat with my husband only to find each time the door opened blast of cold air.  Apparently even with lots of empty tables moving was a big deal. Food was just ok it‚Äôs a shame because when we visited on Christmas Eve it was all great. Not sure we will return.,1
"Apart from the lovely decor in the restaurant everything else was poor, long wait times for food, then when it came it was dry and tasteless, lots of staff hanging around not knowing what to do with themselves, I asked for extra dip never turned up! 

Wont be returning again. 2*",0
"Decent steak and great service 
Venue looks nice",4
We wanted to try this new Restaurant as we both enjoy steak and the menu looked amazing. We booked via OpenTable and arrived at the designated time there were only two other tables that were there we were greeted with someone who it felt could not be bothered to even talk to us or take us to our table cocktail I had was lovely my husband had a burger which quite frankly was tasteless  I ordered a fillet steak medium rare thinking that would be a safe option but the steak came and it was very dry not particularly nice at all very disappointed it cost us ¬£100 and we will not go back there at all service was bad and lack character very underwhelmed üôÅ,0
"Over an hour wait on food. Half hour on drinks. Burgers were a little dry tasting. Presentation on the bourgee lobster 1kg was a messy pile on a plain white plate with the lobster overhanging and almost falling off, but did taste great.",1
Great steak the venue was amazing . Staff were fantastic,4
Starters were not great and its very expensive for what it is but its a good experience,3
Tables were too close to others with no space in between.,2
Overall disappointed with our experience at Bourgee. The service was slow; we waited an hour for our food and when it arrived some of the items were wrong and cold. The food tasted average and didn‚Äôt have much flavour - so overpriced for what it was! We had at least 4 different waitresses serving our table and unfortunately it seemed like none of them were overly interested in being there. Really disappointed as we were looking forward to visiting! We won‚Äôt be returning any time soon.,1
"Nice looking restaurant but they were short staffed, we had a burger and steak and both were over cooked and dry. Also a long wait for drinks due to lack of staff. Wouldn‚Äôt rush back",1
Great food (although chilly chips but it was very busy & few staff) - no hot drinks though so we didn‚Äôt stick around for dessert.,3
Great food and good service.  Very lively with a good atmosphere.,3
"We heard a lot of good things about this restaurant , our friends recently visited their chelmsford Branch for their Xmas work night out. 
The decor is stunning and the food was delicious. 

The small bartender and the young man serving us were fantastic and made us feel very welcome. 

We don‚Äôt normally write reviews but I‚Äôd like to say they really made our experience amazing and when they asked if I could leave a review I said yes as they went out of their way to make me and my partner well special it‚Äôs only fair their hard work is acknowledged. 

We will return and tell all of our friends and families. 

Thank you 
Bev",4
"Great food and experience. On par with city dining, will be regulars going forward for sure. Just need mocktails to be added for the wife.",4
"Food cold , service poor and hostile wouldn‚Äôt go again for the price",0
"A real enjoyable lunch . The gentleman serving us was fantastic and the set menu is very affordable. 
Will return next time o come shopping",4
Staff were efficient and attentive,3
"Shocking!!!!!
Will definitely not be going back.
Food took ages and once it arrived it tasted awful. My childrens steaks were over cooked, my husbands wagu burger was disgusting and my prawn ramen noodles tasted like dish water‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ The bill came to ¬£140 , the food tasted like it was worth 14p not ¬£140.",0
"We turned up for our meal, there was no table available 
Then got moved twice, lots of dirty tables.
Then got asked to sit at the bar where we were ignored, so we left.
Definitely would not recommend and we will not be going back!
Really sad for us as we loved the southend restaurant.",0
Extremely slow service and the steak was over cooked/ burnt when served to us. Disappointing.,0
"The food was very nice but little pricey really for what it was. 
I thought it would be a bit busier so wasn‚Äôt really an atmosphere in there so not the restaurant‚Äôs fault. 
Staff weren‚Äôt overly attentive. 
I‚Äôd return if it was a special occasion but a bit pricey for just a dinner.",3
"Really good food, but there was a mix-up with the order so some arrived later than expected. We were very kindly offered a discount on the bill.",3
"The food was good, not amazing but good. The starters were the hardest choice as we wanted everything and when the food came out everything was satisfactory; except my friend ordered a medium done steak and it came out blue, when then replaced it they then gave it to her without the sauce. When this was bought to the waitress‚Äô attention she responded with ‚Äúoh well, sorry about that‚Äù. We asked for condiments and received none. Lastly, the service was incredibly slow. It was bookings only, and the restaurant had about three tables occupied but it took 10 minutes for us to be seated, half an hour to take our drinks and additional half an hour to take a food order. It then took an hour to attempt to flag someone down to pay the bill (bare in mind we asked for it when they cleaned away the table). In the end my other friend went up to the bar to pay it and paid for the whole tab so we didn‚Äôt need to wait further. Thank god there wasn‚Äôt a service charge, otherwise we would have requested to take it off. They also took the steak meal off because it wasn‚Äôt right twice. I would come back for the food, but I won‚Äôt rush back for the service.",2
Booked it as a birthday treat for my Husband but was very disappointed. Even the we booked a table we had to wait almost 20 mins to be seated at the many empty tables that were there. For the money the food was very average. Considering it had not long been opened the decor was already scruffy. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend and wouldn‚Äôt go again,1
It wasn‚Äôt even open! It‚Äôs a second time Open table do this to me! We book the table go there and it‚Äôs closed!,0
We booked last minute. Had a great table. Service was very good wasn‚Äôt kept waiting between course‚Äôs. Food was great. Will definitely be going back.,4
"Food was very nice . Restaurant only been open a week and had a few issues.
No coffee machine, bread we ordered when arrived did not come .
Poor greeting on arrival",2
"Distinctly average, ¬£180 for a family of four, only 3 alcoholic drinks and 2 starters, laminate cheap wobbly table that you would find in a cafe, was really looking forward to it, service was super slow, only got asked when we sat down once for drinks, wrong meal given, really wanted to live it, but sorry will not be returning, very overpriced for what it is",1
Service and waitresses just needs training otherwise would have been a perfect evening.,2
Service was amazing! Amy the waitress was amazing and so helpful!,4
"It was an amazing experience.food is great.
The steak flavour is delicious.
Starters are delicious 
Definitely i will return",4
Amazing a real class restaurant  and fantastic food,4
"The food was divine and the service exceptional, would definitely recommend Bourgee its become our new favourite restaurant.",4
Great food but there was a wait that wasn‚Äôt really explained. When we got the food it was amazing so for that I would happily go back,2
"We come here on the 11th for dinner and the whole evening was just awful.  We waited 45 minutes for our drinks to arrive (still got it wrong and no water ever showed up) another 40 minutes for our starters, my husband‚Äôs didn‚Äôt even turn up! A further half hour for our mains. At that point we see 2 families get up and leave as they were  also having a terrible time with the service and there was 2 further tables complaining. The food was ok, our steaks were lovely. They charge a fortune for half a lobster and it was really watery. We had the smallest pot of sauce and again they got my sauce wrong. It wasn‚Äôt even overly busy, It was just complete shambles!",0
Didn‚Äôt even get to eat in there waited an hour for our starters for them to then come over to ask what we ordered as she didn‚Äôt put through the system was our first proper date night with out our children paid for a sitter and was completely let down.,0
"Went here on the 10th Dec. Had only been open a few days. The food was nice but the service was awful. It took 45 minutes for our starters to come. Then another 45 minutes after that to get our mains i.e. we'd been there 1hr 30 mins before we got any mains. We struggled to order drinks and items we asked for didn't come. We saw other tables get their mains before their starters etc.

We watched multiple tables come and leave after drinks etc. or waiting just as long as us for food. It was quite manic, and the restaurant wasn't even full. Tables were left uncleaned when people left etc. They didn't clear our starters and we just cleared them ourselves onto a neighbouring table. There were other issues throughout really, all service related. They were just completely overrun basically.

Apart from that, the food was actually quite nice. The steaks were good - mine perfectly cooked - my sides were nice too. Camembert starter was nice, although could have done with more bread for it (1 slice of French stick is not enough with a whole Camembert). We did ask for more but that never arrived and we didn't bother to ask again.

Unfortunately the terrible service didn't make up for the nice food. For the price you're paying here, we expected better.

At the end of the meal we did tell them of our disappointment and they said they were 5 staff down, which I'd imagine will have been the main issue if true. To be fair to them, they then offered to comp a round of drinks at the end when we told them but we declined as it was late.

If they couldn't fulfil the tables, they shouldn't have taken quite so many in, and should have just seated the tables that they had the staff to serve well. They were still taking walk-ins and we had only booked at 5pm that evening.

Hopefully it's just teething issues with them being newly open. The food itself was nice so we will maybe try again in a few months once they are more settled in and hopefully the organisation and service has improved.",1
"Frequent and regular Bourgee customers in chelmsford. After Chris mentioned the new venue opening we had to go and check it out ourselves. 
The venue is stunning and the service was great . Thank you Chris for organising a lovely meal and we can‚Äôt wait to return. 
Have a lovely Christmas Bourgee üéÑ",4
Why accept reservations if the restaurant is no longer there? Frustrating.,0
Restaurant is closed. Still let me make a reservation on open table.,0
The restaurant was closed and it was our valentines dinner. Very unprofessional on both Open table and Chophouse to keep the options available.,0
No comment,0
This place is no longer is business and ruined our Valentine‚Äôs Day!!!,0
This location is out of business and this app allowed me to make a reservation anyway. Imagine my surprise when I showed up for a Valentine‚Äôs Day dinner with my wife and the place was out of business. They lost my business at all locations for good as well as I will not use the open table app any longer.,0
This place is closed.,0
The restaurant was closed and appeared to be out of business even though reservations are still processing and the phone is still working.,0
The restaurant is not open.   I show up on Valentines Day with my wife and the place is closed.   Two other couples were there as well.  I can‚Äôt believe open table allowed me to make a reservation and confirmed the reservation the day of and the place was closed.   Luckily I have been married 40 years so my wife and I could laugh at the situation.   The other two guys were in trouble.  Makes it hard to trust the app for important occasions.   However I have used the app at least 40 times without an issue.   But for big stuff not so sure anymore.,0
Horrible and very disappointed!! Drove 45 minutes to a closed down gutted restaurant that does not exist !  How can they have reservations still available on open table and phone lines taking reservations as if business as usual is happening there?  So much for a special Valentine dinner experience ‚Ä¶.,0
Out of business!!!!,0
Server and food were great. Ambiance for the first half was enjoyable. Second half of dinner was absolutely ruined by a large party that shouted across the table to talk to each other. Actually had to leave and sit outside to wrap up dinner and conversation.,3
Not a good experience over all. The food is bad and over priced for nothing,0
"It was warm inside the restaurant. Food was good, not great. I expected a little bit more based on the price. Service started off slow, which was surprising since only three other customers were present when we arrived.",1
We went for ‚ÄúLunner‚Äù late lunch/early dinner. There were only a few others there dinning. The place looked very clean and tidy. The waiter was attentive and the food was good. We each got a cocktail and enjoyed them very much. We liked that it was tucked away and not in a high traffic area. We will be back often as it is chino but not all the way to chino hills. Great close location to Eastvale.,4
"We had a reservation for lunch at 2:30 in the afternoon.  The food was excellent and the employees were extremely friendly.  However, they were understaffed.  I believe there were only 2 employees and we had a large group.  I would definitely go back because the empoyees are very nice and all of the items ordered were very tasty and well presented/plated!",3
Food is very average and prices high,2
It was the worst service I have ever experienced. We order a appetizer and got it 20min after receiving our meals what took almost two hours to receive. Not only that but I order a plate over a hundred dollars that came with two sides and never received the second side. We asked a few times about the second side and they just kept saying it should be out soon. No waiter or waitress ever checked on us.,0
Steaks were great. Everything else was just decent. Ordered a burger medium rare and it came out well done. Our server fixed it right away. Took a while for our server to acknowledge us.,2
"Went to celebrate Father‚Äôs Day as well as my mothers birthday. The reviews looked good so I thought it‚Äôd be promising. 

My actual experience:

-Right off the bat, there was no one really there so that was odd
-They weren‚Äôt prepared for our reservation when we arrived on time
-Their menu was limited and you could only order from their Father‚Äôs Day menu, which didn‚Äôt have anything my dad 
wanted, but he made do
-Food took over 50 minutes to get to us (there were only 4 of us) 
-My mom‚Äôs ‚Äúchicken & waffles‚Äù were two mini waffles with 2 small pieces of chicken strips that looked like they were from a fast food place
-My brother asked for no onions, his platter was smothered in it
-I asked for fruit instead of fries, they served me a literal cup of plastic fruit you buy for your kids lunch (picture included) until I complained and then they brought me out actual fruit ?? Weird that I had to complain for that to happen
-Each plate was $23-27 for the worst food and experience ever. 

Granted I used to work in a restaurant and studied hospitality management so I know how and when to address things in an appropriate manner. When I finally decided to complain to the manager because my entire family seemed miserable with the experience, he offered to ‚Äúhelp us‚Äù by getting us some more chicken, some fries and a free beer for my dad. Cool. Well, until we got the bill and turns out he added everything to the bill‚Ä¶ Quite a slap in the face, but he also offered to give us 15% off the tab.. well he did 15% off each item instead of the full tab so that the discount wouldn‚Äôt be as prominent. We payed the tab full price because at this point my dad had just had it.

Worst Father‚Äôs Day lunch ever, at least we were able to laugh about it after but I would like to save anyone else the trouble of coming here.",0
I was expecting a lot more for a $25 hamburger and fries. I would clarify this place as an overpriced bar. The manager had an attitude.,2
"I wasn't extremely pleased with the experience because the food was limited. we did a grad party there and they failed to mention that the menu was only 4-6 items. the service was great, and the manager was helpful but I just wish I would have known when placing the reservation so we could have made and informed decision. the food was BAR food, not great.. not bad..",3
Service was great food was not. Food cold and bland. For the price we paid this was a terrible experience.,2
"the place was way understaffed, the food was cold and overall a bad experience. 
Would not go back there",1
Food nothing special.  Not worth the prices charged.  Service was ok.  Won‚Äôt go back.,0
"Service was absolutely great! Wish I‚Äôd got our servers name but she was a amazing!  She has some tatts on her arms if that helps and black hair. She was attentive, patient and got our order correct and out in a timely matter. We were celebrating my Dad‚Äôs Bday and she made us feel right at home. 

Now the only bad review I must note and I understand everything has gone up on price‚Ä¶. But I couldn‚Äôt believe they charge $9 for THREE Asparagus. Their steak selections are A La Carte so they charge you $9 for sides‚Ä¶ which is ridiculous to be honest.
Overall the food tasted delicious, which makes up for their prices.",4
The food was over priced and extremely salted.,0
"I know understaffed 
Last 2 times there the waiter is the bartender 
Other people not helping each other , poor guy had 8 drinks to make 2 trips from bar , I even stood up to help him because co corkers are busy folding napkins . The co worker should at least try to help him , maybe take our order instead of us sitting for 30 minutes just sitting and waiting . Not sure if we will be back but o love to support the local business, all workers should work together , it‚Äôs called SERVICE",3
Poor service. Over 30 mins to place our dinner order and over an hour to get our food. Other tables were turning faster than ours. We had a party of 4. The poor service outweighs the food. Won‚Äôt go back.,0
"Small food selection for brunch but waitress allowed us to order appetizers and salmon sandwich from main menu.  Room smells stale, ambiance did not make up for the overpriced food. Tiny Ch363 burger - need magnifying glass. Substituted fries for salad but got extra charged. Calamari batter was too thick/slightly burnt. Parmesan fries in a bowl for $14 the size of medium McDonald's fries. Not going back.",1
Our reservation was acknowledged but we were never seated. Spoke to 3 other parties that had reservations and were never seated. All parties left as did we.,0
"we waiting until 45 mins AFTER our reservation time before we gave up and left.  While they explained technical issues were involved, we were still very disappointed and unhappy.",0
"My reservation was at 5:30. I had my parents and my brothers family come to celebrate Mother‚Äôs Day! They drove 2 hours away. I arrived there at 5:15 and I was told that they 1 hour and a half behind. Disappointed but I understand because of the holiday. I was told that they would call me when it‚Äôs 15 minutes before time to sit. 

Never received a call or text. My parents informed me that they are ready to seat us. We ordered appetizers and ALL the food came back UNDER cooked!! We had to send back THREE plates. One hour passed, no food! Two hours passed, NO food! THREE hours passed and NO FOOD!! ü§¨

I spoke with the manager about our experience and I asked him what our options are. Also I want to point out THE MANAGER NEVER CAME TO US WITH ANY UPDATES!! Not ONE TIME!! 

Our reservations was at 5:30 and NOW it is 9:00PM. NO FOOD! 

We stood up to leave. We tried to be patient but when they served TWO tables who came in AFTER  we did, we decided to leave! 

And when we got up after waiting since 5:30, they gave us a bill that totaled $300!! ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ The only reason why I was upset is because the manage NEVER communicated with us AND wanted us to pay for our appetizers AFTER WAITING FOR FOUR HOURS!! 

Terrible experience and I will NEVER EVER go back. Ruined our entire day. We ended up at Yardhouse at 10PM just to eat. They served us in less than 20 minutes!",0
"Took my family here for Mother‚Äôs Day. They gave us a seat outside which we thought would be nice, BUT once we sat down, the flies swarmed in. We asked the waitress if they had anything to get rid of the flies and she said that she would wipe down the table with a rag that had something in it that the flies didn‚Äôt like. That didn‚Äôt help. I asked if We could sit inside but said it was going to be a 2hr wait. I ended up going to Stater Brothers next door and bought 2 candles that were supposedly going to help keep the flies away. It helped just for a bit. An hour later, I bought 4 more candles (6 total now).  3 hours later, we finally got our main meals which was mediocre. Unfortunately, our experience here was not the greatest. 

Pros: waitress was very responsive and nice 
Cons: outdoor seating, the 3 hour wait, food",0
How is this place still in business!! Made reservations at this restaurant at 2 pm the host told us that we were still going to have to wait about 15-20 mins that turned into 45 minutes I mean why make reservations if you still have to wait correct after they finally sat us down they took our order for drinks at around 3:20 they took our order  and it‚Äôs currently 5:10 and we still have yet to receive anything,0
Food not good. Not even the fries,1
"The service was horrible, it took approximately 90 minutes from the time we ordered to the time we received our food BUT grant you they were extremely busy because it was mother's day.  
Once we were served, the food was excellent! I will definitely go back again.",2
Wayyyy overpriced. Service below average,4
"Although the owner/server was really cool and was able to accommodate our party of 30, overall the experience was pretty bad. We waited over an hour to be seated with our reservation then waited almost 3 hours to get our food and the quality was ok. I had a Cesar chicken salad which was decent and my boyfriend had the pesto chicken sandwich was really good. My other family members order a salmon burger but they brought out salmon plates and then brought it back to the kitchen and swapped out the salmon onto the burger. The owner comped a lot of times on our check and made sure that we didn‚Äôt pay for anything that we didn‚Äôt like. The kitchen just seemed swamped and would‚Äôve like to see the owner in the back of the kitchen helping the chef. Definitely not coming here again‚òπÔ∏è",0
"First off they had a set brunch menu with little variation, ran out of many ingredients including fried eggs and fries around 1:30pm because there were only 6 items to choose from. Waited about an hour to receive our food, ordered a $25 burger only for it to be the size of a McDonalds cheeseburger which was served with scrambled eggs in the burger (which I've never heard of). Additionally there was a fly infestation going on in the patio which then moved inside because they decided to keep the doors wide open. Overall very disappointed with this experience, the quality of food we received was not worth the price, everything was disorganized, and not a good sign when the majority of guests do not have food on the table. Will not go back again.",0
Mother's Day reservation for 7 and they wanted us to crowd around two small tables outside. The flies were terrible. Drink service was slow. Servers looked stressed. They had a reduced menu but ran out of fresh eggs by our 12:30 reservation and put powdered scrambled eggs on our burgers. The burger meat was the size a a large sausage patty as if they were skimping. One order of fries was seasoned and the rest were not. It was very disappointing. Not a way to treat mothers or anyone else for that matter.,1
Mother‚Äôs Day it‚Äôs busy,4
"The rice was under-cooked & still hard with both entrees. Flies inside and outside, loud environment, subpar service.",1
Food tasted amazing,4
"The drinks and calamari were fabulous! The atmosphere was very minimal which isn‚Äôt an issue but I did feel like the prices just weren‚Äôt worth the atmosphere provided or the food received. Paying over $40 for just a piece of steak felt excessive. The lobster pasta had a ton of flavor, but if there hadn‚Äôt been lobster included it would have tasted the exact same. 
I‚Äôd come back for drinks and appetizers but I‚Äôve had better food for better prices elsewhere.",3
"Great find, will highly recommend the place and definitely going back",4
"Wonderful first time at the Chop House ! A hidden gem. My husband and I went for Sunday dinner; Wagu steak, Mac n Cheese omg outstanding. The wait staff perfection ! Love this place we will be back soon 
The Fords from Riverside",4
I actually stopped by to pick up dinner. They did not disappoint. I would‚Äôve preferred to have dinner there but I needed to bring it home for my significant other.,4
Great food and great service,4
Enjoyed everything with the signature ¬≥‚Å∂¬≥ on the menu,4
Last minute decision and glad we did.  Service was excellent.,4
Michael was nice and did his job. The food from the kitchen and the drinks from the bar came out very slowly. One person got a chopped wedge appetizer salad two minutes before the entr√©es came. We asked multiple times for ketchup for the fries. Most entr√©es came out barely warm to outright cold. It was not worth asking to send back because we were all hungry. The restaurant was no more than half full so the kitchen and bar should not have been this taxed. Great in concept but not in experience. Consider us one and done.,2
"Hands down a hidden gem üíé! This place is clean, simplistic, and has value and passion behind their food and drinks! The BEST Old Fashioned I‚Äôve had in quite sometime! Their burgers and sandwiches are so flavorful and the Wagyu blended burgers are delicious. Highly recommend 10/10 service was quick and accommodating as well!",4
"First time here and had a very good meal. I had the ribeye that was cooked medium rare and was very tasty. The sides were very good too, we had the Mac and Cheese, mashed potatoes and asparagus. If you are in the mood for a good quality meal and pay for that quality, you need to try this out!",4
Food excellent. Very good job in handling my wife's food allergies (although they did forget to add steak to her steak salad). Shrimp scampi was outstanding. So noisy that we could barely hear our server over the din (although it was St Patty's day). We will return but maybe pick a different time of day.,3
"Great place, food, drinks and awesome service! Cleanliness is on point!",4
Very loud and atmosphere was not matching the prices or food,2
"Lighting was very inviting from outside, looks classy.  Inside, the wall was plain, it needs sound dampening and more arts?  The tables and chairs are cafeteria style. The wall plus the cement floor - amplified everyone's conversation and laughter 10 fold.  We could not enjoy our dinner because there was a big group behind us that was sooo loud; to the point of ""ear deafening"" when they laugh and holler.

Steaks presentation needs a little help though.  Our filet mignons and Wagou's came out on big nice plates, but the steak knives are ""on the plate"" - right next to the steaks.  Ewww.

Service was OK.  Our waitress has a good attitude, but she was not all attentive.  I almost finished my steak before she brought out my wine.  Wine was poured into a weirdly small cocktail glass.

Other than the bad atmosphere/ambiance -- the cocktails were good.  Dynamite shrimp was very good.  Brussel sprouts were great!  Mushrooms were on-par.  The steaks were DELICIOUS! Quality and taste comparable to Morton's and Ruth Chris'. 

I left with a conflicted feeling:  such great food, but it didn't go with the atmosphere.  Outside seating turned out to be better.  Sunset, gentle breeze, beautiful lighting and quiet.  I will definitely come back, but we'll dine outside the cafeteria.",2
Horrible experience. I will never return to this place!,0
"I was there yesterday with my daughter and decided to give this place a second chance and it was the worst. Our hostess sat us down but no one knowledge to take our order until 25 minutes later I asked the bartender to take our order. The restaurant wasn‚Äôt busy at all, but yet the waitress never took the time to help us out. This is really bad customer service and I hope you address this to your staff.",0
"Good steak,  good drinks",4
"It was nice, needs some female interior decoration. Like some life.. plants would be nice. But overall it was great food and great service!",3
"Still had to wait 25 minutes with our reservations, food was ok services was not good lots of waiting",2
"We made a reservation at 7:00 pm we got there on time , they did not respect our reservation and leave us waiting for 45 minutes .

The service was AWFUL! The gentleman who served us was rude and disrespectful.

We order Buffalo wings and the chicken was not cooked properly besides we have to wait almost another 40 minutes for my sons order.",1
Servers were very pleasant and reactive.  Ambient noise was loud enough that table conversation was difficult.  Food was good.  The steak was good and prepared correctly.  Lobster was good and reasonable.,3
"Had a reservation 3 weeks in advance. Showed up on time. And could not get the table I had reserved without waiting for 30 minutes ( also relied to text day of to ensure they held our table ). I Was offered a patio table and decided that would work. Waited about 15 minutes for a server, and an additional 10-15 minutes to get our drinks. A couple who were seated after us got their drinks and food before us. My ribeye was overcooked, and for the price, was not what I was expecting.  Ordered a second round of drinks. And after 15 minutes, they only brought my beer, and not my wife's mixed drink. We finished our dinner and they had still not brought my wife's drink. We asked them to cancel her drink, paid and left. The company that occupied that location before chophouse( The Mear Cellar ) was a much better quality in my opinion.",0
Great place to hop in for great drinks and some dinner. The service was really good. The wait time was amazingly fast to be seated which was really the cherry on top with most restaurants having over 1hr wait times now a days. The Double Chop Mule was super good‚Ä¶.cheers!,4
We went there for a first date on Valentine‚Äôs Day and it was the perfect place. It was decorated so cute. We shared the tomahawk steak and it was delicious. The chocolate cake was delicious and we even got engraved beer glasses. The food was perfect. This is the second time I‚Äôve been here and it was even better than the first time. I can‚Äôt wait to come back again. This time for breakfast maybe üôÉ,4
Limited menu for Valentine‚Äôs Day,2
We love coming here to grab some drinks and food for a lil night out. We went on a saturday and since it is valentines/superbowl weekend it was a little backed up but overall our server i believe her name was madelyn was such a great sport so it made up for the wait! overall it is a good place to dine and have some drinks !,4
We made a reservation for 7:45pm. And they never sat us. They kept saying 15 more minutes. After waiting 45 minutes we went to Kings Fish House in Corona. I was truly upset. I‚Äôve heard wonderful things about this restaurant and really wanted to give them a try.,0
Making a reservation and still waiting 30mins mins to be seating  was a bit much. But the service by Noel G made up for it. Excellent server and bartender.,4
Yummy üòã food! Very relaxing.,3
Great as always!,4
First time at the Chop House and it was great. The service was impeccable and the food was some of the best we have ever had. Would recommend to anyone looking for a a vibrant atmosphere and great service.,4
We waited over an hour to receive our food. We felt bad for the servers because we didn‚Äôt see any management walking around to try and help the situation. The server was on her own. Wasn‚Äôt offered anything for the inconvenience and having a toddler with us who needs to eat and can‚Äôt wait an hour for food. The food is pricey for the type of restaurant but the food is good. We had to pay a huge upgrade for a baked potato which is on the menu for sides. Didn‚Äôt make sense.,1
Katie the server was so great. She‚Äôs friendly and energetic and made sure our order was brought out correctly.,4
Good food and nice options,3
"Good is not worth the price. Good wasn‚Äôt cooked correctly, how can you mess up a steak when you claim you are a steakhouse?  They told us we‚Äôd get happy hour drinks and then when the bill came, charged us for the foul cost.  Bill was over 730 for 9 of us.   

Only thing we had that was really good was their tuna appetizer.",1
Waited half hour while bartender se,1
"Everything was Awesome. Great food, drinks and service",4
Terrible.. food was NOT fresh. Salad was yellow and had to be thrown away. Drinks were inconsistently made. Very disappointed.,0
"Went for Happy Hour to watch football. Great service, very attentive and the food was excellent. Happy hour beer selection was outstanding",4
"This restaurant is gorgeous,  the staff has an amazing way of making you feel special while you‚Äôre there. 
This is easily becoming it go to for special nights and after work hang out. 

We just discovered this gem a couple of months ago and we love it. The foods is amazing!!!",4
Ok so I found this place by yelping steakhouse near or around Anaheim area‚Ä¶. Based on pics and reviews thought it would be somewhere nice to celebrate my hubby‚Äôs bday! Totally overdressed‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like a Buffalo Wild Wings scene that sells a $42 filet mignon‚Ä¶ I mean the food was great but I wouldn‚Äôt drive out 1 hr to eat here again since we are from LA‚Ä¶ We actually did get an  awesome waiter and drinks were great can‚Äôt lie but if u live in the area‚Ä¶ I guess I was expecting more of a steakhouse type of a restaurant than a pajama party! Like ppl really were in loungewear! They are def a chop above the rest in Chino‚Ä¶. I kinda ruined my hubby‚Äôs bday dinner by picking this spot! Lol my bad. Even their IG is a bit deceiving looks kinda nice to go for a bday dinner with the family but it‚Äôs more like a SNF kinda spot!,2
"I can‚Äôt say enough about the quality of the food. Purely divine. I had the short ribs!!! Boneless , what !!!?? With yummy mashed potatoes underneath and bacon wrapped asparagus. My guy had the avocado burger which was cooked to perfection with a hint of pink in the center. The fries - crispy and extremely flavorful. I almost forgot to mention the brussels sprouts‚Ä¶ Oh‚Ä¶ M‚Ä¶ G!!! Honey!!!! Bomb!!",4
Very good food. Delicious steak salad. Just very pricey,3
Great food!  Everything from appetizers to desert! Great bar with delicious drinks too!,4
"The food was great, nice and juicy.",4
"First of all , no hostess to greet you and check on reservation. No one to acknowledge you. Second noise level is like a sports bar. Waiter was good but seemed overwhelmed, took about 10-15 to greet us . Food was good but luke  warm, appetizer came out after our entrees and cold . Waiter was trying hard to redeem the long wait times by comping drinks , never going back ! Ambience is that of a brewery not a steak house, no style just a bunch of tables set out in a big empty room . No teamwork no one knew who the waiter was, this place needs a lot of help in that dept. It is presented very nice in the web site but it‚Äôs all smoke and mirrors. Bartender had about 2 couples at the bar, he could of helped the waiter but he would not come out from behind the bar. I saw a lot of upset people because they waited a long time for their food. New Year‚Äôs Eve is a very busy time of the year for restaurants should of been fully staffed .",1
Food and service were terrible. It took almost an hour to get our meal and the food tasted terrible and was returned.  The staff was nice but very very slow.,0
Heater was not working and was very cold inside. Food took forever to come out and when it finally did it did not come out together. The burgers were cold and they ran out of fries. They did comp us desert and did not charge for 3 of the entrees and discounted the others but overall it was a disappointing 20th B-Day for my daughter!,0
Great food and waiter,4
Food and drinks were excellent. Be prepared to spend some money. It was Christmas Eve dinner so we splurged. Bill was about $110 per person (tip included).,3
"Great service, the food was delicious. Definitely recommend the Tomahawk Steak",4
We had a great time. Our server was very attentive!!!,3
"Not a good experience.  Poor atmosphere.  More of a sports bar than a chophouse.  Caprese salad had a nice presentation.  Unfortunately, the tomatoes were like cardboard and not tasty at all.  When the entree came, the steak was decent but the baked potato was so cold that the butter placed on top didn't melt.  Overpriced.",0
Very curious to try this place so glad I did food was very good atmosphere was good seems like a great great place to watch sporting events as well,4
"We were a party of 11. We had an amazing server. She was on it, attentive & very helpful. 
I usually love their ahi tuna appetizer, but last night was not good. We ordered 3 of them. They now put a big glob of guacamole on it, with very little ahi. And the ahi must be frozen, because some of the few pieces were still hard and icy. Some pieces had no ahi on them. Way too much guacamole. It‚Äôs supposed to be an ahi appetizer, not chips & guacamole. 
All our food was not served hot. Some was warm, but most were not even warm. I had the salmon with mango chutney and rice pilaf. The salmon didn‚Äôt taste seasoned at all. It was cooked to the right temperature, but no seasoning. Tge chutney was underripe mango with no flavor and not much of it. The rice was dry, and tasteless. 
The wedge was too much lettuce (half a head), and not enough of everything else. 
Though the burgers & fries  weren‚Äôt hot, the three who ordered them said they were good. 
The short rib was too much gravy. The tomahawk steak was tender and delicious, but it takes a very long time to cook. My son eats it medium rare, and he had to send it back twice and it was still pretty rare. So if you‚Äôre getting it, order it as soon as you set down. 
Since the ahi is what I was really craving, we probably won‚Äôt be back.",1
FOOD WAS GREAT BUT IT WAS TOO LOUD IN THE RESTAURANT.,3
Waited over an hour and 30 minutes asked for medium steak received rare was taken back to throw in oven!,0
Food was delicious and serves great. Noice level was high but we would go back.,4
"Food: Steak and sides were delicious. Poki appetizer was okay, fish wasn‚Äôt fresh and very little of it.
Drinks: Beer was flat.
Service: Took more than 10 minutes to get beer with no other customers in restaurant. Food was delivered quickly but waiter waited till food was almost done to ask if anything was needed.
Atmosphere: sat outside, music was a little loud and some of the songs were a little vulgar (every swear word and private part mentioned) with kids around.",2
"We went here for the first time and loved it! The food and service was great and the cocktails were so good! The only thing I didn‚Äôt love was the atmosphere. Is it a sports bar or a gastropub? And I also didn‚Äôt love that there aren‚Äôt any booths. Regardless of the vibe, the food and service was amazing so we will for sure be back!",3
"I had ordered my filet medium well and when it came out it was not cooked and the plate was covered in blood. The mashed potatoes were too.  I had to send it back to be recooked.  It took over one hour to get food and the restaurant wasn‚Äôt busy.  Very disappointed. 
We typically go there and service is great, but not this time. üôÅ",3
Overall very happy with my dining experience. Service was excellent as was the food. I would definitely go back.,3
We always have a great experience dining here! Great food and great drinks.,4
"Very average food at best. Absolutely overpriced. Burgers/2 entree salads and 3 beers/3 sodas $140. I don‚Äôt mind paying a decent price but not for just average food., I honestly would have had a better meal at an Applebee‚Äôs.",1
"The worst dining experience I've ever had, had a reservation at 7 and weren't seated until 7:30. By 8:30 we asked about our order and never got a response, 8:45 we paid for our drinks and left, no apologies no reason for never getting our dinner! NEVER AGAIN..",0
"I enjoyed our time here!  Nice ambiance, no wait.  The food was pretty good, however, most things required salt.  

Good service. 

Would return .",3
Didn‚Äôt even order. Immediately sat down and then we‚Äôre asked to leave as the place was shutting down.,0
Food was good but overall üëå,3
"Horrible!   Poor service, terrible ambiance, overpriced, need to close.",0
Drinks were good and food was good only unfortunately there were 3 different items thats we wanted but they ran out of.,3
Not what I was expecting.  Its more like a sports bar than a steakhouse.  I wasn't impressed.,1
The service here was horrible. Our server was both unpleasant and unprofessional. Drinks were done incorrectly and service took to long. We had already been sitting for over 30 minutes and our waiter didn‚Äôt even offer to place our order. We ended up leaving shortly after that. With no apologies from the waiter of course.,0
First time there. Won't be going back.,2
It was a good place but need a better appetite there to give us a better taste.,3
For some reason they were a couple things on the menu that they could not provide.  It seemed to  be hit or miss on whether they could provide the entree.,2
We enjoyed our time at the Chophouse. The food was excellent as was the service. Thanks for a great evening.,4
"Changed our reservation.  They didn‚Äôt have the steaks we wanted to try.  Service wasn‚Äôt the best. Ambience was not what we expected for the price.  They need to work on service and  having steaks available for a steak house.  Disappointed.  Won‚Äôt be back.  The food was lukewarm, not hot.  We really wanted to like this place and support small businesses but it just wasn‚Äôt  very good.",1
Awesome service and great food!,4
Food and service were good.,3
"This was the worse experience I have had in a long time at a restaurant. I had high expectations for the chophouse. Service was bad, food didn‚Äôt taste good. And for the experience we had there the bill it was not worth it.",0
"Very bad service, we were not acknowledged for more than 30 minutes. No food or beverages were offered. Place was almost empty and there were plenty of employees that could‚Äôve helped us.",0
"Service sucked. Our waitress (Amy) on the other hand was great. The drinks were delicious as well but watched people walk by our drinks at the bar for 15 min. We got the wings and Brussel sprouts, Brussel sprouts came out brunt. Wings are wings. Waited 30-40 min for our entrees. We both got the Denver waygu steak which was delicious. But the sides were very bland. I don't think it was worth the $200 bill we had.",2
Was not worth the money service took too long and my food was cold when I finally got it. Other orders at my table were all done incorrectly,0
Horrible service. It took over an hour to get our entr√©es. The wait staff was less than candid about why our meal was so late. We paid and had to leave without eating because we did not expect it would take so long to get our food. Other families that came in after were served faster.  THIS IS THE LOCATION IN CHINO CA. NOBODY WORE MASKS. NOT THE STAFF NOT YHE MANAGER AND NOT ANY OF THE CUSTOMERS,0
"Great food, drinks and service was great!",4
I enjoyed the Wagyu 8oz dish.,3
"Had the best Filet Mignon.
Brussel Sprouts are a must have!",4
Very cool spot! Drinks were great. Chophouse burger was delicious. Nice decor and bar area & local!! Will definitely be back soon for a steak,4
Great steaks and fantastic appetizers. Service is great with a lot of interaction with our server. Fun place. Nice drinks.,3
"Everything was amazing! From our server, to the food, and adult beverages! Also, loved the selection of bourbon available!",3
Food was great! Old fashion was great! Service was ok. Only real complaint I had was the flies that were inside the restaurant.,3
delicious food great service it wasn't too busy when we went so noise level was low,4
"We arrived and saw a huge bar. Tried to order a couple beers off the beer menu and we were told that there was only corona in a bottle and coors light on tap. We went with those due to them being the only options and we were told they were the only ones that were cold as well. the server brought our beers and they were not cold they were room temp even a little warm. The glass was soaking wet like they just hosed it off and poured my beer into it.  The bottled corona was not even cold to the touch. The restaurant was full of flys that only got worse once your food arrived. They flew around our heads, food, and were annoying basically from the moment we arrived. The food was probably the only thing I enjoyed but the potatoes were alittle cold and dry. I was really looking forward to coming here but was extremely disappointed by my experience especially when I came to celebrate a birthday which I put on my reservation but they never acknowledged. I would love to return for the filet but I‚Äôm not sure.",0
70th birthday party,4
"Great service.  Fantastic food. 
Awesome location",4
They didn't want to give us paper menu's instead Q codes which my elderly in laws don't have.   After we finally got paper menus we could not look at a wine menu because of Q codes and then it didn't include prices,1
Used to really like this place.  It slowly going down hill sometimes there good and sometimes there not.  It is like it someone different cooking every time.  The chefs aren't all on the same page with how to cook.  It should always taste the same or very similar.,1
"Overall the experience was lackluster at best. The service was less than stellar and had to repeatedly ask for things that should be normal when eating at a restaurant like‚Ä¶ silverware, a napkin maybe. 
Staff was unclear about any of the beverages available and trying to order either wine or beer results in disappointment and many back and fourths to the bar by the server. Probably should have just gotten up and spoke to the bar tender myself but even then‚Ä¶ not sure there would have been much more info. 
The food took forever to come out after ordering and when it did‚Ä¶ everything went back. The steak was thin, dry and overcooked to say the least. The burger was ordered medium rare but showed up VERY dry, overcooked and flavorless. 
Obvious though it may be‚Ä¶I would not recommend this place and will not be making and return visit.",1
"I ordered the salmon meal and my food was brought to me with a fourth of my salmon missing. Then, my zuchinni was extra charred on the bottom.  Our kids got their food first and about 30 minutes later our food came out. Overall, since this was Father's Day, it wasn't a pleasant experience",1
"Megan was a great server! It was Fathers Day so we expected it to be a little slow service-wise. Steak was cooked great but needed more seasoning, overall the food was good and we would go back.",3
"Dining at chophouse 363 to celebrate my husband‚Äôs 1st Father‚Äôs Day was really great, from the hostess, waiter all the way to the food..I ordered salmon and that fish was gooooodd! My husband ordered their Father‚Äôs Day special and he said the steak was cooked to perfection. Cheesecake was also good..our waiter was excellent..we didn‚Äôt have to ask for refill because he was always checking up on us. We would definitely be back!",4
"We were seated on time and drinks were delivered to us was a slow process.  I ordered lemonade and that took at least 15 minutes to get.  The chicken wing appetizers took almost an hour to get and there were only six wings.  They look like something from the freezer section at the grocery store.  The Brussel sprouts finally came out and they were burnt.  We complained to the staff and of course they did not know what to do.  The manager came over and asked what was going on.   All he did was complain about being short staff and that it was father's day.  I wonder in what planet this man would believe we did not know it was father's day.  Basically this restaurant is not ready for guests as they are not sure how to operate.  We left the restaurant after that encounter.  The manager was helping the other table way before we asked for him.  He never once came over to us and asked how things were going.  

He did not even offer a complimentary appetizer.  He kept telling us one of waitresses was crying.  How should the incompetent operations be our fault?  We just wanted to eat with our father for father's day like everyone else.  We left the restaurant.  No since of sitting there and watching everyone else getting fed.  The table next to us received food but we did not.   The manager knew that as he was helping them and completely ignored us.  Maybe it was racial, not sure as we left this establishment as they were not prepared to be a restaurant.  By the way the manager does not know that fact that I worked in restaurants and I was with a person who owned and opened a restaurant so I know the challenges.  Those challenges should not be the fault of the customer.",0
"Went for Father‚Äôs Day dinner.  Hostess, who was outside, walked in ahead of us instead of holding door open for us.  Once seated at the table, took 15 minutes for someone to approach us, which was awkward since several waiters/waitresses walked back-and-forth past our table.  It took nearly 40 minutes to get our entrees.  Not sure what was going on in the kitchen.  As the evening progressed, the service got much better.  Even though it took forever, the food was delicious.  The waiter apologized for the long wait and comped the dessert.",3
"Met my family there with my mom after visiting my dads gravesite.

While I enjoyed the food the flies were completely out of control both outside and inside.  

The place was loud, which I‚Äôm used to, by my poor mother with her hearing aid.

Service was slow which led to three plates of cold mashed potato‚Äôs.  

My family will not be returning.",2
Had to wait 20 mins after reservation time,3
"It‚Äôs nice, server and hostess are friendly. Food came out quickly accurately, and tasty. Went for Fathers Day lunch. Would certainly visit again. A good value for what you get as well",4
Food was okay but not a lot of options. Took awhile for our food and it wasn‚Äôt that busy. Overall people were nice,2
They took almost an hour to serve our food. It wasn't too busy to take that long.,2
Great experience,3
"More of a sports bar scene, not a dinner house. Food was excellent. A little expensive for type of restaurant.  Meat and fish dishes were very good. Veggies were good but small portions. Wedge salad was very good.  Out of baked potatoes and hamburgers.  Overall quality of steaks and seafood was good.",3
Love this place. This is the only restaurant we have dined in with our kids since the pandemic and we love it. We have already been here four times and besides sometimes being out of the things I‚Äôm craving we have no complaints. We have changed what we order every time and everything is SO good! Of course we will be back. Worth the 45 minute for us.,3
"I went here with my daughters. It was like a loud, empty room with cheap tables, but no biggie. I ordered the rib eye steak because it was my birthday and for $54 I believed I wanted to treat myself. Imagine my disappointment when 30 minutes later I was served with a grisly, sinewy, tough steak that I could barely cut with my steak knife. It was also bland and tasted as if there wasn't even salt & pepper on it. The baked potato was small. My daughters got the Steakhouse burger and it was beautiful! Me, not so lucky. Service was poor as well. Drinks weren't refilled and asking for extra sour cream took 20 minutes. I don't think I'll be back.",1
"Fantastic cuts of meat, simple sides. The crust on the Wagu is spectacular. The food is great but it feels like a casual restaurant versus a steakhouse, if you are looking for something with a more formal ambiance.",3
Bacon Avocado üëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèº,4
We love this place! The food is always great and the service has become excellent!!!,4
"Server was friendly. Food was not up to par with steakhouses in this price range, baked potato was hard and not cooked fully.",1
"We went here for my husbands birthday and ordered the Tomahawk Tuesday special, it included a 32oz tomahawk steak, 2 salads, 2 sides and a desert to share and it was amazing. The steak was cooked perfectly as was the asparagus the fries were some of the best I‚Äôve ever had and the chocolate cake topped of a perfect meal. The service was amazing from the hostess Lexi to our waiter Peter and our very attentive busboy. This was a meal we will not soon forget and we will definitely be back. Thanks for a great evening and perfect birthday meal for my husband!",4
Very amazing bday dinner. Would recommend. New hidden gem. We will be back,4
"The waiter who happened to the manager that night had a tough job but he did a great job trying to manage expectations.  However. the staffing and wait times were absolutely horrible! We had approximately 30-45 min wait between drinks, appetizers and final food. Meaning what normally an hour-90 min experience ended up being 3 hours! Again the manager was great and gave us a huge discount! They just need a lot more staffing for a place that busy. Food was good though .",0
"Food took 2hrs after they forgot about out ouder. The food was cold and the burger was not how I ordered it. The server came to the table when we ordered drinks and then to order food we had to flag another waitress down to ask for our order. There were ony 5 other tables being serverd with adequate staffing. They also have a B rating. Good luck here, I hope they can work on their staff culture.",0
"Loved the ambiance and service , outdoor patio has a very relaxed atmosphere and vibe.",4
Overall a great value and ideal with family and friends.,4
I had my birthday celebration at chophouse. Maria our server was impeccable. She went above and beyond! The food was amazing.,4
"I came here to celebrate my birthday with some friends. Our waiter was friendly but the service was a little off. We all placed our orders at the same time & our food came out around the same time except for one of my friends, they completely forgot her order so by the time we were all done eating her plate was barely coming out. Not only did they forget her plate but they forgot several of our sides as well which they made up for by taking it off the tab. The food was bland, not to great but not bad either. There was a table of about 20 ppl behind us celebrating a birthday as well but they were super drunk & SUPER obnoxious which is the main reason why we wanted to get out of there. Overall it was a good place but not good enough to make me want to come back.",1
They held our reservation so it was perfect from the start. Drinks came punctuality and soon came appetizers. Our meat was cooked perfectly and our server was the owner I believe. He made our experience perfect. We will definitely be back for tomahawk Tuesday üíØ,3
Lexi the hostess with the mistress went above an beyond,4
"- bad service
- stale food
- bad experience",0
"We can here because the review was good. Went there on a Sunday for lunch. After we sat down, ordered drinks and looked at the menu, the waitress told us they only serve buffet brunch on Sunday. During a pandemic! Are you kidding me! The buffet setup was messy and so tightly lined up. The food were using disposable aluminum serving tray. Everyone was cramped and using the same serving utensils. It was so disgusting! The inside of the restaurant seems like there was no air circulation. Thank goodness we asked to sit outside. Will never return again.",0
Food wasn‚Äôt too great and lacked flavor however the service was excellent,2
Great little local spot for a quick date night. Or even for a family. We‚Äôll definitely be back with our kiddos.,3
"Just bad all around. The waitress was rude and a sandwich and a burger took over 30 minutes to be ready. At 34 minutes, we asked for the food to go. We only saw our waitress twice; to order drinks and lunch. She never checked on us or mentioned the wait. There was about 12 patrons all together and most had food when we arrived. Can‚Äôt say they were backed up. Will say that we won‚Äôt be back",0
Talking about they were mad because they were closing in 30 min,4
Basic menu for brunch.  They‚Äôre really known for the tomahawk and that‚Äôs about it.  Cool bar though and tv‚Äôs to watch sports games make it a plus too.,3
Good food great service,4
"Brunch buffet selection was very limited for a ‚Äúbuffet ‚Äú they didn‚Äôt even have a dessert station. Compare to other places their buffet was very limited and basic. Other than that, the service was great. We had the bottomless mimosas and my glass was always filled. The servers were on top of it.",3
As always great service. A friend decided to join our party. I called and host was very accommodating. No issues. As always. Staff very attentive. Great drinks! DOG FRIENDLY!,4
Way too loud and too expensive for the atmosphere,0
Waited 45 min even with reservations.  Finally got a table then was told that the kitchen is backed up and could only order drinks.  Waited for the kitchen to get caught up after an HOUR and HALF. They still could not catch up.  Finally told our server that we needed food and ordered after 2 hours from the time we had our table.  Almost 3.5 hours just for food and waiting for our table.  Server was dismissive and short.  We spent almost 200$ on food and drinks. Likely not coming back.,1
"Waitress Amber was awesome. Very friendly and helpful. Split the rib-eye, fries ,and Brussel Sprouts. Plenty for both of us. Margaritas were excellent as well!!üëçüèº",4
I am more than happy to pay for good food and expected this to be just that.  We went for my sisters birthday and she received her food approximately 20 minutes after everyone. In fact it all came out at different times.  I can understand a few minutes difference but 20 minutes when the first person is done was unacceptable.  We live close to this restaurant and had very high hopes for it.  They were out of two of the three desserts that were on the menu. Two ribeyes that were ordered identical were not cooked the same at all.,2
We loved the service and the food!,4
"I understand that Covid has changed the dining experience exponentially and small businesses like this have been hit extra hard. Limited menus are now commonplace and that's expected. But brunch here -ON EASTER- was absolutely not ok. I feel like there is no excuse for what they served. We had only the option of the ""buffet"" which was hardly that. There were 5 chafing dishes. FIVE of food for a restaurant full of people indoor and out. They offered hashbrowns, eggs, sausage, bacon, steak?!, inedible pancakes, equally offensive waffles, and fruit that consisted of melon and a sprinkle of berries. That's it. For $40.

I was lured in with the brunch menu they have online which had items like avocado toast, chilaquiles and biscuits assuming that caliber of food would be served. Understanding that those options are not available at the moment, I expected what they DID serve to be cooked expertly at best- what we were served was not even close. 

Pros-our server Kiki was attentive and kind. As was the hostess. Champagne is bottomless as an add on. The cocktails we ordered were OUTSTANDING. I would come back just for those. My husband enjoyed his steak. Clean bathroom.

Cons- literally everything else. Not enough space to distance at the ""buffet"" station (I use the term buffet very loosely). Not enough types of food. Brunch should have fresh salad, some sort of yogurt or dessert, and bread options that are NOT soggy. To name a few. 

Skip brunch here. Dinner looks legit. 

Dear Chophouse- if you can't do it right- please don't bother. We were ripped off today and didn't complain because your staff was so nice and put their best foot forward even though your restaurant/chefs did not.",2
"Over all experience was good! Drinks were tasty! We ended up getting our food comped. My girlfriend and I were talking and lost track of time. Our waitress was great! She walked up to us and said dinner was on the house because it took over an hour for our food. Once the food arrived, it was delicious. We would go back!",3
"Very good ambiance and amazing food! I‚Äôve been to Chophouse 363 a handful of times and it‚Äôs always a great experience, so I was a bit disappointed when this last time it took well over an HOUR to get our two burgers. I‚Äôll still go back, just hope it isn‚Äôt going to be a consistent timeframe for food.",3
"This place never fails to Amaze me, the Service and food quality is Flemings like, love this place, see you every Thursday",4
Amazing as always!,4
The NY steak was not hot. Seemed to have been sitting on a counter or was reheated. The mashed potatoes we‚Äôre lukewarm as well. No a good experience for my first time.,1
Amazing service and food as always..,4
"Service was great!  Food was so so.  We got 4 $222 A5 Wagyu Steak‚Äôs and the cuts were so so but the quality of the steak was great.  The side dishes, etc leave a lot to be desired.",2
AMAZING ! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,4
Very friendly server. Delicious food and drinks. Not the biggest menu but everything we ordered we devoured. Only complaint I had was the drinks came out late and we had to wait awhile for condiments which made my food a little cold.,3
What a wonderful restaurant and service! 5*,4
"For an appetizer we ordered the caprese salad and it was delicious. The red onions add a nice flavor. 
For our main entree, I ordered the filet mignon and it was very dry and tough. The edges of my cut were very over cooked. I ordered it Medium Rare and there was no pink until I got to the center of the steak. I chose asparagus as my side, which was grilled, and it was also very dry. I was surprised that the dish wasn‚Äôt better given the price point. I did mention my concerns to the waitress and she said I could order a mushroom sauce, but that it would take time to prepare. We were sitting on the patio and it was cold, so by the time it would arrive, my meal would be too cold to enjoy. 
Overall, I liked the ambiance of the restaurant, if I return, I will not be spending over $200 on dinner. I would probably try a salad instead.",3
We had a great time. Delicious food and drinks and amazing service.,4
"Brunch was cold, no selection for the buffet, watermelon was old. Love this place, but won‚Äôt be back for brunch. Was not worth the $40 per person.",3
They ran out of foods waiter was confused when we would make oders,3
"Service was horrible, The manager told us it was because they only allowed three cooks on the line due to Covid. I‚Äôm not sure I really believe this because you‚Äôre not supposed to have indoor dining and they have that. So they were choosing which rules to follow and which ones to ignore?",1
Great food and service!  Our waiter was awesome!!!,4
For 2 burgers and fries plus a small steak for over $110 is definitely a rip off. Be aware of the limited menu plus the pricy burgers and steak.,0
Service was awful. I should‚Äôve listen to all the other reviews. I will not be coming back here.,0
"Service was friendly and outgoing. Food took awhile and server said it would. The steak salad not worth the price. It was iceberg lettuce, onion and tomatoes with 5 slices of steak.  I feel the wait for food needs to be faster. I think for location they are a bit pricey.,",3
"Ambiance was nice. Food was ok. Drinks were good. Ordered a steak medium, it came out rare. Sent it back and it seems like they just threw it in the over and it came back still rare.",3
"Food was delicious, nice atmosphere, reservation was easy and we didn‚Äôt have to wait to get sat at all",4
I‚Äôm not sure what happened this past Sunday but we arrived at the restaurant and we‚Äôre told they only had one item on the menu that day. I thought that was crazy considering they already had a limited brunch menu on Sunday. We decided to dine anyway. This was such a limited menu you couldn‚Äôt even choose the way you wanted your eggs cooked! With such a limited menu you would think the food would come quickly but that wasn‚Äôt the case it took over an hour to get the food! I‚Äôm sorry to leave this review I have dined at this restaurant in the past and the food has been delicious . Sunday was definitely an off day so I‚Äôm hopeful the restaurant goes back to a normal menu and gets the kitchen in check,0
Went in for brunch but could only order one breakfast plate in which order was all wrong.  We didn‚Äôt understand why the brunch menu was gone and we had to order the breakfast plate.  Food was cold too,2
"Great food, great drinks and awesome service by Tommy.",4
Awesome food and vibe,4
"Staff kept talking in huddle for a long time while customers are waiting to place an order. Steak was overcooked. If paying $120 for steak for 2, I expect it to be at least better than what I can make myself at home. Splurging good money on good food is not an issue, but for that price, I can go to a beautiful steakhouse with an ocean view with much better quality food and service.",1
"Let me start by explaining that I've held almost every restaurant job there is.  Busboy, Host, Waiter, Bartender, and Shift Manager.  I am never rude, nor unreasonable.  I cut staff slack when I see they might be challenged.  

Having never been there before, we went based on a recommendation by OpenTable.  We were there to celebrate a Birthday.  It started off fine.  Patio Heaters were on, 1 -man band was playing, and we were seated pretty much on time.  The server came to the table in a reasonable window of time and took our appetizer and drink order.  Then that was the end of the good experience.

Drinks took a while to arrive.  After about 30min I asked where the appetizers were and about 10min later received 1 of the 2 appetizers we had ordered.  Mind you, that was just some Mac & Cheese for the kids.  After another 30min, we asked if they could bring some crackers, chips, fries, anything and were told they had nothing they could bring us to tied us over.  When we later asked for the manager, it was another 10-min before he arrived and while talking to the manager, the 2nd appetizer arrived.   As we sat waiting, we watched other tables, who were seated after us get their food.  All the waitress could tell us, beyond apologizing, was to explain they were having issues with low staff... but they were still seating new tables.  

At about 1hr and 45min after being seated, we had enough and asked for the check.  Funny enough the check came promptly.  Never once was there any offer to ""make it right"".  Instead, we were handed a $60 bill for 2 drinks and 2 appetizers.  From there we went to a Carl's Jr Drive-Thru.  Happy Birthday!  We will never go back there again.",0
Took over 2 hours to get food,2
Kind of disappointed because food was not hot üòï French toast cold and the coffee tasted like I was drinking water,2
Bomb food great ambience,4
"We were excited to try Chophouse 363. Unfortunately for the price the overall experience was not worth it. We were seated outside which is normal with covid but they were out of propane so we were very cold. They must have forgotten to refill for Saturday night rush. Our food took almost an hour. They brought out our daughters food a full 30 minutes ahead of ours even though we requested to be served all at the same time. They brought out the wrong steak. I order filet and received a New York. I still ate it because I didn‚Äôt want to wait any longer. It was cold and I was hungry after waiting so long. Our server was so busy we were finished eating by the time he came to check on our table. Seems like they need more managerial oversight in general. The inside of the restaurant was packed with larger parties, so they must have been under staffed, but for $30+ a plate we expected better.",1
"Nice place, kind of off the beaten path.  Food was delicious though the menu is not extensive.  Seating is a challenge under the pandemic, as it is for most places right now.  We went for dinner and unfortunately sat in the cold for about an hour until they finally got their heaters going.  Overall, staff was friendly and accommodating.",3
"We love it here! Service is always great and food is delicious. Reservations are a must for a Friday and Saturday night though, as they are busy.",4
Reserved seating inside and was sat outside. Food was cold when it arrived at the table. Never received one item. Waitress never check to refill drinks. Not worth it.,0
Wonderful time re-connecting over great food and even better staff!!,4
Good good. Very loud.,3
Hostess is terrible but food and server great!,4
"The worst restaurant with the worst services. Wouldn‚Äôt spend my time, and money on this place.",0
Fantastic drink. Perfectly cooked steaks. Friendly and excellent service. Table was ready on time.,4
"Heard about this place from a friend. Also heard that the food was pretty good, but the service was not. We thought we‚Äôd try it ourselves. The New York steak was terrific. However, the sides with our entrees were cold. They replaced them with hot sides. The cocktails were terrific and we liked the patio and the main room near the bar. The other room was lit like a cafeteria and not very inviting. The servers were very friendly, but very busy. We don‚Äôt mind a long drawn out dinner when we are on a date, but it took over 2 hours to complete our meal because it took so long to get our order placed and our food delivered. If you‚Äôre in a hurry, not the best place to go.",2
This place has awesome food all around! Service is great.,4
Enjoyed the first-time-experience...I will be returning soon!,4
ChopHouse never disappoints. Danny is always so welcoming and wonderful at providing top notch service.,4
Food was very good.  Service extremely slow and wasn‚Äôt that busy.  Took 45 minutes for an appetizer.  Waitress was attentive but just took way too long.,2
We were very disappointed to hear that this restaurant did not stick to the holiday menu they promised. It was a terrible experience. The food and drinks were overpriced and falsely advertised. We were not greeted promptly and food was not cooked properly. Very disappointed.,0
"We Come Here Often And love it, food was small portions this time and overcooked meat, but overall enjoyable Euguene Was our server he was prompt and sweet.",4
"Our server was great!! I wanted to try more from the original menu, I felt the valentine's meal was a bit over priced for the portion served (sides). I am definitely returning to try the original menu!!",4
Food was great. Service was a bit slow to get wine and drinks out but it was Valentines day so we tried to be understanding. Music wasn't very appropriate for the occasion but wasn't blaring. My steak was cooked perfect and the lobster tail was great. Will definitely give the place another shot.,3
Very bad first impression. We got seated late after having reservations. After we had a limited menu to order from.  I was not happy especially telling us that  we only had 5 mins to order. So we got up and left. I felt rushed and that‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt the way I wanted to spend my valentines lunch.,0
"Where to start....the food was decent. 

First off. After waiting 10 or 15 minutes for our server to grace us with her presence, we were told they only serve brunch until two. NO WHERE was that made apparent. I wouldn't have chosen this place for a Valentine's Day LUNCH. They could easily serve steak and/or burgers as both of those are on the Lunch menu (steak and eggs, breakfast burger etc.). No chips and salsa or guac or appetizer for that matter.  
  
The cocktails were lackluster and largely w/o booze, but their regular pours were fine.  

2 out of 3 entree's were served with no mention of the third. We had to keep pestering them to bring out the dish, then missing food, then condiments. WTF?!?!

Our waitress was never around, and when she was, she was chatting up her friend who was seated in her section.

Another table wanted one of the patio heaters as it was a bit chilly.  One would expect the guy to grab one from an unoccupied section right? Nope. He took it from our table...w/o asking. When I gave him a ""WTF face and hand gesture"", he moved one BACK to our table - that was closer to other table.

The bathrooms!!! Messy, without paper towels. Trash on the floor.
Protip: Before ordering look at the bathrooms to decide on weather to stay.

All in all, they need a new FOH manager to keep their servers on task. Whoever (if anyone) is running the place. They need to be fired.",1
"Covid procedures not really being followed - many servers had masks below their nose and no gloves. We couldn‚Äôt tell who was in charge- seemed like all high schoolers. Also had cramped indoor seating with no masks in sight (luckily we were outside). We waited 30 mins for food/appetizers and I could see the cooks in the kitchen not wearing masks. Food was pretty bland. Actually kind of bummed we paid $90 and went to the grocery store after for snacks bc we weren‚Äôt super happy with the meal. Our server (Taylor?) was very sweet and aware. She was the best part of the visit. Hostesses did not have masks on properly, and we heard a lot of people complaining about the wait for their table or food. It was a really busy night so understandably people were getting impatient, but we really didn‚Äôt feel like the restaurant was protecting its guests.",1
Indoor dinning with no covid safety measures taken other than servers wearing masks. Table of 20 people sat very close to our table. No spaces between tables. It would be very simple to keep customers safe. Our food was not hot.,2
"Everything was great and the service was phenomenal but the fried onions were over cooked and our seating right next to the door was a little uncomfortable.   The food was recooked so that was much appreciated.  Besides that, we would recommend your restaurant to anyone.",4
the service was slow. waited forever for drinks and food,2
"Foods is always Great, Johnny took care of us and as always service the Best!",4
Amazing food! The service and cocktails are also top notch.,4
They have really stepped up to the challenges presented by Covid. Safety first followed by great food and even better people!,4
"Even though multiple servers would come check on us, it literally took 1 ¬Ω hour to even get our food. Even after all that time, We had to ask multiple times fr our sides and  ended up cancelling it. Looking around at other tables everyone else looked equally frustrated.The $64 and $56 steaks were good but not sure if this was just a bad night, but gonna think twice before returning. Super bummed with this dining experience",1
"Worst dining experience ever.  Made reservation for 8 pm and got seated at 8:45.  Ordered right away and got our salad at 9:30 and food around 10.  Our waitress checked in on us 1 time and asked how is everything as she walked away and couldn‚Äôt even hear our response. Will never got back.  Food was okay, my steak was good, but my husbands burger was rare and he ordered it medium well.",0
"We had a reservation.  We were seated 45 minutes after we arrived at a table that had been open the entire 45 minutes.

Having the opportunity to watch their operation for 45 minutes indicated they don't have a clue what they're doing.",0
Food was delicious. Service and kitchens time management was terrible.,0
Johnny and his staff do a great job!!,4
Enjoyed a very good dinner. The avocado bacon sandwich was excellent!  The service was very good as well,4
"Terrific service and excellent pub food. Incredibly attentive wait staff. Loved the former Navy tatted waiter we had, he was on point!",4
"Food takes long to come out.  Very disorganized. 
Waiter needs lessons in being respectful",2
"We went here with my fianc√© and his family for his birthday. The food was delicious. I ordered the ribeye and he ordered the wagyu. Both were perfectly cooked and the sides: mashed potatoes and mushrooms were a perfect compliment to the steaks. I had the peach vallini and blueberry lemon martini, both refreshing. My fianc√© had the indigo 363 and it was quite tasty. The mozzarella and tomato appetizer with baguettes was wonderful and light. We will definitely come back here for another celebration dinner. Our server, Amber, was exceptional and attentive. The live music was greasy.",4
"This was a complete and utter disappointment. Front desk was very dismissive and disrespectful. Spoke negatively of our table under the impression that we couldn‚Äôt hear them, but her heard Lou and clear and let a supervisor of sorts know. He was also not very kind or attentive. When notified, he initially tried to make multiple excuses for poor service, instead of acknowledging the issue and attempting to do something about it. Never attempting this place again.",0
The restaurant was busy.  The beer was flat.  Our waiter was just ok.  He was busy so we did not see much of him.  His assistance that was helping him was awesome.  He checked on his many times and did make our experience there much better.,2
Great food very good staff.  we will visit again.,4
The worst service possible. Don't go hungry or expecting good service. Took them 30-45 for every round of drinks requested. Ridiculous!,0
Had to wait about 15 minutes with a reservation not a big deal.  Service was very slow and room was very bright for a Friday night dinner date.,2
We had a great dinner out with the family. Good food and service! Can‚Äôt wait to go back!,4
I have been to Chophouse more than a few times now. Everything is delicious & service is always exceptional. You get a taste of steak house food with a more Yard House experience. A great middle ground!,4
Great experience the staff is friendly and helpful. Great service,4
Delicious food and awesome food,4
"Food takes long to come out.  Very disorganized. 
Waiter needs lessons in being respectful",2
"Had a great time,food was bomb and the drinks were delish! Alex was awesome and the best chef EVER shelly",4
"Food took about 45 to get. Our server was not attentive, we had to ask for everything. No utensils or drinks were brought out until we asked. I paid 14.99 for bottomless mimosas and they informed me they were out of champagne and it will take another 15-20 min to get more. They extended the bottomless mimosas for 30 minutes more and I was only able to ask for 4, I was disappointed. my family and I were disappointed.",1
"Food great, ambience fun but service wasn‚Äôt very good. Our server seemed to cater to the large parties instead of my family of 4. We didn‚Äôt get utensils, refills, or anything  until bartender/manager helped us. We went after 9 pm, maybe next time we will come earlier and hope servers aren‚Äôt ready to go home and they care a little more.",2
It was a perfect for a first date. Food and drinks were amazing!,4
Amazing food. Awesome service. Great atmosphere. Super clean. Had an awesome time. So glad to be able to sit at a restaurant and have a great time and support small businesses.,4
Johnny was awesome food was great,4
"Management is the problem here. 
Bad management. The servers asst and servers are doing a great job. 
Food taste great but it‚Äôs super slow in coming out. Don‚Äôt expect to eat together. Everyone‚Äôs meals came out at different times.",1
OUTSTANDING!! From the atmosphere to the service (Johnny went above and beyond) to the food!! Oh my gosh!! The food was sooooo good!! I had the filet with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus! All of it was so flavorful! I highly recommend!! My husband had the truffle burger and raved about it!! We will most definitely be returning customers!!,4
"The steaks were done to our specific order, service was great, ambience, not so great.  Killed the mood.  Will not return or recommend.  I rather go to Fleming‚Äôs for the same price point.",1
Was a pretty small place specially going to go outside but definitely excellent service good food very affordable check it out you were definitely enjoy it,4
Great food excellent service! Great for kids too,4
Great staff and food was amazing,4
Create experience and service,4
Our server was friendly and attentive. The table was dirty and sticky so was the ground. It‚Äôs very loud inside. It‚Äôs definitely a sports bar. Casual and laid back. Food was ok. Desert was amazing.,2
Our first visit to Chophouse. We will not go back anytime soon. We were sat outside in a dark corner after passing a vacant table next to a heater. We had to ask to change tables. There was two dogs in the patio area barking at each other the whole time. Waitress told us that food was slow coming out. We think it was actually a upsell attempt to purchase alcohol and appetizers. At that point we ordered food with our beverage order. Food came fast so we knew there was a shady deception. Bacon Alvacado burger were delicious. New york steak was $30 for a tiny steak and tiny potato. Waste of money. We wish you all the best in this economy and hope business remains lucrative for you.,3
Friendly and attentive service and the food and drinks were excellent.,4
My family and I had an amazing time! Not only were we obsessed with our server Alex. But the food was delicious and reasonably priced! We can‚Äôt wait to come back and dine again! Thanks again Alex! Much love <3 The Rogers,4
Great food,4
Great food and excellent service. We‚Äôll be back!!,4
