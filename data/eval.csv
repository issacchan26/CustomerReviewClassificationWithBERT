"perfect dinner  great service  beautiful quite  elegant upstairs   waitress was just awesome
food was perfect t and delicious",4
"Although the steak was delicious, it was cooked to “Medium well” instead of what I asked for which is “Medium”.",3
"The food was excellent, and the surface was excellent ￼",4
"Our server Aurora was a good one. She worked really hard, which means this location is lucky.
However, this restaurant needs more servers. Aurora was sweating a lot during service because of being busy within her section. Hiring more servers and reducing the number of tables in each section will help this restaurant get higher guest satisfaction rate.",3
Great food friendly staff. Parking was cheap. Service was quick.,4
Received exceptional waiting service and enjoy our meals.,3
All the staff are very kind and gentle for my family. Thanks a lot.,4
Everything was perfect! Delicious food and excellent service!,4
Only complaint is the prime rib was slightly dry. Just slightly.,4
"As usual, great service, and great food. I will continue to patronize this keg.",4
Good food and service. Accommodating to my elderly mother-in-law.,3
"Disappointing at arrival, we were kept waiting and then they wanted to seat us in the bar even though we requested a table in the dining room for my husbands birthday. they eventually sated us in the dining room but no apology for the long wait.",3
"Great food, great service, great atmosphere. Highly recommended.",4
Prime rib was more medium than medium rare. Flavour was good,3
Excellent food and service. Worth the price. Great location and facilities.,4
"Such a great experience. Hostess that sat us (Amy) was very personable and lovely, waitress McKenzie was incredibly attentive. Food was amazing, only feedback is for the lamb shank special Guinness reduction could have easily been doubled or tripled.",4
"The waiter was great, very friendly and very helpful.
Food was cooked just the way I like it.",4
"For the price that I paid the vegetable portion was very small, not happy with the overall portion of the dish.  Would not recommend because expensive and for what you get not worth it.",4
"Celebrated Birthday with group of 8 people. Service was excellent and food amazing. Restaurant has walls separating smaller dining rooms from each other and tall soft booths, which keeps noise level low.",4
The experience wasn’t to the standard of Keg. I didn’t eat my steak and my table fellows didn’t eat their meals either but only the appetizers were comp. as a “gesture”.,0
"Our server Jon L made the night special.
Steak done right as usual.",4
"Delicious food, excellent service..the keg never disappoints!",4
Good service Good Food Will definately be back for another dinner celebration.,4
Me and my husband went there for date night. We waited over 45 minutes for a food to be ready. He had ordered well done steak and I did medium but they both turned out well done and I had ordered the steak with the lobster. They had completely forgot about my lobster service was horrible manager did comp my steak because it was not cooked the way that I wanted but for a known steakhouse they should really Learn how to take orders properly and follow instructions ￼ out of the other keg locations. I’ve been to this one was by far the worst experience ever.,0
"Mónica the waitress was really nice.
Excellent service",4
Food was delicious but the steak came delivered to us completely rare/raw,3
You can always count on a great meal at The Keg wherever you go. Everything was great ❤️,4
"I felt the waitress was rushing us to order, eat and leave. Her service was subpar AND they force the tip amounts on you. You no longer have the option to select and pay the tip you want, you only have 3 percentages options. I think this will allow the staff to not actually work to earn their tips. I should be able to tip what I want based on the service.",2
We had a wonderful birthday dinner. We had a great table by a fireplace. The food was delicious - lamb and sirloin steak.,4
Always consistently yummy and cooked perfect. Great knowledgeable serv.,4
The noise level was high due to many large groups.  Service was good. Food was as expected from a steakhouse. It was fairly expensive. A free dessert on my birthday was much appreciated.,2
"The food and service was wonderful as usual
Will definitely come back soon",4
Great food. Terrific service. A nice last minute dinner in the lounge,4
I was expecting a cake for my birthday as they did it for my husband on his birthday but for the rest was ok,3
Food and service were great. We were seated by the kitchen which was loud and very distracting. Disappointed as reservations were made and there was no other table available.,3
"We always go to the Keg for the great value in food & drinks. My husband and I had the prime rib but it wasn’t very good. It was more fatty than usual and cool in temperature. I didn’t complain about it, next time I’ll just stick to the rib steak.
Our server Sebastian however was amazing; very attentive and we didn’t feel rushed. He really made our experience relaxed & enjoyable.",3
"Our Steaks were over done, it took a long time to get our meals and the service was slow and we didn’t get the attention we deserved.  As well we keep getting seated in the bar area which doesn’t make me happy.  Tables are too small for dinner.",1
It’s ok. Service was good but the steak was overcooked,2
Great service and as always steaks are excellent.,4
"2nd time having dinner there and the food, service and ambience was excellent.
Our server, Brian was very nice.",4
"First time at this location, VERY nice!! Food was great. Drinks had to send one back no spiced rum.  Our server Valentina was excellent!  Very professional and delightful.",4
Service and food was very good. We enjoyed our dinner and will come again.,3
"Have been to The Keg (and this particular location) many many times and this was probably one of the best meals I have had in all my visits. Service was quick, though we didn’t feel rushed, table was away from the chaos of the bar which I had requested. Wonderful experience for our anniversary.",4
Jasper was a fantastic server. She was very attentive and great choices for our dinner. Food was great. Great job Jasper! We will be back again!,4
Very good place for a special event. Excellent service.,4
"Steaks were good as expected. The salads are a bit of a mixed bag. It’s been a while since I’ve been to the keg but I guess they replaced the old loaves of bread with a ciabatta. But it’s ok. The important thing is the steaks and we enjoyed ours thoroughly. Our server was good, as was the bar. No qualms about coming back :)",4
We had a lovely dining experience. We sat upstairs which we really liked as it was quieter than the main floor. We were served by Monica who was friendly and a great server. Everyone was very conscientious about our food allergies which was very important to us. This was definitely one of our best experiences at the Keg!,4
"Our food came out before our drinks. Service, in general, was slow. For a dinner that costs over $200, we expected a much better experience. Our waiter was a very nice man who was constantly apologizing every time he came to the table because he knew things were slow. I told him we wanted some wine with our steaks but, again, the steaks arrived before we were served our drink. It took another 5-10 minutes before our wine arrived and by that point we were well into our steaks. Steaks were lovely, as always. Fries tasted like they had been sitting for some time. Thanks to our waiter for doing his best.",1
"I really enjoyed my birthday dinner here, the food was great and it was not crowded.",3
Your fire onion improved compare with last dining,2
"Great food as always
We had a great waitress
Nice atmosphere",4
"The food was good. However the sirloin steak that I ordered medium well was too red for my liking. The atmosphere is nice and relaxed . Our waitress was very helpful, very accommodating. Our original table was next to a very noisy table so we were easily moved to another location .",3
You should try with the lobster biscuit. it was excellent.,4
Overall pretty good. Have been many times. Only complaint - salad not very fresh. But good service and steak was good.,2
Was a really good experience and the food was great,4
"Great experience from hostess, to server. Great attention from all staff. Food was consistent like always. Delicious as always and great value",4
"Its better than the first time but they keep bringing us on the same table everytime. If we didnt ask to move on patio we gonna be stuck on the same area again. The food is better, last time its cold. The service is excellent! Ate we gonna go to this location again? Maybe not. Well check out other location.",3
This was our first visit to this location.  We have been dining at the Keg for many years and really enjoyed our experience.  Our server was kind and helpful and we really appreciated that.,4
Always a good experience at the Keg. Service at this location was outstanding.,4
Our server Kristen was fabulous - really made the evening special!,4
Everything was great! Definitely will go back again and again,4
"The food as always was very good although the garlic mashed potatoes were a little beige and looked congealed but tasted very good.   
Our server, Kristen was a congenial young woman who was very helpful in discussing the menu and made the birthday dinner special.   Thank you!",3
Food was excellent and our server Kristen was outstanding. Great attention to detail and very enthusiastic.,4
Always Love The Keg for my Bday....never disappoints and was Great again with some new friends.,4
"Service was great, staff was friendly and created a comfortable atmosphere especially my server. Food was good and tasty definitely recommend !",4
"The customer service and the waiters were all very nice. The food was alright, some meals were a bit better then others. Overall good experience.",2
"The waiter got both our orders wrong
He didn’t bring the wine at the right time",0
"We really enjoyed our evening out with our family.  It is not very often that we can just be adults without the children and grandchildren.
Our server was helpful, attentive and stopped by often to see if everyone was satisfied with their meals.  By the way, the food was excellent.  Thank you.",3
"Our waiter Shawn was amazing
He made the experience great",4
"The food was good as always, although the amount of soup was much smaller but not price!",3
"The steaks were great but the blackened chicken we ordered was just so-so. We weren't also able to taste the onions in the French onion soup. Was a bit too noisy and chaotic where we were seated. Overall though, great place to celebrate a special occasion.",3
"I have never had a bad meal at The Keg!

It’s just across the street from my condo and it’s always perfect!",4
"If you’re looking for excellent, friendly service and quality food this is the place",4
Good food and great service.  The Keg North York location is our favourite!,4
"We had a great night with my friends,
They gave us private room as we were 10 guests,",4
"The patio at this keg location is fabulous. The food was great as always, and the service was next level.",4
"Our app was just okay, slightly over cooked. I wouldn’t have known but they accidentally brought out a second one that looked much better than the one we originally received. One of the two Caesar salads had no dressing on half of the lettuce so I couldn’t eat half of it. We then had to wait almost an hour between our app and main. When it arrived the mashed potatoes were cold. At least the waitress removed the app from our bill wothout us saying anything but it still didn’t make up for everything. Not the Keg service I would expect from past experience!",1
Enjoyed a lovely dinner with friends on the patio,4
"A few reasons I will not get back to this location, because the is happening the third time already.
-the menu prices shown in the web site were different than in the restaurant menu
-the quantity of food less than other location
-the booking system did not work at the first time, I had to book a different location and i the evening I was able to book and to cancel on the other place.
- even we mention in the booking that we were celebrating a birthday we did not get the ice-cream.",1
Before come to restaurant when I reserved I said for anniversary but no cake no candle noting,2
"We were a large party of 9 and our table was very private and quiet as per my request in the reservation. I was positively impressed by that. Service was also excellent!
However, I don’t think The Keg delivers a good value when it comes to food. You get similar or better steaks at half the price in other restaurants. I won’t plan to go back.",3
"Great place, great food! The meals were excellent and service outstanding.",4
One of our steaks had to be sent back twice.  First because it was because it was overcooked and then because it was because it was undercooked.  When it came out the 3rd time it was still undercooked but we didn’t want to send it back again.  The manager took it off the bill but still.,4
I have no comments to add. All I can say is cheaper price is always better for patrons,4
You can never go wrong with keg. Service outstanding and food consistent. It is more expensivee but good value.,4
"Great server. Wonderful food. Love the patio. 
Lovely evening for us",4
"Service was exceptional. My daughter is anaphylactic to shellfish, the server was very attentive to her needs. Food was delicious and hot. Ambience was good.",4
"Though I made a reservation, I was given a table by the bar near the entrance; far from my expectation of a regular table in the main dining area.  A very poor area for dining and conversations.

Unhappy customer.",3
"The prime rib classic dinner was horrible. 
The meat was fatty and cold . The veggies were also cold. There were only four baby mushrooms as an accompaniment. 
I returned the plate and it came back cold again. 

Very , very horrible and for a $51 dinner ! 

I swear that none of the food was reheated when it was returned.",0
"We spent a very nice evening. Very well welcomed and professional. 
Thank you for the service. 
The food was excellent. 
We had diner on the ope terrasse on the first floor and it was a very nice ambiance. 
Thanks again for this experience.",4
"This location was great.  Our waitress took steps to ensure that my meal was gluten free. She looked after all of our concerns in a very efficient manner.  She was delightful

The meals were prepared as requested.  As a bonus, our table was celebrating 40 and 50 year wedding anniversary. We were given complimentary desserts.  

We enjoyed a relaxing meal together.  

I have no hesitation in recommending this keg location",4
"Very efficient service. Appetizers arrived really quickly. Food was great. Steak, seafood and vegetarian dishes were all cooked to perfection. Spacious, clean, quiet and comfortable restaurant.",4
"Highly recommend this Keg restaurant.  Have been before and each time we were impressed with the quality of the food, the attentiveness of the staff and the very comfortable ambience of the place.  Their amazing complimentary birthday dessert scored lots of extra points!  This is a Winner!! Look forward to visiting again soon.",4
"It was great. The table between 2 tables was not ideal but Michelle was the GOAT, really made our night!",3
Good food; excellent service.  Very attentive staff.,4
"A great place to eat and however you want to dress, it has a diverse customer base. The staff (all of them) was professional, pleasant and attentive. Great value for your money too. My husband is a professional chef and from.his opinion, the food was freshly made and tasty. Big thank you to server Issac (and Kristin who wasn't our server but helped to seat us). She checked in on us periodically.  Great venu and exceptional service.",4
Everything was wonderful.   One of the best dinners I've had in a long time and the waitress was fabulous,4
All the Keg restaurants offer great food and service for a reasonable price.,4
"The best part was our server. She was amazing. Prompt, friendly, and attentive. She was super nice to my friend that was celebrating her upcoming wedding this Saturday.

I believe her name was Elizabeth.

A great night and thank you, Elizabeth.",4
"First time at the Patio here and it was an amazing experience.  The waiter was gracious and friendly.  Had the French onion soup which is a staple at any steak house, the twice baked potato and a top sirloin.  My wife had the pistachio encrusted Salmon which was juicy and delicious.

The atmosphere was great and noise level was good to have a conversation at the table.

Overall a great experience and would recommend this Keg patio experience!",4
"We are regulars at this location. Virtually every other time it has been a great experience. This time was not one of them. First, even though we had made reservations well in advance, we were shown to a table in the lounge. We were told that we shd have specified seating in the restaurant. Never done that before. We decided to wait for a table in the dining room. We had to wait a little bit for service but that was ok. All of our steaks arrived perfectly cooked. However, mine came with mushrooms which I specifically said not to & my sautéed onions arrived after I had finished my steak. Our server was apologetic & made good by offering us dessert & coffee. We will return as is our custom but the restaurant shd be aware of the shortcomings that night.",2
Everything was good except the food took long to arrive.,3
"There was a “potato issue” that caused our mains to take a very long time to come out, and plated separately from our potato accompaniment. Manager was apologetic and comped our bar bill and dessert/coffee. Shrinkflation has made meals smaller and more expensive.",2
"Went for my son’s birthday, Chris our server was absolutely fantastic! Chris thank you for making this evening memorable for my son.",4
We had an amazing time celebrating my fiancé’s birthday! Amazing service (big thank you to our waiter!!!) with great food.,4
Alex the employee is a great and very polite guy.!,4
The server (Isaac) was exceptional - attentive to every detail.  The food was absolutely delicious and even better than the Etobicoke location.  Ambiance was cozy - a tad noisy as they ended up sitting a large group of people close to us.  We will go to this location again in the future.,4
"Our server Sebastian took AMAZING care of us. Very attentive and happy to help when we needed. My fiancé had never tried lobster and Sebastian made an excellent suggestion on the wine pairing, definitely would come back to this location just to dine with him because he made the experience so special! 10/10",4
Had a great dining experience at the Keg - North York. Prime rib was done perfectly (medium) and the crème brûlée was delicious. My server was attentive and friendly but not overbearing. It was my first time at this location and it won’t be my last.,4
"Another great Keg experience at Canada's favourite restaurant!  Service was fantastic, the food excellent, and overall just terrific!",4
I like the Keg a lot. My kids like to eat kids meal in here.,4
We were celebrating our daughter's birthday and they loved the stake. Tks for the cake. We had good time .,4
Perfect! Will always return to this location! The bartenders are fantastic!,4
Great time….food! Great service!  We we on the patio and the ambience and weather was perfect,4
We usually have an excellent experience at The Keg.,4
It was Monday night and it showed  Food just as tasty but ambience not there,3
Great food and customer experience.  Previous night we enjoyed drinks and apps on the roof top bar area.  Nice location above the street.,4
"The food itself was great however we had very slow service. The server might have been new but obviously needed more training or was just overwhelmed. We waited quite some time from when we sat down until anyone came by and then they just dropped bread on the table without asking about drinks. Once the food came it was very good.
Also a note that the women’s washroom upstairs was disgusting and needed a good cleaning",2
Always have a great dinner service. I always love coming here.,4
"We enjoyed our birthday dinner due to the exceptional service of Michelle 
She was friendly and attentive without being bothersome 
She answered all our questions regarding the menu 
Con: we had a weird table of 3 that was small and a bit uncomfortable - it was smaller than the table for 2",4
"All very good, with one exception: one of the reasons I kept coming to The Keg, aside from the steaks, was that you were the only restaurant I know of in Toronto which used to serve frites, the real French fries, such as one would get in Paris...

Unfortunately, I discovered yesterday that they are no longer on the menu, and that is a real pity.

Would you bring them back please? Thank you.",3
Service took too long. We waited for awhile and it was not even busy.,1
"Keg dinners are usually very good, knowing what to expect from previous visits.
The service tends to need some improvement, but not bad.
The food could have been hotter and likely sat waiting for a bit longer than it should have.",3
"everything was perfect. I had the steak medium well and my husband had it medium. However, the two steaks were changed and came out. We just switched steaks. Nonetheless, everything was a perfect and enjoyable meal.",4
The dinner was excellent. The staff were courteous and professional,4
"Always a great tasting meal at the Keg. Our server, Armando, was first rate.",4
"We celebrated my parents' 60th wedding anniversary here and my mother has mobility issues. The staff went above and beyond to make sure we were seated somewhere that worked for her! Our server was super-friendly and helpful but not overbearing. The food was very good. My tiny, frail father polished off a huge plate of calamari and a filet mignon. 
The only downside was the family next to us with two young boys who were not ready for a ""fine dining"" atmosphere and all the sitting still that entails. Not the restaurant's fault, but it did make the evening harder to enjoy.",4
Celebrated my birthday here with some friends and the service was amazing. Will definitely be returning in the future!!,4
"Very nice atmosphere. Food was good, caesar salad not exceptional.",3
"We had an amazing evening at The Keg, celebrating two of our kid’s birthdays. The restaurant accommodated 14 of us and we had the most wonderful server. The food was great and it was a fabulous experience! Thank you so much!",4
Always a pleasure at this location. The bartenders on the patio- amazing!,4
"Extremely slow service, tables were sticky, menu was dirty, nobody bothered to refill your water unless prompted multiple times, grilled shrimp was burnt, steak was rock hard, took waiter 15 min to bring the bill and credit card machine. Wont be coming back.",1
Everything was very good. The salad came before the appetizers which was a bit annoying but not the end of the world.  The seats on the patio aren't the most comfortable but happy to have been outside and of course it's a bit loud on the patio with the music competing with the traffic but overall was very pleased.,4
"The food was great (prime rib) the horseradish  was really hot. Service was great.
Thanks for the july 1 2023 birthday cake slice for my wife.",4
"Disappointing experience. Uncomfortable seats, didn’t have the classic Keg feel. Prime rib was chewy and returned more than half - waitress didn’t even acknowledge this. Most of my negative opinion is based on the location only.",2
Service was great. Food was very good. Overall a good experience.,3
The food was delicious and the staff is very welcoming. Thanks. I will definitely come back.,4
I’ve been going to the Keg for a very long time and I’ve extremely rarely been disappointed.,4
"All food tasted OK. I wouldn't say it's the best, but it was alright.. plating is just a standard steakhouse plating. The only reason for lower stars is because I ordered med rare, the steak was medium. I didn't complain because it was still tender.. filled mignon is usually.. and also the server didn't switch our wine glass when we got another wine bottle.",3
"Food is consistently great, but service was very slow.  The level of noise in the upstairs area where we sat was pretty unbearable.  Couldn't hear our conversation across the table!",3
A regular spot and consistently good. Our server Kristen C. has served us before and was excellent.,4
Great experience as usual and food is always very good,4
"Lovely experience. One of my favourite Keg locations, looks beautiful and always has excellent service. Server was kind and checked on us at perfect times. Always professional and a great experience.",4
Server Kristen C is amazing server.  Food is great,4
love  the food and the environment. Only thing that could improve is the service as it was very hard to flag down a server. Other then that it was a very pleasant experience.,3
Great food.  THe sirloin is always delicious and tender which is not always easy when ordering a sirloin well done.  The service is impeccable.  We loved it.,4
Great food as always.  Warm and friendly servers.,4
Fantastic service !!!! Food came hot . Very nice evening,4
We had a lovely time yesterday when we went to celebrate my mother's 70th. Our waiter did excellently he was terrific with us.,4
"Our waiter, Sebastian was truly wonderful and made our experience really nice.",4
Attentive staff and good quality steak. Arrived at our table as per requested doneness.,3
"Hosts should ask clients if they wish to be seated in bar area or dinningroom     Everytime i go they automatically walk me towards the bar.  If find it insulting, why should i want to pay over 200.00 to sit in the bar.  It gets very annoying",1
"Was asked whether this dinner was a special occasion which it was but then there wasn’t any follow up. Everything was good, nothing spectacular but reliable. Food came out a little slow and not all together.",2
"I did not like sitting in front of the giant tv. Too much bright, distracted and uncomfortable.  Service was fine but food was slow.  Bellini was not good.  Billy Miner Pie was the best!!!",3
Everything was perfect. The service food and drink so different than the one in Scarborough Markham and 401 we didn't like that location there is day and night difference between these locations. The on on youg we loved it will go afain for sure,4
"Celebrated a birthday. The ambiance was lovely, the service attentive, and the food, consistently great!
We had a wonderful time!",4
The server and the management and the kitchen were excellent on making sure my allergies were noted and exposure to anything was clearly discussed with me. I felt very safe eating there!,4
"I returned for a family celebration and was seated, as requested, in a quieter area. The service was prompt and efficient. The filet mignon were beautifully prepared, as ordered. I skipped the chipotle mayo as it was weak tasting. I will definitely return!",3
"Everything was high quality.  Fresh, tasty, generous portions, beautiful presentation food, great drink selection,  super excellent service all the way, relaxed beatiful atmosphere.",4
Great steak! Too many different servers for my liking. Our main waiter was fantastic- the rest not so much. Love to patio but cushions need restuffing. Food amazing as usual.,3
The food was amazing!   Our steaks were made just right. The staff were warm and welcoming.,4
"We ordered steak and lobster for my husband and salmon for me. The steak arrived poorly cooked, sans steak knife, with poor attitude from the server. Although they replaced it and offered free dessert, both of us were sick throughout the night with severe indigestion. Bad food quality, bad service. Don’t go!!",0
"Regular guests. Celebrated 2 birthdays! Always amazing-food, service, ambience!",4
If the lamb is still and option don't hesitate plus the service and wine was fanominal!!!,4
"The food was delicious and the service as always was outstanding.  We loved the free birthday dessert!
Thanks",4
Everything was very good and my server was wonderful,4
We loved being outside in casual seating. The food is fabulous and they left us alone without rushing our order.,3
"One of the better keg locations, steak was cooked properly, service was on point. Thank you",4
The happy hour menu is clutch. Our serve was attentive and quick. The Keg North York is our favourite Keg!,4
"Went with my wife and son for dinner on their patio. Our server Amir made some great recommendations. We tried the rack of lamb and it was cooked perfectly. Food, service and drinks were spot on as per usual.",4
"This location is good for date as the restaurant is spacious, they also have rooftop patio. Paid parking is available and walking distance from subway station. Food quality and portion is good. We also got free cake for our anniversary!!! Will go back to this location again.",4
Excellent service.  Our waiter was friendly and very helpful when we had to make a decision about our food.   Everything was yummy.,4
The food was fine and the waitress was amazing-however the noise was too high and the value was just Ok,2
"The rack of lambs as it is stated  ($52 ) is actually three pieces of lamb chops, not a rack . They have no favour and are tasteless, a big disappointment !!! The warm bread is not as good as before, not puffy enough.",2
The waiter was really nice. The food came on time too,3
"We went for an anniversary dinner to the Keg that we had not visited before.  The ambiance, our server, Mark, and the food were all great.  We were seated in the lounge area, so a bit noiser, but not a bother.  Food was very tasty and we were treated to a lovely anniversary dessert by our server.  All in all, a great visit.",4
"Just saw this email.  I ate at the downstairs bar with a friend during the summer.  All good, and wonderful hospitality!",4
"Over all my Husband and I had a nice dinner (we were there celebrating our wedding anniversary).  We both got apps and  mine  was great, but his was over done. My Husband got the prime rib and he said his was great, but I had the top sirloin and it’s was over done  , it was fine, I ate it, but it wasn’t what I asked for.",3
Food and server were great. I specified on the reservation that we were celebrating a birthday but they didn't acknowledge it.,3
"It is a good place to go, particularly for special occasions. Decor is excellent. Food and service are very good. I wish the menu were a bit more expansive in the non-beef sections (I understand it is a steakhouse) and in the zero alcohol drinks section. Staying on top of the trend is not a bad thing.",4
Excellent food. Beautiful patio. Great service. Will go again.,4
"Great night out with friends!
Varied menu with lots to choose from.",4
The food was fresh and tasteful the waitress was amazing 🤩 I will be back!,4
"Finding a paid parking in yonge street itself is time consuming ,to top it food took ages to come...
Service was pretty slow , have been to the Richmond hill keg in the past and inspite of it being busy , the service is pretty good and quick.",2
"The food was very good, all the steaks were cooked per our request this visit.  Our waiter was very very pleasant and very attentive at first but forgot about us at times.  The restaurant wasn't that busy.  Overall great experience I do like this location very much.",3
Delicious as always hostess was great and sat us quickly,4
Seated right away and everyone was really nice our server was great and checked in often,4
"I go there with family and friends quite often. First time I book through Open Table to ensure I get a spot. Ordered the Rib Steak medium rare. Cooked to perfection! Thank You! Try their Calamari as well, it's'awesome and so is their wedge salad with blue cheese crumbles and ranch dressing 
Waitresses were very friendly and were trying their best. 
Reception staff was very friendly as well.

My daughter wanted the brownie unfortunately it's been removed from their menu. Hope they bring it back!

It's my number one place for an exquisite meal!",4
"We were seated in a very nice room with a fireplace…the prime rib dinner was exceptional and the garlic mashed potato side as well!
Nice that the prices at The Keg haven’t gone through the roof after the pandemic as is true at many Toronto restaurants.",4
Had a reservation for 10:45 was seated and ordered.. waited for an hr for food. Server came multiple times to say the food is almost done.. had to end up taking the food to go. Asked for well done salmon and it came out medium,0
The New York pepper steak is perfect! First time tried double baked potato! Amazing! Love it so much!,4
"First time at that location and will not be the last. Service was absolutely amazing, restaurant itself was lovely, well planned space.
Will definitely be going back soon :-)",4
"I was there last week with 5 guests. One steak was full of grizzle, the manager made amends. This week with 4 guests. We ordered more bread which came 10 minutes later with salads. One salad was ordered specifically without bacon as guest is allergic. Salad came with bacon. Salad without bacon came 10 minutes later with steak. Same guest, steak was overcooked. Returned later O.K. 

Not our usual experience at the keg.

We will try again, sometime.",2
Our server Kristen was very friendly and attentive to our needs.,4
Excellent food as always. And the service was just right. Thank you for making my son's birthday a great dining experience.,3
"Always a great place for a nice dinner after work, great staff and location",3
"The atmosphere and interior provides a nice environment to dine with family and friends, however, I would expect higher quality food from a well-known brand.",2
"I was very impressed with the service as soon as I walked in, to the server, quality of the food was amazing.  Looking forward to going again!",4
"Fabulous food and service. Staff attentive and efficient but not rushed.
Our rare and medium rare Filet mignons done expertly. Warm bread and tasty whipped butter delicious. Vegetables tasty and plentiful. Dry Grey Goose martini perfect.
A wonderful Mother’s Day dinner.",4
The Keg was able to accommodate all 8 of us..service was awesome,4
"New York steak is always delicious.
This time, I did not give you five stars for two reasons:
Firstly, I booked a specific number of table (three weeks in advance);
It was occupied when we came.
Secondly, it was my jubilar birthday, and I expected a token of appreciation as a loyal customer (a glass of wine, or a piece of cake, for instance).
However, overall, it was good, and I look forward to visiting you again.",3
We went here for mother’s day and we had the greatest server!,4
"First time at this location.  Didn’t like were I was seated but didn’t complain. Appetizers and dessert were fine  but my main meal had no flavour, non did the jus, fries and fried onions over cooked.  Most likely will not recommend this location.",2
It was the best Mother’s Day! Delicious food and nice service.,4
We celebrated mother's day there. The décor and atmosphere was very sophisticated. The steak was superb.,4
I have always loved the keg. I've been to almost all the ones in the GTA. But this one so far was the worst. Service was slow and waited so long for my meal to arrive. Server started off well but then no where to be seen. Maybe just a bad server. But food service here does not meet keg standards. I recommend any other keg location. Just avoid this north York location.,1
Good service and great food. Professional staff very courteous and friendly. Would like to go back again this summer. Thanks Keg,4
"Please do not serve butter that contains pieces of cheese, herbs and smoked paprika. It was disgusting. It ruined your delicious sourdough. There’s nothing wrong with regular butter. It’s perfect on its own.",3
"When ever I am looking for a reliable place to eat a steak, I choose the keg. Is it the best steak House in Toronto? The restaurant is only as good as your last meal there, I keep coming back so that lets you know that the food is consistently of high quality. Great value and I will return.",4
Best place to celebrate any occassion. They still offered us a complimentary cake despite of not requesting a reservation for birthday.My daughter’s birthday was past 2 days ago and they still complimented it.Highly appreciated and 👍. Good customer service.,4
I spent my birthday at Keg and it was fantastic! The customer service was excellent. 💗,4
"We had a wonderful night celebrating Mothers day early with my mom. Our server Mathew was helpful, kind and very efficient. Overall we have a lovely experience and good food and service.",4
"Great experience 
Good waiter 
Great food 
Lovely 🥰 table 
Water with strawberries 🍓",4
"The service was second to none. My steak was perfectly cooked. And when I discovered that the mushrooms, which were part of the description of that meal, we’re missing, a manager offered both of us the choice of either a glass of wine or a dessert. I highly recommend this restaurant.",4
"Patio dining, celebrating an anniversary and served by Stefani.

Patio ambiance was great, Stefani was attentive and the food cooked perfectly",4
Yesterday we celebrated my birthday on 5015 Yong street. It was our the second time in KEG.  Everything was great! I love your restaurant.,4
The food as per usual was terrific but the service was spotty and slow. Ambience could have been a little quieter,2
"Everything was good
Service was slow - in the past it has been more attentive
Not this time",3
The food was very good. The steaks were prepared as ordered. The service was outstanding. Stephanie was our server & she was amazing - attentive & efficient.,3
Food was terrific as usual. Service was great and we weren't rushed. There were 9 of us and everything was perfect,4
One of our best dining experiences in year! Highly recommend this location,4
"We went for an early dinner to accommodate my grandchildren’s bedtime and to celebrate my birthday….
We had a lovely evening…The server was excellent…he was as gracious to the adults as he was to the children.. the menu for the children was perfect..with crudities to keep them from getting too hungry…..and crayons and activity page to keep them occupied.  Our steaks were perfect…..
We were getting quite warm as we sat right beside the fireplace, so the staff turned it off for us..that was so appreciated..  The ice cream birthday dessert was a great way to end the meal.",4
"A review I never expected to make. A Keg review that is less than glowing! I've had nearly 50 Keg visits from coast to coast and know that exemplary service, clean restaurants, your order cooked perfectly- all in a nice atmosphere is their hallmark. Large groups for work and family, small intimate meals with she-who-is-adored, always consistent. Not this visit. To be clear, nothing really bad happened just everything was a step off. The floor was a bit dirty, the service was a little slow (even had to ask for water - that NEVER happens), both our orders were one level of doneness overcooked. It may have been where we were seated but it was very, very loud. Disappointed. Will not return to this location.",2
Roast prime beef portion was small add very grisily could not eat it,1
"Best value for steak in Toronto. They have steak preparation down to a science and don't charge as much as other restaurants for the same cuts. Atmosphere and service are always great too, not just here but at all the Keg locations I've been to. My only complaint is that their cocktails always taste watered down, it's best to stick with wine or beer.",3
"We always enjoy the . keg
Last night we were disappointed! Our steak was not seasoned well and not hot! Our waiter was energetic but not attentive!",2
"Our NY sirloin was done to perfection and was as soft as butter.
Service was friendly and cheerful.",4
Staff is so friendly. Restaurant is beautiful. Good is amazing,4
"Good food and friendly service here, as always.   Reservations recommended.",4
"Even though we were there at 5:00 p.m., the service was almost non-existent and had to ask another waiter for steak sauce and coffee refills.
The Caesar salad was good as usual but the baseball sirloin was relatively cold.",2
"I ordered pistachio salmon and it tasted great and perfectly cooked. However was lacking presentation as food was on half of the plate and other half was empty. Service was great as our server was friendly, approachable and tentative. Noise level was a bit high. But to be fair there was a hockey game this the crowd was cheering for the Maple Leafs. Definitely not the best time for an intimate catch up. Parking was quite hard to find, and server told us later that we can park on the other side of the parking lot with $5 charge as Keg customer. Would be great if this was mentioned on reservation confirmation as I paid for a $24 parking. Overall very good experience. Will come back.",3
"Great ambiance! Would recommend for a date night, family night, work lunch/dinner. Food was delicious and filling. If anything, you might not have a good service depending on your waiter/waitress.",3
Terrible experience and even worse customer service! We had a reservation for a regular table and they put us in the bar with a sports broadcast blaring so loud that overpowered any conversation. We asked the girls at the front reception to move us and were told they would look but were actually ignored for 20 minutes until we finally asked for the drink bill so we could leave to go elsewhere. We later received a phone message from Scott (maybe the manager?) who told us we should read the fine print in the reservation booking. There was no mention about the blaring sports broadcast. If we wanted a sports bar we would have gone to one. These people have no concept of customer service or a dining experience. Definitely NOT even close to the dining experience at every other Keg we've been to. We will never go back here!! Avoid this Keg location!!,0
Mitchell the server was awesome. Food was great. Love going. Can’t wait to go again.,4
Late came out cold and burnt.  We didn't complain as we didn't have time to wait for another one.  It was not drinkable.,3
"We were very pleased.  I must say anytime I’ve been at a keg, the food and service are excellent.",4
Great place for celebrating a special occasion for dinner.,4
Welcoming staff.  Good location. Great servie. Food is good quality as always.,4
"3 of 4 of our steaks were perfect and one was awful. Tough, couldn't chew or even cut the steak. One bad meal taints the whole table unfortunately.",2
I have been to the keg at three locations just this year and everyone always trusts a good meal to come because it’s the keg. The first location was on hwy 27 and the other on Rutherford near jane. Both times were very disappointing . Service is always good but the food was underwhelming. However last night the food was on point. Service was exceptional and speedy. Everything we asked was done with a smile and in a timely manner. The steak wasn’t just good. It was one of the best I have had in a long time. Great job. I’ll be back to the north York location very soon.,4
Server was so lovely! And the food was GREAT! Definitely going back,4
Celebrated my birthday. It seems Sat evening is quite busy and we had a bit of a wait between appetizers and main course but it was worse the wait. The Keg never disappoints! And the cake on the house for my birthday was spectacular!,4
Our experience was top notch. The food and service were exceptional. I highly recommend The Keg Steakhouse North York.,4
"Keep up the good work, food, and service. A live band would be a good idea",4
"The North York location was amazing. The wait staff was great, the food was great and I really liked the ambiance of the 2nd floor. They also have an elevator for persons with disabilities, as I am. Highly recommend AAA+++",4
Reservations were for a birthday celebration and did not get 🍰,3
We went for drinks and to catch the nba playoffs during happy hr after our movie date. The staff was friendly the drinks came quickly. The place had a good ambiance to it and the patio upstairs was a vibe,4
"Had a great dinner experience at The Keg at the North York, Yonge location. The server was nice, the atmosphere was great.  The food was delicious. Highly recommend if you are looking for a nice place to have dinner.",4
"Keg is never disappointing . Unfortunately is on the pricey side.

Consider having special lunch or dinner menu as people will be able to visit more often . Fixed dinner specials or lunch will be a good way to see your customers more often .",4
"Lots of availability but hosted would not let us sit at a high table. They insisted we sit at the bar. We did, we ate at the bar, many of the high tables remained unused even as we left the restaurant.",3
"The service was slow.....luckily we were not in a hurry, but were hungry.
We asked for extra bread and we didn't get it until our server asked if we had gotten it when he brought the meals. Also, my Aunt had the mushroom caps and you couldn't even see the mushrooms as there was so much cream cheese 'sauce' all over the dish. She usually really enjoyed this dish, which is why she ordered them again this time. Her comment was that she wouldn't order them again in the future.
Having said all this, the rest of us enjoyed our meals and the server was very accommodating. My daughter took some of her meal home and she was about to put the half a loaf of the bread in her box, when he said he would bring her a new one to take home.",3
"Was informed the popular prime rib was running low, then they forgot to update me it was actually sold out, so they gave me the big filet on the house.  Exceptional service!",2
"Sebastian was great. Explained all of the specials and was great with serving the food and the drinks as needed.
The food was great and the ambiance was as well.",4
"It was just amazing! The food, the staff, the ambiance ✨ Definitely recommend and will 100% be back!💫",4
The staff was very friendly and professional. This was my first time at this location and the vibe was on point.  I will definitely return and I 💯 recommend! Great job !!,4
"I loved the corner table that was assigned to us. It was intimate and well-lit for dining. The food, especially the starters ( salad, bread, and escargot) is so delicious and well portioned. The steak is perfect, although it can improve with the side orders like the fries didn't need that much salt, and side vegetables can be grilled too like the steak. 
But, we always come back. Great location and parking is ample",3
I dined  last night. Our server was attentive and kind. The food was great and meat temperature was perfect. I would be back.,4
"The food was fantastic as always but our server was non-attentive, never checked in on us and only took our orders and gave us the bill at the end.",2
"Outstanding customer service, fantastic ambient environment, amazing food. I will definitely come back",4
"A familiar steak house buzz.
Had a good crowd. Service was courteous and efficient.Food was excellent with a good variety.
All in all a fine dining experience.",4
"Great steak but excruciating slow service! We arrived 7:15 on Sunday evening with prior reservation to celebrate a birthday. We were directed to our table quickly and placed our order fairly quickly. From the time we placed our order, We waited about 20 minutes to get our first drinks, 45 minutes to get our appetizers and 1.5 hour to get our dinner. Bread and butter that was promised never made it to our table. Food was good but wait time was stressful on a Sunday night when you plan to start an early day the next day.",1
"Booking was at 9 pm on Saturday, but food arrived only at 10 pm.
We waited a lot. We left after 11:20 pm.
Accept fewer customers or hire more people in the kitchen please.
Automatic HVAC was not set properly, sending cold air to us. Please prefer human feelings instead of automatic device.",3
"Have dined at this location several times and the service, food and value has always met expectations.",4
"Food was excellent. Service was good at the start but then waited 10-15 minutes for server when we were finished and waiting to go. Also, we were asked if it was a special occasion. It was out 34th anniversary but no acknowledgement in spite of them asking.",3
"Great night at The Keg as usual! Food was awesome and our server Michelle made the night even better! Great service, polite, attentive!",4
"Rib steak was great.

Prime rib was dry.

Ambiance was awesome.",3
Server was friendly and personable. Food was delicious.,4
"Perfect evening. Our server, Raf, was excellent!!!",4
"Really nice atmosphere in the dining room. In the summer the second floor open area is outstanding. There is decent metered street parking close by. The washrooms are located on the second floor which is a hike from the main level, but there is an elevator. Service is excellent at this location and food was served piping hot!",4
Very good food and great service.  Pleasant atmosphere for any type of conversation.,3
"Was amazing. The service is very friendly and kind, a little bit pricey, but it worths",3
"We sat in the lounge area. We had a wonderful time. We had starters all the way too desserts.
Food was fresh and hot. Cooked exactly as we ordered. We had tried the crab cakes and they were delicious. Delicate flavours and nice crisp on the outer layer.
We finished with the Apple Crumble and it was decadent.
What a great time. Thanks to everyone.",4
The service never really meets my expectations. This was no exception. will go elsewhere next time we have a birthday. It was just ok.,1
"Our server, who we have had before, combines enthusiasm with expertise and a very pleasant disposition. He made our evening more enjoyable",4
"Delicious as usual 👍🏻
We took salmon and lobster tail.
Amazing",4
"We had a great night! Thank you!
Food was delicious, service was excellent and our waiter was very pleasant and professional!",4
We got great service from Cam.  Steak was really good.  Wedge salad was lacklustre but other wise it was a great meal.,3
Seated downstairs by a big family of youths and by the kitchen. Repeatedly asked by young waiter if it was a special occasion. I think he assumed 2 men eating steak were homosexual. Brought out a free slice of cake for us to share... might be last time I go eat steak here with a friend who is not a woman.,2
"We were celebrating my son's birthday . Service was perfect. The food was great and to have a private room was the best.
Definitely returning to this location.",4
"Friendly and personable hostesses. Table available on arrival. Lots of space between tables. Excellent server, efficient, knowledgeable and genuinely interested in our feedback. Ideal evening for comfort and conversation with friends. Food good and consistently predictable.",3
The caesar and onion soup was just ok. Not impressed with the food as I used to be. At least the prices stayed reasonable not exorbitant like other restaurants. But not so impressed. They need to up their menu and make it more enjoyable to dine out at the KEG if you are not having any beef.,1
"The food was excellent, and the service was great. Elizabeth was our server, and she was really lovely, friendly, and helpful and added to a wonderful experience.",4
Amazing experience. The Keg always seems to go above and beyond my expectation every time.,4
Always a perfect meal for the whole family. And the birthday dessert is so worth it.,4
Very relaxing with nice service and good food. Don’t have much else to say,4
"Food was fine, you can’t go wrong with a steak, there side of vegetables lacking flavour or any sort of spice.",2
"Great place to celebrate a special occasion.  Attentive service, care given to allergies.  Food always delicious. And the Billy Miner pie - wonderful!",4
"The food was much more mediocre than we remember it from 5-10 years ago, the stakes which is their specialty were so so, veggie sides were funny…
Atmosphere we didn’t feel any, dark enclosed space… separated from other tables completely… didn’t enjoy it to be honest…
With $230 bill for 4 main courses they could do better…",2
"It was absolutely amazing! Service was great (Shawn thank you for an unforgettable night), food was amazing - the best steak I have had! Cannot fault a thing.",4
Good environment updated menu bringing crab cakes bakes after while,4
Food was excellent as usual.  Service was a little slow but it was probably due to so many customers.,3
"Nice time to be there , amazing food for us, we are very enjoyed our time and will be come again",4
"Everything was excellent.  I have eaten at this location on two occasions and both have not disappointed.  The food, service and atmosphere were excellent.",4
"Staff need to understand that when a request for a quiet table is made they do not put people under the speaker.  After a change was requested, the music was turned down.  Thank you.",3
"The server, I believe his name was Armando from the Philippines, was outstanding!",4
"Birthday
Great",4
It was a pleasant experience. I would recommend this place to people. Thank you.,4
Love this place. Fantastic steak. Wonderful service. Its my go to place for a most satisfying evening.,4
Delicious and love that they have vegan options. Service is always excellent.,4
It was a great experience and the food was amazing!,4
Food was outstanding! We both had steak and she added the lobster tail. Twice baked potato should never be left out!,3
I ordered the roast beef which came to me with so much fat on the plate. In my life I have never been served roast beef plate like that.  I have been at the keg many times in Toronto and Calgary and never anything like that. Very disappointing,2
"The food was good as always. Was only disappointed as this was for my partners birthday, which was noted on open table and we told the server when we were seated, and there was no dessert brought out to us after our meal. We’ve been here on many birthdays and I didn’t buy him a cake otherwise because I was counting on this. Oh well.",2
It was a great experience. I expected the food to be more tasty though. The service was outstanding.,3
"We all had prime rib.  It was delicious!  

Well worth the money.",4
Very nice modern keg! Good food and service would definitely go back!,4
We love the Keg and regular customers.  This was our first visit to this particular location however and we were pleasantly surprised by how nice the location was and how great the staff were.  We would definitely recommend it and will come back again.,3
"We were not impressed by our server at our favorite location . Confused ,slow and not customer oriented.",3
"We have an excellent dinner yesterday, we were celebrating my wife's birthday and it was such a nice experience. We really appreciate how well our two waiters service us",4
Both food and services were perfect and I really enjoy the food.,4
"Food and service with Leila was excellent! We weren’t really happy that our table was in the bar area, but it turned out not to be very loud there.",4
Our dining experience was great! Great service and great ambiance! Definitely coming back to this location!,4
"Just WOW!, but not surprisingly!  A favourite dinner night out!  Filet Mignon was devine and done to perfection.
Sides too were so unexpectedly delicious.
Our waitress topped off the evening with her professionalism, charm and sweet humor.
Thanks Keg staff!",4
Great service and food.  Very friendly staff.,4
service is good and food processing is fast and delicious,4
Great keg! Modern and very good service!,4
"All three steaks I ordered were burnt black, but judging from the burnt exterior, it seems that they didn't adjust the temperature because they were busy.  I don't want to die of cancer.",2
"Food and service were excellent. Our server, Kristen, was very attentive and friendly.",4
It was really good and that staff was very friendly/helpful,4
"It was a really good experience! Food was phenomenal! Second time being here, this would definitely be my go to location!",4
"Steaks were cooked to perfection. Service was amazing as well, our server/bartender was very attentive.",4
"Everything was terrific. Our server. Jonathan was top notch. The only reason I deducted a star was that I have RA an inflammatory disease and we were seated on the 2nd floor. I found out afterwards there was an elevator but the damage had been done the walk up and down the stairs dislocated my knee. Not the restaurant’s fault but after stating it was our first visit to that location the hostess should not have assumed everyone in the party could do stairs when there was an elevator for guests right on the premises.

As it was also my birthday I was a bit bummed they had no bubbly left. Still, a good time and a good meal and keen attention to detail by our server.",3
Excellent food done right and outstanding service.,4
"Thanks for the excellent service provided by our waitress Madam Stephanie. The blackened chicken we ordered was delicious but a bit salty. We recommend to have it less salty. 

Thanks.",4
our server wasa very amicable and professional her name was,2
Food is always delicious and steaks cooked to our desires. Service is amazing . My only opinion is about the French fries - they could use a little pizazz.,4
Amazing as always. Would recommend to anybody looking for a nice night out,4
"The food was great, service amazing, great value for money too!",4
"An overall great experience.  We went for a celebratory birthday dinner.  The accommodation was fast, service was excellent, and the food delicious.  Our attendant Michelle was very pleasant and helpful.  I was pleasantly surprised with the complementary birthday cake, complete with a lit candle.",4
I thought the server did a great job. Friendly helpful and zero mistakes.. always kept an eye on drinks and used dishes etc.,3
"Great food and excellent service!!!

One of our favorite locations to go out for an evening with family or friends.",3
"Delicious food and professional staff.
However, our dishes looked messy with beetroot stains all over them. On another note, the most important utensil in a steakhouse is a steak knife, which should be sharp. Unfortunately, the knives we were given were dull and required a lot of force to cut through a medium rare steak.",2
"I have always enjoyed Kegs but this was the first time at the North York location, and I must say it was a fantastic time. Service was prompt and the server was attentive. Thanks fit making it a wonderful Valentine's dinner with my wife.",3
Cam was always attentive to our needs when we needed it,4
I love the Keg👍,4
Over priced and we had to wait for mains for an hour and half.,2
Amazing experience to dine in during the busy valentine’s day! Our server Faith is so attentive and her recommendations are all on point.,4
Steak was terrible. Maybe cause it was busy or not. Not a usual keg taste.,2
Great service & food.,4
It was a pleasant experience overall except the waiter has misunderstood my request on our meals. And the manager has to come to defend the situation unnecessarily. Our group has dined at numerous times. But make me feel like I wanted to cheat for a wrongly delivered main course item due to the waiter’s inability to understand my request really spoiled my usual expectations for the Keg’s. Probably will not go for a while.,1
"Had the NY steak  Can never go wrong.
Billy Miner cake for dessert",3
We were able to get a table ahead of our scheduled time. Service and food were excellent.,4
"For a chain the keg really feels like a bespoke restaurant. The service is excellent, it looks like each waitress waits on 3 tables plus a number of servers bring food.  The tables at first glance when you walk in seem a little close but had a corner banquete which was romantic, didn't feel intruded on. 

Had fillet mignon which is difficult to get right, it really has no fat for flavour and is easily overdone but this was bang on. 

Not a wine conisseur so they had a few  lower cost bottles in each category .

They served beets as one of the sides,  something you don't see often. The green beans still had that perfect bite rather than mush you might often  see.

It's been a few years since I have been to a keg, this is a good one. The service and food is still top notch.",4
Food was ok. Burger was meh but the steak was cooked well. Fries were cold. Server was nice. I’ve had better food at other kegs,1
Nice - dinner was what I expected- good. Wish I had known about bread and butter so I would not have ordered appetizer of cheese bread.  Food was great and amount of sides on plate was unexpectedly a large amount.,4
"The food and the service was excelent. Sarah did a great job! 
However, my napking was dirty and the washrooms where very dirty as well.",1
"The Keg is very good and always consistent
Love going there on all occasions",4
"Fantastic service. Our server was amazing — friendly, timely, helpful and very polite.",4
"We are familiar with the Keg have been countless times, always a very pleasant visit. This visit however is the first time that our food was subpar and the first time we were not asked if we were celebrating anything which we were (my wife birthday). My wife's steak was well over done and not edible (was hard like a piece of rubber). We had to wait about 15-20 minutes to get a new steak for her. They initially wanted to offer us free desert but we were not in the mood and it was late already, so they didn't charge us for her meal. We were ready to pay for her meal as they did bring her the new steak but the manager came over and insisted on covering the dinner which was generous of her. I do feel the Keg goes above and beyond in most instances to make sure you are happy and this is why we will not hesitate to return.",3
Our server was from  Napoli. Charming guy. Lots of fun and very efficient,4
Server is very nice and quick response. Food is amazingly tasty. My whole family enjoyed it.,4
Amazing as always food is always good. That bread and apps 😇,4
Nephew in from Chicago.  We can always count on the Keg for great everything,4
"had a lovely evening, everything went smoothly.  thanks",4
"The food was wonderful. The service was alright. Didn’t appreciate being called and then rushed  within 1 min of arrival that we had to get our food order in (by 7:45pm!). Otherwise, it was a good experience.",3
Not a service you would expect at the keg.,0
Birthday.  Brought a piece of Milner pie with candle.   Dry nice.,3
Birthday dinner and the staff was great!  We love The Keg!,4
"If you are looking for a good moment and good food, you can't go wrong with The Keg.  They always deliver, no matter where you are, it should be a Keg close to you. Don't think it twice :)",3
It would have been nicer if they got the temperature right. I ordered a rare and my friend ordered a medium rare. I received the best medium rare I've ever received.  He received the best rare you could get. It's just... not for the right steaks... It was different steaks so we couldn't even swap. Otherwise it was good. A little salty. Happy with the portions. Server was friendly. Reservation stated it was for a birthday. Server could have noted that to up client experience.,2
The flavour of the steak was very good. However we asked for running rare which is between rare and medium rare. It came out medium rare so kitchen skill wise not that experienced. The vegetables was over cooked. The wine list has always been good.,3
Great experience.  Wonderful service.  Good food.,4
"Great food.
Great service. 
A perfect place to celebrate a special birthday!",4
We had an amazing dinner at the Keg! Marco our server is awesome. Very accommodating and very kind. We will surely comeback!,4
Everytime I go to the Keg it never disappoints! #1 Steakhouse! Service was just incredible.,4
Wonderful experience! Will definitely go again in the future.,4
"The Keg at North York was outstanding with Alex our fantastic, attentive server making this birthday celebration most memorable. 5 star rating-highly recommend The Keg this location. Cheers-",4
We fully enjoyed celebrating two birthdays at the Keg North York-the food was delicious and the server was wonderful. We really appreciated the complimentary birthday cake slices that was provided to us for the celebration-soooo good!,4
AMAZING!!! My server Kristen was perfect! the staff was so nice❤️ Hosts angela aurora and cristin were very polite opened the door for me and were very knowledgeable. I LOVE NORTH YORK KEG,4
"Food was as good as always, service was excellent, Christine our waitress was nice and attentive.",4
Filet Mignon was a fantastic steak! Cheese and mushroom apps were great!,4
"Service was timely, attentive, overall very good.
Food was OK, but both the steak and the beans were undercooked.",3
"Our server, Lauren, was fantastic. Pleasant, funny, a joy to have at our table, if I could’ve? I would’ve invited her to join us for a drink.
First time having the vegetarian meatloaf, wow, was I surprised at how delicious it was.
Inventing anything vegetarian can be tricky but I would highly recommend it.
A great meatloaf!
My Bellini turned my cheeks red as it is supposed to, we never had to wonder we’re our server was or wait very long for anything.
A wonderful experience all around! Thanks again Lauren for being wonderful, it was a pleasure being your table!",4
One of only a handful of keg location that cook your steak properly,3
The keg is always solid but seems to have improved on that. The vegetable accompaniment is way better than they use to be. Wine list great and reasonable. Steaks always solid. Service very good!,4
"The steaks have always been of poor quality in this location. 

No taste. Stale steaks. No seasoning. 

More often temp is not spot on. 

Veggies are either too cooked. Boiled to death or almost raw. Last time i had green beans that was literally raw. 

French fries are always room temperature and never hot. 

Mushrooms are shrivelled and no taste. 

Leslie location , Newmarket and hwy 7 location have the best food

Thank you 
Hope i was helpful",1
Food is good.  Service is excellent.  A very enjoyable evening.,3
Good quality of food and service. I came back the 2nd time and had the same experience.,4
Great location with lots of quiet corners for conversation.,4
"Server made the experience a pleasure
Very friendly and polite",3
The keg is consistent. Food and service are always excellent. Always our go-to. We are never disappointed.,4
"Nice and relax in this happy hour experience, great service and good food, will keep coming back with friends!",3
The Keg offers great service and consistently high quality food.,3
I had to send well done steak back. It was still not done when returned. The server was excellent and removed it from the bill. This was not what I had in mind for my wife's birthday dinner with friends.,1
"The Keg Steakhouse + Bar is a popular chain of upscale steakhouse restaurants located throughout Canada and the United States. I had the pleasure of dining at one of their locations recently and was impressed by my experience.

Firstly, the restaurant's ambience was fantastic. It had a modern and classy decor that created an intimate and cozy atmosphere. The lighting was perfect, not too bright, and not too dim. It made for a great setting for a romantic dinner or a night out with friends.

The service was exceptional, and the staff was attentive and friendly. The server was knowledgeable about the menu and helped us select our dishes, which were delicious. The restaurant has an extensive menu that features a variety of steak, seafood, and chicken dishes, as well as salads, appetizers, and desserts. The portions were generous and well-prepared, and everything was cooked to perfection.

One thing that stood out to me was the restaurant's commitment to quality. They use only the best ingredients, including premium cuts of meat, and everything is made fresh daily. The attention to detail was evident in every aspect of our meal, from the presentation to the taste.

The bar also had an extensive drink menu that included signature cocktails, beer, and wine. The wine list was impressive, and the server was knowledgeable and able to suggest a great bottle to pair with our meal.

Overall, I had an excellent experience at the Keg Steakhouse + Bar. The food, service, and ambience were all top-notch, and I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great steakhouse experience.",4
Great food but service sucks. We asked for ketchup and butter - it came almost 10 minutes after we asked 3 servers,2
"A good place to grab a drink and some good steaks. I recommend the ribeye, medium rare and mushroom rice. For drinks they make decent sangria’s and I recommend the Ogier rose wine.",3
The atmosphere and service was perfect. Just the food was a little salty.,3
"Mostly should wait long if requested to bring something.asking for desert menu and bringing 15 minutes later. 
Asking for extra plate, another 10 minutes.",3
I like the food and the appetizers in the Keg restaurants as well as the ambience. I always choose to go there for mine or others birthdays. I highly recommend the Keg for people who would like to go to an elegant restaurant with good food and nice staff.,4
Our waiter Jonathan gave us excellent service with a smile.  The Keg's filet mignon was wonderful and with very nice vegetable accompaniment.  Great dessert choices too.,4
"The delicious food, the beautiful and cozy place, only in the area where we were, the lighting was very low, but we had a great time.",3
"Best of the best 
Everything is wonderful and Imy family are happy",4
"One of my guests had a hair on her steak.  The manager immediately came over to apologize and offered her a new meal and would remove it from her bill.
He also compt my glass of wine and sent us all home with a free dessert.
This was excellent customer service!",2
Everything was delicious. Great options for kids.,4
"As always, excellent food and good service. Only slight criticism for volume of music and people all around having to communicate with loud voices. Suggest turning music down a little when staff notes that customers are spending more time in conversation than listening to the music.",3
Great service and food,4
"Great food. Service was terrific, especially for New Years Eve. Crowded but noise was very low. Wait staff was attentive, friendly. Loved it",4
"Great service from the time we arrived until the time when we left. Marco was a very polite, friendly server and made some recommendations. We will definitely return",4
"Overall a good night. Was our first time dining at this location, we will be back in the future!",3
"We went to The Keg for New Years Eve dinner. Our table was ready when we arrived and we were promptly greeted by our server, Cam. He was outstanding. We ordered appetizers, entrees and dessert. Our food came very quickly. We were very surprised at how fast we received our food given how busy the restaurant was. Cam was quick to see if we needed anything (refills, menu assistance, etc) and was very friendly. Overall, this has been our best Keg experience in Toronto.",4
"we came for happy hour time, but we didn't get the happy hour menu,",1
"Booth seating does not allow comfortable eating position.
Perhaps add cushion/cushions in lumbar / back area to position
the patron closer to the table to eat their food.",3
"Dinner wasnt cooked properly.
Appetizer was too fulling",1
"Delicious food. Impeccable, knowledgeable staff",4
Service and food perfect. I recommend.,4
"I was very pleased with our server, Faith. She is the most professional, helpful and kindest server I have had in a very long time. The quality of her service was excellent.",3
Price performance always excellent at The Keg but table too small to put foods and wines on,4
Steak was terrible fat and sinewy. Chef should never have put on grill. Very dis,2
"My husband and I were quite disappointed tonight. We were celebrating our anniversary and we love going to the keg. This was our first time coming to this location, we were super excited because we have never had a bad experience at any of the other locations. Our server didn’t ask if we were celebrating anything special tonight and usually that’s the first thing they ask. I had put in our reservation that today was our anniversary and expected the service to be above and beyond how it normally was, since we were dining at our favourite place. We got there at 6 pm for our reservation. We finally were able to order and it took nearly an hour and 40 minutes for our food to get out. Seeing other tables get their food before we did and we ordered first, showed that it was unorganized. We had a couple of servers place bread when we didn’t order extra bread and our server almost brought our drinks to the wrong table. Our server was super nice and kept checking up on us, it was the long wait time. A table of 8 even clapped when they got their food because they waited long as well. Tonight just didn’t feel like a great experience especially since it was such an important event
for my husband and I. I don’t think I’ll be returning to this location.",0
"Staff was pleasant and attentive, but not over bearing.  The food was very good.  One of the few times I left a 25% tip.",4
"Great food, great atmosphere and great service! The Keg does a great job.",4
Dinner with friend. Food was good for the prices. Server was ok,4
"Its a good place and food is good.
Thanks for the wonderful experience.",4
"Las night dinner was absoluty good the drinks ,meat andsalad was delicious . Thanks to Sebastian for the help and explain all of kind of meat are good he did good job . For us was a plus because he speak english and Spanish better for our guest doesnt  speak english . Thanks so much to Keg and Sebastian soon we will return .",3
The food was very unseasoned. The glass had lipstick stains. The tables were very close to each other.,0
"Fantastic food, service and ambiance. I would definitely recommend this location.",4
This is a steak house that does that part well. It's not a place for a special occasion or for the right ambiance. Having made reservations does not mean you get a spot that's out of the traffic or without a clear view of the entrance or the kitchen.,2
Clean and well appointed. Seated promptly and a good table. Server was excellent and helpful checking with the kitchen several times about allergies,4
"Steaks also pretty good. However the table was obviously  way tooooo tiny for our family(2 adults, 2 highschooler)
There was no room to put down our knives !!!! 4 plates filled the whole round table .
I felt like being getting a cold reception.
REVISIT definitely would not be considered !",2
We had a reservation and they put us in an awkward spot with very little room. I expect a better table when I have gone to the bother of making a reservation. Steak was good. Service was good.,0
Attentive service and always great food!,4
Amazing as usual! Baked garlic shrimp and crispy cauliflower were to die for!! Our steaks were cooked perfectly and everything was very flavorful. Our server Elizabeth was friendly and attentive. Thank you!,4
"Celebrated my sister birthday here, they allowed me to drop of her cake earlier and brought it after main course to surprise her. Everything was great, from the food to our server and worth the price. Will definitely come back again.",4
Our server Was amazing!,4
"Hubby and I were celebrating our anniversary. Everything was excellent. The food was delicious, my steak was cooked to perfection- i like it med- well and it was delicious. My double baked potato was delicious too. Not overcooked as some reviewers suggested. My wine was excellent and our service was top notch. Our server was very attentive and just an overall pleasure. She got everything spot on. We will definitely be returning to this location!",4
The quality of the food was great and consistent with the Keg experience and the service was excellent.,4
"Food was amazing and good
Value. Service was very
Slow compared the usual.",3
"Service was excellent, prompt and attentive. Our waters were refilled and menu item selections were flexible.
I ordered prime rib classic that came with caesar salad to start, mushrooms, beets and green beans on the side and fries. 
The vegetables were a little too salty (beets perfect). The caesar salad was a tad under dressed and the croutons could have more flavour to them.
We had a mushroom cheese starter along with calamari. I found the calamari slightly underfried. The breads with the mushroom cheese and complimentary bread were wonderful.overall the experience was enjoyable but definitely the vegetables were slightly over salted and prime rib was slightly over the medium rare that I prefer (but it was good nonetheless)",4
"Not the best keg, Service was fair, food was a long wait. Celebrated my birthday here but not the best day for me.",1
"Amazing service, delicious food, absolutely happy with my experience. I kind of wished the ambience was a bit more chill and quiet, but I guess it is the Christmas season and people are celebrating with friends and family so it is hard... maybe later in the new year. ;)",4
Always a great experience,4
"We find that when we want a very good meal, or entertain someone, we choose the Keg. 
It is consistently good and the service is very very good. They go out of their way to accommodate your needs.",4
"Keg is usally a good choice for decent food and a good atmosphere.

You can count on consistency.",4
It was my birthday and the Keg was the ideal place to have dinner,3
We had a lovely time on a snowy day. The food and service was very good.,3
This is one of the newer and better locations. Great management and lots of parking around here. I eat here at least once every 2 months an dit is consistently great,3
We always enjoy the Keg.,3
good food with excellent service provided.... no complaints about the experience.,3
great place lunch with customers at good price at nice location,4
"Very nice experience and overall great food. I ordered the steak and lobster tail meal. Lobster was amazing. The steak was nicely seasoned and the perfect temperature (medium rare). However the cut used was not the filet mignon I'd expected and was a bit 'chewy'.
We were there for our wedding anniversary and the staff, atmosphere and overall experience matched our occasion. 
My wife was happy with her prime rib selection.",3
"We made a reservation 2 weeks prior to our visit but were shown to a table in the bar area on arrival. Having made this reservation we expected a table in the dining room and asked to be seated accordingly. We did get seating in the dining room but sat as others who arrived after us received attention. Finally a server asked if anyone was looking after us and when we answered no, he attended to us. As he later explained, the table we were seated at wasn't assigned to anyone and he had to get permission to serve us. Very poor organization spoiled our dining experience.",1
"Marco is a very Good anfitrión , really nice guy and help to choose Good food",4
Another amazing meal at the Keg North York. They were able to let us move tables to a more comfortable spot and noticed they helped others with that request too. Service is always amazing,4
Great service and the food is delicious!!!,4
"Great service and tasty food, but oddly one member of my party felt sick after their meal",3
"Scott and host staff at the front were excellent upon our arrival.  Our party did not all arrive together so I am not sure if this was the reason why we were not asked for drink or app orders right away and also why no bread was placed on our table.  

Our server seemed a bit abrupt and not very attentive but not rude.  Thankfully the dresser was comped as it wasn’t what one guest thought it would be.  We were seated by the kitchen so it was a bit noisier due to staff in the kitchen.  

I have been to this location a few times and generally it’s very good service.  The food is always on point.",3
"They were out of prime rib by 7:30, service was incredibly slow, veggies undercooked and VERY unevenly salted (not spiced. There was no spice..), steak tasted unseasoned and was undercooked. Instead of providing a new steak they put the same one back on the grill... The Caesar salad was the highlight of the meal which is incredibly rough for a steakhouse",1
"Server was nice, but overall everyone looked unhappy to be there. Food was mediocre at best - beans were hard, steak was just fine. They ran out of every vegetation option and we had a vegetarian guest at the table. First manager didn’t seem to really care, second one came over and compensated her meal which was nice, but honestly, no plans to return.",2
"The food was on point steak was tender and juicy. All very fresh. Server was helpful and not overly attentive which was nice.
Place was clean and not very loud. Recommend for sure.",4
"Truthfully the worst dining experience at this location.  Waited 75 minutes for dinner service and the food arrived incomplete. Part of the meal was taken back to reheat once the missing portions were served, then the tabled items went cold.  The server had to be constantly searched for by other staff.  No concessions offered (i.e. wine, apologies).  I asked for a manager and all that was offered was to waive the cold food which we had canceled. Horrible client service.  If dinner service was delayed over 90 minutes, the staff should inform clients as such.  The ambiance at this location was extremely loud (an average of 88dB according to my watch during the time inside). I absolutely will NOT return or recommend this location.",1
"Everyone loved their order ( party of 6) . My peppercorn steak was great, ordered medium rare, looked more medium, to be honest and not the best cut of meat, but pretty good. The twice baked potato was hard like a rock on the outside, seriously over-done. Never again. The calamari as usual delicious and the scallops in bacon just DIVINE. All in all, quite enjoyable, excellent service, and we will go back",3
"This was a very good experience. Everything met or exceeded expectations. The waiter was terrific.
We will be back.",4
"Aasnath the bar room server was very friendly and informative, my friends loved the food and ambience, music was good, staff were great",4
Great service great food!,4
Great meal for a special occasion.  Jonathan our server was excellent and provided everything we needed to enjoy the meal.,4
Everything was great,3
"The restaurant was very busy, but the service was great and the food was consistently very good.",4
"We had the lobster dinner was perfectly cooked, 
Excellent choice.",4
"The staff food waiters were very friendly and professional 
I and my wife had a very good time",4
It was a special occasion and everything went perfectly. It was just by chance that I found Open Table and made a reservation in just seconds. From there to the very end everything was perfect. We all had the Prime Rib and raved at every bite. We have nothing to complain about. We love the Keg.,4
"My husband and I took my elderly parents out for dinner. It was their first time out for dinner since the start of the pandemic. Our server, Sumin, was A+ for her level of service and care. She was friendly, prompt and by making my parents feel relaxed to enjoy dinner, she gave a delightful and stress free dining experience to our family; it was elegant but friendly and relaxed level of service. We all agreed that our steaks were exceptional and my husband had to personally comment on the perfect cook of his steak. We found out the chefs name is Kent…so Kent thank you for making outstanding steaks!",4
Great service. Good ambiance. Delicious food served in a timely manner.,4
"Always a great meal, dependably delicious at a fair price.",4
"Service was slow, waitress didn’t ask if we were celebrating a special occasion, when reservations was made we mentioned was anniversary, no desert was provided",3
Overall a great restaurant for families or couples. Price is reasonable for the food quality.,4
Ambient. Friendly staff. Generous portions. A great place for a steak dinner.,4
Food as always delicious. Steaks prepared perfectly. We felt a bit rushed though. Salads were removed quickly and steaks brought in rights after. Would have liked to relax more in between.,3
"We went to celebrate old friends reuniting after 30 years. The service was very attentive and the food delicious for the most part. I was a little disappointed with the rib steak as it was underdone and tough, but it wasn’t enough to spoil the evening. 
Desserts were delicious and our guests were impressed. 
Overall a very pleasant experience.",4
It was great experience both on food and enviroment!,4
Amazing staff members and perfect for any occasion.,4
"When you go out for dinner, especially to commemorate a special occasion,  you have certain expectations, The Keg never disappoints or fails to deliver. The entire staff from the hostess who seated us to the waiter who served us to the manager who checked on our satisfaction were very accommodating and eager to look after any and all concerns. To comment on the quality of food goes without saying, five star all the way. Whether a special occasion, a special treat or just a change of pace The Keg is always a good choice. Highly satisfied and recommend. Enjoy!",4
Everything was good in total but the place was too dark😅.,4
Will be back once a while. Good but kind of expensive.,3
Bday and out of towner visit.,4
"Great holiday feature- the Kansas City Strip Loin 18 oz of medium rare goodness with veggies and a double baked potato. Second dinner at Yonge, North York location in month and was great.",4
"Everything we ordered was very good and presented nicely.
Any special requests were met as well.",3
"Food was great.  Our server Marko was very attentive, great service.  Will be back soon for our next dinner.",3
Delicious meal as usual. Service was great and we had a good dinner.,4
"I have an issue with the Prime Rib being cut and left under the lights too long. It gives the meat a rubbery look.

Prime Rib must be served immediately after it’s been cut off the roast!

Very disappointing for Prime Rib. 

We came specifically for the Prime Rib.",3
The food was delicious. The service was at the best.,3
"Delicious food, great service, I love this place",4
Beautiful restaurant with nice fires. the staff were very friendly and helpful. Good dining time available,4
"Great experience, service was friendly and food a pretty good!! Would recommend",3
The Keg is always consistent and deliver a good quality steak time after time.,4
We were seated quick and our food came out really quickly too. We had a great experience.,4
Usual quality and value for money.  Steak was great and came as ordered. They know how to cook steak. No problem getting special attention on condiments on side.  Wine priced well.,3
"Our server was amazing, as was the Manager. Our steaks were undercooked and this was addressed. Otherwise the meal was delicious.",4
58 birthday,4
Great food with fast and friendly service. Typical noise level for a restaurant of this size,4
"It was ok
The service was was expected
The baked potato was not hot the butter was not melting",2
The service was exceptional and we did not feel rushed. As always the food was very good.,4
Perfect dining experience with fantastic service! The hostess & server were very accommodating & overall handled the entire evening perfectly!,4
Expensive but good for a special occasion. Great service,2
"Celebrated Birthday with the family. Our group of 7 was easily accommodated. Attentive service, amazing food and great ambiance. Could become a family tradition…",4
"Perfect experience, food and server as always!  Always a great experience!  Thank-you!",4
Excellent! Most Especially to the service in serving our food!,4
Great spot. For impromptu Friday night meal.,3
"One of the best restaurants around.
Quality and service always consistent from location to location",4
Best location I use to be a Leslie street patron but with the lack of service there this is my number one !,4
"Had the steak and lobster. While the steak is not quite at Jacob’s level, it is very reasonably priced. Lobster was great! Ambience was mellow and quiet, we had a great time. It was our anniversary and our server was kind enough to bring us some desert on the house, which as very thoughtful. All in all, I recommend the keg.",4
Greetings at the door was cold. Gave us a small table near the bar as if  we didn't make any booking a week ahead. Service was very slow. Server mixed up our bills.,1
"I have been there 4 times and each time I did reservation prior to my arrival but each time they had an excuse to keep me wait and giving me a table that I did not ask for it to seat. 
Last time I was there I specially asked for upstairs and not close to the kitchen table; when I arrived there on time instead they took me to my table they made me wait and in the end they wanted to push me to seat somewhere at ground and very uncomfortable bar area. When I complained then they gave me upstairs location. Their excuse was they are low on server upstairs but when I complained then all of the sudden they had open space upstairs with enough servers. Also the food the meet was not fresh at all 
It was hard to chew and not fresh. 
I am not going there anymore until they make the place more respectful to their clients and hire a more polite and people person hosts. 
Thank you.",0
I love the new location at yonge and Shepard. Billy Miner pie is a must.,4
"We had a wonderful experience. Great service and delicious food as we remembered from past times.
Thank you for the great service, table and high quality food.
very nice ambiance.",3
"The service was probably the worst we have ever experienced at a keg restaurant.
Very hard to justify going back especially when they did not take anything off the bill and the manager did not take ownership for how bad the service was.
Best of luck to them in the furure,",0
"The Keg is always consistent and people are very polite. We would recommend the Keg to everyone. 

The service was good",3
"Server did not start us with bread or waters, which has always been automatic in my experience at the Keg. Everything else was wonderful and to my high expectations of dining here.",4
Lovely dinner at the Keg. Food was top notch!!!,4
"The servers were careful and attentive. They helped us to choice the dishes, always were near and did not make us to wait. The dishes were excellent as well.",4
Both the host & the waiters were super friendly. Very satisfied with the service and the food. I like that they have kids menu. I would recommend to my friends to this North York location! Great place for dinning in with special guests!,4
"Service was not very good
Plates not cleared 
Kept having to bother other servers for water appetizers 
She need to be more attentive",3
Great service. Great food. That's why I continue to bring friends here and come back regularly. Thanks!,4
Thought of going to keg for the prime rib but they were sold out when we got there . Drove all the way from Scarborough for this to no avail. Ended up eating a regular sirloin,2
"Our server was excellent , evening was very nice.  You have changed your hours so when we arrived we thought you did not open till 4 but our reservation was for 3.  We called and they told us it had changed, but we almost were going to go somewhere else.",4
Birthday disappointing that even with reservations that wanted to seat us at a high top right at entrance to the bar we said no and sat at table in lounge one seat on a chair and one on a bench not great!,3
Yes I would I love the place it was nice and quiet the food was delicious and for a good price too my server was great and funny. Totally enjoy my time there would go back next time.,4
Great service and food. All the workers are very organized and easy to talk to. thankyou sfo a great service.,4
Excellent experience,4
"Food was great as well as the server. But we were rushed and asked to leave the table after 2,15 hours because a bigger party was booked. It would be good to know that there is a chance you get asked to leave after that time. We would have had our dinner somewhere else.",2
Reunion  party. The meal was ok but not fantastic. Service was the bare minimum. Had not been in over 10 years and was not really that satisfied.,2
Good food and nice service.,4
"good news is that the food was great, and the service was terrific.....but they need to replace the steak knives with a model that has a serrated edge...the straight edge knives were dull and became a topic of conversation.  And the place is a little noisy......hard to hear your guests.",3
"Had a reservation but had to wait to get seated because the server wasn’t at work yet???? Then was offered a table with high chairs in the bar area, mind you it was a reservation for 6 including kids so not sure why it was offered. Mashed potatoes had no salt or very little and was not like the usual keg potatoes. Waitress was ok but seemed nervous the whole evening like she was scared of people. Wouldn’t recommend this location which was my first time. Will stick to the other locations where everthing is as expected with the same experience.",2
Was very nice. Unfortunately we were placed in the bar area as opposed to the dining room so it wasn’t as nice / intimate / romantic as I had hoped. But otherwise food and service were fantastic as always.,4
It was a birthday. Food was great. Server was polite and kind,4
"Our server was outstanding.   She was very knowledgeable and gave us great recommendations.   She helped us to have an unforgettable night out.
Definitely is a place to go back many times.",4
The steak was ordered well done and was totally crude,0
Food was not as per usual standards. Service extremely slow and non personal.,2
Great time and consistently good.,4
"We had a great night tonight, ordered a couple apps, drinks and our main. Our apps were great we had the calamari, stuffed mushrooms and beef tartar all three tasted great. To drink I got a red sangria which was very good, one of the best I've had. For the mains I had blue cheese filet which was perfectly cooked and tasted great! Unfortunately the Pino Noir I was looking forward to having was out of stock so the server quickly and very professionally suggested a different wine pairing which I also enjoyed! At the end of the meal the waitress informed us that due  due to some apps coming out late, server accidentally breaking a glass (which was no big deal to us) and not having my preferred wine we were provided with dessert on the house, which I was pleasantly surprised mainly because the ""errors"" were not a big deal to us but I am glad our server and The Keg kept our experience very professional. I will be back at this location for sure, great atmosphere friendly staff and great food! Thanks for the great night !",3
"we just randomly decided to go to the Keg for dinner. My gf ordered an amoretto sour, it tastes weird, and totally what we had before. When ask what was in it, the ingredients weren’t even what it’s suppose to be. Luckily the steaks were good, but the service was so so only.",1
"Dinner was very nice. We eat there at least once a month as we live close by.
The food is always good",3
Service was great. The food was great except the steak was a little salty. Other wise great experience.,4
"Food is always excellent, consistent.  Wait staff is friendly, attentive and provides excellent service.  For the steak you receive there is not better value period.  Can you find a better steak, sure, but it will cost you double if not more.  And the one at the Keg is already excellent so why would you go anywhere else.  

Ambience is great and again service is excellent.",4
They premarinate steaks so cannot eat steak you just want salt or have an allergy to the marinade. Mixed drinks were sub par. Free birthday cake slices are amazing.  Service was great too.,3
Great food and service. Our server accommodated us when our coffee order was not good.,3
People seated too close on both sides of us but other than that amazing server and food delicious,4
"Service was amazing, food was great, prices were reasonable, what else can you ask for?",4
Service was slow and messed up order. Food was good otherwise,2
"The restaurant is lovely.  We were facing a fireplace. The lighting over out table was perfect, not too dim.   We had calamari which was great.  The bread was great, I ordered the lobster dish. The lobster was quite good but the mushroom rice was dry and did not have too many mushrooms. It was exchanged for garlic mash.  My advice is to make the vegetables more interesting. My husband had the ribs which he enjoyed.",3
Had issues with my wife’s steak as it was burnt and we had to wait for 30 minutes for another! Sucked to eat on my own for my birthday but the Steak they brought out the second time was great!,2
"Wonderful and attentive waiter - brought us complimentary champagne for our anniversary. 
Food was delicious as always",3
"Burger was great. Steak slightly undercooked but good-tasting. French fries were unacceptable - not fried to level requested, probably from frozen, and certainly not hand cut. Order service was good but delivery service wasn't great - request for condiments was promised but not delivered. Overeall, a mix of good-to-very good on the one hand, unacceptable on the other.",2
Quality of food great as usual and server was fantastic.,4
Caesar salad was soggy and baked potatoes were just warm and overcooked. Steak and prime rib was good. Appetizers were good.,2
"The server, Marco, and manager were outstanding.  I was in a group of 6 people and they were very attentive to us!

I ordered the lobster tails and fudge brownie and they were delicious!  The wine was also very good.

Thank you",4
Always a good time at the Keg. Food is consistent and you always know what you’re getting. Filet was made to perfection,4
"Food was perfect
Service was perfect 
Price was reasonable",4
loved it. food quality is always consistent. ambience was good -- a little too close to the front door but it was ok. waiter was excellent,4
"The Filet Mignon was perfectly roasted to the point as desired as well as the combo Steak and Shrimps. 
Very friendly staff.",4
Lovely atmosphere. Good food. Good service. Overall great evening! See you soon!,4
thanks for amazing night!!!!!! Delicious food and Wonderfull service.,4
"We usually go to The Keg in Ajax (went last Sat) or the Keg on Leslie Street if we are meeting friends from Mississauga. Leslie St. was fully booked last Sat. so I found an opening at Yonge St. We were disappointed at the slow and poor service compared to Ajax. Our bill was over $450.00 with a tip of 20% ($74.00) I should not have given them. Anyway, we had apps and drinks before dinner, which was fine then we ordered wine with our meal the meal came (was a bit cool, and did not complain) but the wine came halfway through our meal very poor. Some staff needs a little more training on being more attentive to their customers. Enough said, I probably won't go back to that restaurant and will stay with Ajax. This may be a little harsh but we are used to good service.

Kindest Regards

"Great food and ambiance. Friendly staff, although we felt a little forgotten by our server at times, but she was still great. Love this location. Highly recommend.",4
"Our meals was amazing, especially the Tuna Tartare, very delicious.  Service was good, but he forgot we were here for birthday , until after paying he remembers.",4
"We had an excellent time at this Keg! Our server/Bartender was amazing, provided very in-depth descriptions of our cocktails and checked up on us as needed. Will be back!",4
Great service and consistently delicious prime rib!!,4
Everything is very good,4
The staff was great. The food was very good. Visiting from Memphis. Would definitely come again.,4
Everything good except for room temperature which was uncomfortably warm,4
"No matter which Keg we’ve been, the experience and food is always consistently great.",4
"The food and service was amazing 
Thank you guys for an amazing experience",4
"The keg never disappoints, food cooked to perfection.",4
We always have a great experience here,4
"Atmosphere and service were terrific. Appetizers were ok, nothing special. Calamari, Cauliflower and the Brie dish. 
Everyone loved their steaks and accompanying sides. The salmon eaters enjoyed their dinner. The chicken was quite good, but it was described as Blackened chicken, and it definitely wasn’t blackened.",3
Preferred better seating had reservation for 2 but wasn’t offer a booth people came after me were given a booth.,3
"I’ve chosen the Keg for my birthday family dinner, and it was a great choice! Super ambience, tasty food, fancy atmosphere. Definitely recommend it for a good stake or a date night.",4
Had steak and lobster tail. Very good. Asked for med.rare. had more rare side so service was good to cook it more. Overall experience was good and come back again.,3
I usually love coming to the Keg. This time I found the lobster to be tiny and the steak was dry. The portions were not worth the price. The service was very good.,2
The Keg has gone from being a bit better than a sports bar...to being full sports bar quality. Good for a casual lunch or dinner.,2
"Our server gave  us excellent service.  He was thoughtful and helpful.  We were celebrating a birthday and his offer of a cake was greatly appreciated.  

The food was very good but on the pricey side

Overall we were very satisfied and recommend it.",4
Background music was too loud.  I was there with a friend to catch up on news. Had to ask my friend to repeat herself a few times. My hearing is excellent.,4
"Everything was as expected.
On the reservation site it asked if we were celebrating a special occasion and I highlighted ""Birthday"" and there was no mention of it during are time at the restaurant.
WHY ASK!",3
"Was my mom’s 75th bday - had made this known in my reservation notes and to our server - wasn’t provided any bday cake until asked (after our bill was given) - when provided, had to ask another server for a candle (even though the table across from us had one provided with their cake).

Packed up a doggy bag and was provided a takeout box with no bag (again, table across us appeared to have their food nicely packed in a bag) …as a result, our food actually was mishandled/slipped and fell on the way home.

Also noticed after I arrived home - on our receipt we were charged an extra $3.50 for a kids drink - even thought it was supposed to be included with the meal.

I’ve always had great experiences celebrating birthdays at other Keg’s…unfortunately this one wasn’t up to par.",2
"The Keg is always consistent, with lovely service and delicious food. 19 out of 10 experience! Good value for money.",4
"Our Keg Classic Prime Rib, New York Strips and Base Ball steaks were all very tasty.
All cooked perfectly to medium rare. (all the meals, although very tasty, were  expensive;  Base Ball Steak Keg Classic $50.00)",3
The service was great. The server made us felt comfortable.,4
"Excelent personal service (waiter and host). I can’t  say same about food, just good.",3
"Server extremely rude. She said “pass me your plate” not as a question but because she was too lazy to pick it up herself. Table beside us who came 30mins after we did received their food at the same time as our table. We waited over 1hour for our food and 15mins for any server to even show up at our table. What’s the point of making a reservation? Was “compensated” with a “I’m really
Not sorry for my behaviour but we took care of some things on your bill for you”. Terrible experience that will leave a bad taste in our mouths. We frequent many Kegs and this was by far the worst experience. Food for thought.",1
The Keg is two blocks away from my home.  I took a friend out for dinner and we both had an enjoyable evening.  The food and the service were very good.  I always choose The Keg in my neighbourhood.,3
"I had to ask to be moved from the bar to the dining room and they had lots of availability and then i ordered the cauliflower meal which tasted terrible
Overall I like the Keg but this trip was a bad experience",3
"This is the second time I came here and  will not return. First time I sat outside and was informed durning my meal,(should of been prior to sitting us down that the fan was broken). We were all sweaty trying yo enjoy a meal.
Last night we sat on main level which  had a musty smell from the couches in the booth. The restaurant was completely empty and they sat 5 people at the table right next to us and can hear the entire conversation. Why would you not seat people a few tables away as the restaurant had nobody else as we had dinner and left.",3
"Good food, pleasant environment and  good service 
I suggest to add music to reduce table to table interferences .",4
"Seating on the patio is extremely uncomfortable. Other than that, service and food was great!",3
"Always good food and service

Bunch of parents saying goodbye to their kids for college cute",3
Birthday dinner,4
"Great food, great service.  Really made me feel special on my birthday! Server was attentive and amazing!",4
Our server was very polite and attentive to our needs which we recognized and appreciated however in terms of service and food quality it was not the experience we normally enjoy at the Keg.  Service was disjointed and drawn out.  Half the pre dinner cocktails arrived while the other half of the table waited 15 more minutes. We waited the table to be cleared after each course for an inordinately long time. Steak cuts were not great and inconsistent across the table. The pistachio salmon was dry and salty. Essentially the flow of service from the time we ordered to receiving our food was disappointing.  The staff seemed inexperienced and not used to teamwork. We hope this gets addressed soon as we do love the Keg experience.,2
"One of the best keg locations in the city! Beautiful facility, professional service and better tasting than other locations.",4
Striploin was tough. Next time will order the filet.,2
"We regularly visit this Keg location. We are obviously happy and satisfied with their overall ambiance, food and service, to frequent it. Thank you",4
All the appetizers and mains were done to perfection.  Great staff and ambiance.  Wonderful night.,4
"We had a very pleasant dinner at the Keg.  It was our 62nd wedding anniversary.and the staff helped us make the occasion  memorable with a complimentary dessert, lit with a candle Our waiter was very attentive and caring. Being in an upper age bracket, we cannot eat as much, so my husband  and I shared a lobster/ steak combo. Next time we go we may just order appetizers and a drink.  Thank you to all.",3
Wedding anniversary,4
Food was great. We were seated near a fireplace. We visit the keg very often and unfortunately this time we weren’t asked if we were celebrating anything and I had put in our reservation that it was an anniversary. Other than that it was awesome,4
"Food was amazing, our server Johnathan was the absolute best. Drinks were perfect. My boyfriend proposed, and Johnathan brought out complimentary champagne for us and our photographer. Overall wonderful time!",4
There was a mix up with our reservation on the roof (my fault) and they accommodated our request at the last minute!  Great service!,4
"Sat on the patio. It’s very beautiful. Faces the street and looks North on Yonge st.
Good seating comfortable. Nice breeze and the patio has beautiful plants as well. Very nice space.",4
Food and ambiance was good. Service was kinda slow.,4
"Service was not good, we were forgotten about several times and it took forever to order drinks and food",1
"Our server, Daniel, was great. Very helpful and friendly. We had a good time.",4
"Prime rib was medium rare as requested.  Salmon was perfectly done, juicy and not dry.  Brussels sprouts improved from last time which was dry.  Overall excellent dinner!",4
"Celebrating Anniversary as we had done many years. Food , waiters were great.

We were given the Billy Minor Pie at no charge to celebrate this special day.

Got the bill gave a 20% tip and went home where I checked the bill and found that 

we had been charged for the $10.00 desert. My fault for not checking the bill.

Called the restaurant who  apologized and said they would take care of on my next

 visit.",3
"Servers/Staff were very professional. Food is pretty good. Right now the Lobster menu is available.   Didnt like the ""dancy"" music but was quiet enough where it doesnt bother me.",3
Izac was excellent server! He made my birthday dinner even amazing. He was very thoughtful and professional. I strongly recommend the Keg North york location :),4
"Overall had a pleasant experience, professional and efficient staff, clean and very tasty meals. Will definitely be back",4
"Patio was great, food was good",3
"We had a great time on the Patio. Our server, Elizabeth was very attentive and made sure our needs were met. The staff is great at this location. My lobster tail was very good. My husband enjoyed a large nachos that had steak/beef on it.
The atmosphere was great. 
We will be back.",4
Great food and service!,4
I celebrated my 25th birthday here! Super nice!,4
The food and service were great as always. Will go again and again.,4
"Impeccable service and  great steak 
This location never disappoints",4
Sat at 2nd floor patio. A perfect perch where you barely know that you overlook Yonge St. Our K1 martinis were fantastic and always reasonable compared to the higher end downtown restos. Standout appees were the shrimp cocktail and Caesar salad. Wedge was meh this time around. Fried cauliflower is tasty and a large dish. Opt for something healthier like the tuna. The 12oz New Yorker was outstanding. The Keg delivers as usual!,4
"This location gives a very good ambience compare to other locations.
I will recommend to my friends or company to come to this location for special events.",4
This was our first time at this particular location. The service was great and the food was delicious.,4
"Steak quality has gone downhill. None of us were happy with our steaks- tough, tasteless, no nice sear. Too bad.",2
My daughter and I dined for her birthday and she loved her meal and birthday dessert.,4
"Outstanding burgers and during happy hour, great price.",4
"We dined together with 7 people including my 93 year father who is very hard of hearing. The energy in the room and the sound level of music and background chatter allowed us to engage in loud conversation without feeling self-conscious. Our server was very polite, helpful and patient and we felt well attended. When we received our bill, we all felt that we had received very good value and would not hesitate to come back for another dinner soon.",4
Everything was fantastic. Server was amazing! We had one difficult person at our table who sent their food back and server plus manager came over and did everything possible to make her happy.,4
"Service was terrible. Ordered bread but had to ask twice till it finally arrived. No wine offered with dinner. Water was not refreshed. My entree was not what I ordered. 
15 minutes until someone took our order.
My wife said we have never experienced service like this at The Keg ever.
I guess we caught a rare off night but will not go back to this location.
Our go to is Leslie & the 401. Service there is outstanding.",0
"The food is great as always. Steaks were slightly over cooked to what we ordered (husband ordered medium rare and it came as a medium, my son’s was medium well when we ordered a medium). My prime rib was well done even though I ordered a medium, the server was very kind to quickly change my order for me.

We had a lovely time and will definitely be back",4
Every thing was very good the sorbet was very good and the food was hot,4
Thanks Brandon for the excellent service last night.,4
Great alternative location from the Yonge and Ellington location. Our server Arista was amazing.,3
"Another amazing evening! Food was delicious and our server Oreste was very friendly and attentive! We love celebrating at the Keg, it never disappoints! See you soon!",4
"Great food, great service.",3
"Server was not attentive to clearing dishes. Another server who attended tables close by seemed much more attentive to her tables, asking everyone she sat if they were celebrating a special event. I was actually there to celebrate my 50th and my server never asked. Food was great and bussing staff were great, server was terrible.",3
Enjoyed the food. We especially were pleased with the service.,3
"As always, we had a terrific dinner!  The lobster was great., your staff are very well trained & we had a lovely evening.",3
The experience was amazing and recomend it for sure.,4
"Went for a birthday celebration with 2 steaklovers so it was good, steak is not really my thing but had a small amount so it was nice.",4
Dave was awesome,4
My server did not check on my food after I received the appetizer. We need extra utensils and none of the servers or busser tried to see our table and bring cutlery. Horrible experience on special occasions. The steak was too salty and the server was busy talking with coworkers by the bar. I was looking for my server and even though I contact my eyes with other employees they seemed to not care about that. My first visit to this location and a big disappointment. It was just a sad experience overall,1
Our server was excellent. Food was delicious. A large party of about 35 men came in and sat near us. The noise level was terrible. Could not talk to my guests. Did not order coffee or dessert.. could hardly wait to leave. This was a bithhday celebration that ended on a sour note. No one came over to see if we are ok or do we want to move. I will not be returning. I should have been informed about this large noisy party before we were seated,3
It was very busy. The young man who was serving us was so pleasant. The food took quite some time and one order wasn’t right. He apologized and got us a free dessert. I appreciate a place that owns up to mistakes and makes it right for the diner. Excellent food as always,3
"We sat in the private dining area. It was perfect. Server was attentive and also was able to entertain the kids when needed. Food was hot and delicious. Portion was also good. 

We will be back. 
Thanks again.",4
I had a wonderful dinner. Everything was perfect and service was amazing 👍,4
"Service was poor. Forgot to bring water and bread, had to remind the sever. Forgot to bring a drink as we waited 5 mins with ours before we can toast for a special occasion. They sat us approx 50 feet from the kitchen doorway - not pretty with the noise and smells. Server didn’t process one of the $50 Gift Cards I presented - I question his integrity.",1
Birthday was great.,4
Fantastic greeting as we entered the restaurant! Server  Alexis was outstanding. Food was well prepared and delicious. No lengthy wait times.,4
"Food was amazing, all of the staff were super friendly and took the time to get to know us.",4
"Great meal, fast service. Our waiter was very friendly and checked back often to make sure we were good. Definitely would go back",4
"I had reserved a booth however a member of my party was unable to sit comfortably in it. No problem! The Keg staff readily found us another table that worked better for us. After dinner (which was so good), our party moved to the rooftop bar for a nightcap. This rooftop bar is a hidden gem. It was a great night!",4
Delicious birthday dinner!,4
"We go to a different Keg every year on our anniversary, and this location didn't disappoint. We celebrated our 9 year anniversary at the North York Yonge Street location on the rooftop patio. Service was great. Friendly, knowledgeable, timely. Food was equally as good. And we received a free dessert at the end.",4
Food was good value for money. Our private dining room was cozy and quiet. Very helpful and cheerful staff and parking was easily accessible. We will definitely go back again.,3
Best part was our server !,4
"Our evening was made perfect by Oreste, who looked after us the whole evening. It felt like he was exclusively devoted to us, even though he had a full section and a birthday party of 20+ people. My whole party agree that this is the best Keg in Toronto for food and drink quality, service and ambiance. Highly recommend this particular Keg location.",4
"Tooooooooo noisy
Tooooooooo noisy
Tooooooooo noisy
Tooooooooo noisy
Tooooooooo noisy
Tooooooooo noisy",4
"The prime steak is nice and juicy, very nice medium rare.
The brownie is mediocre, not really special. 
The twice-baked potato is served in a decent portion, however the fries are a bit inadequate as a side .",4
Great food and service. The ambiance could be better - the oval table was not the best shape for acommodating 5 people. Also the couch or carpet smelled a bit dusty,4
A favorite of ours for Happy Hour. Great burgers; even better martinis.,3
Loved the way the sitting areas were set up. We always go there for special occasions.,4
"Wonderful meal, and wonderful service.  Waiter was very good",4
"Salmon was pretty good. 
Cheese cake dessert was a bit small for the cost",3
The food was perfect as always.  The patio was lovely but loud.  Our server was attentive and knowledgeable.  Consistently a great experience at this Keg.,4
Food was over cooked. Was very Disappointed with it for the cost. Wouldn’t go back. Quality has gone down.,2
My steak was rare. I ordered medium well. They took it back to cook more and brought it back well done. The waiter was great but I didn’t want to send it back again.,2
Always love coming back! Great steaks and food all around.,4
"The steak was not worth the money for us, very bland, no taste. Would not recommend.",2
"For great quality steak, the Keg is the spot to come to. They also have excellent lobster and scallops, as well as some options for vegetarians.",4
"The lady who attended us was great. She was warm, knowledgeable and personable.",4
Ambience is great on the outdoor patio.,3
"Good, but in the initial reservation I asked for a booth.  We were seated at a table in a not very good location.  I asked to be moved to a booth.  We were moved and the rest of the evening was excellent!",4
"Great atmosphere, friendly staff and tasty food. Will definitely return.",4
"I asked for the food to be served with time between courses. It was not done. Other than that, food was good and atmosphere was good.",3
Good money for value and high quality menu. Recommend onion soup and fillet mignon. Cant go far wrong.,4
"Visiting Toronto from Singapore.

Loved The Keg Steakhouse @ North York!  ❤️

Great ambiance and delicious starters, mains, salads and dessert.

But most of all the staff were simply fabulous!   They make the difference between just another “good” restaurant, and a “great” one!

Keep it up you guys! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽",4
Good experience!,4
"Great service, food good as usual, nice drinks and atmosphere.",4
Our server was kind and efficient. The food was great. This particular Keg is superior to most others,4
"The food and wait staff were amazing. 

We did not enjoy the extremely disturbing table Next to us with 6 children breaking plates, throwing food. We felt bad for the staff who were taking care of that table.",3
"Great ambiance, excellent food and excellent service!",4
Always a 10/10 when I come here! Great food & service every time,4
The rooftop patio is phenomenal. It's comfortably spacious and inviting. I'll definitely be back.,4
"Overall food was very good. One of our party that have the vegetarian cauliflower option thought that this could have been much better.

Service was very good.",3
"Service was good and friendly, food was excellent as always!",4
"Cooked to perfection,the meal was amazing!",4
I did reservation for birthday party before I’m going there I asked them to design and put the ballon and cake before I’m going there but they forgot and also lost my ballon’s and found it after a minute I didn’t expect that  and the dinner was disgusting.,0
"3 out of steaks not done to order, for example-  rib steak was overcooked on one end and completely raw on the other, veggies not hot and undercooked
waited long time for water",1
We sat on the outdoor rooftop patio and it was lovely!   Impressed with the staff too!,4
"Waited over an hour for food.  
And had to ask server for eta. 
All she said was that it’s backlogged.",2
"Plate hot, Food warm, not hot. Not as tasty as other times.Food took over 40 minutes to come",1
"I usually have great experiences at The Keg restaurants but unfortunately this location did not meet my expectations. First off, the menus had food/drink stains on them from previous customers. Second, we waited about an hour and a half for our main course to arrive from the time we took our order and had to constantly remind the server or ask other servers to refill our drinks or order more alcoholic beverages. Third, once we finally received our 4 separate steak meals, all at medium or medium-rare, 2/4 steaks were absolutely well done and dry. The server noticed the fault and did not offer to make the proper corrections. We were told that the kitchen was “backed-up” and we were starving, so we settled for what was given to us. Most likely will not be returning to this location.",0
Really was not great.  Overbooked and the kitchen could not keep up.  Slow .  When dinner arrived it was overdone.  They comped my husbands meal but honestly that was not enough to make up for a ruined evening.  Highly unlikely to return.,1
The meal went smoothly until main course was delayed one hour for us and  all tables around us. Food came out at cooled temperature.,2
We arrived early to the restaurant and were seated right away so I appreciated the flexibility. Our server was very nice and the food wa great!,4
"This location has a reservation service available which is a big bonus (even on high traffic days/events), it certainly helps the ease of dining out. I hope other locations are able to incorporate this into their system too.

Food, service and ambiance was great overall. 

Suggestion back to the kitchen...balanced portion sizes - kid size sides were larger than adult or maybe I was just that hungry!",3
"Great customer service and food, as always, delicious!",3
The food was amazing and our server Cam was excellent!,4
"Great food, great service. My daughters birthday and dessert was on the house. Great night",4
"Great experience (like always)!
Great food and great service",4
The best steak house!,4
Good service and great food.  KEG consistent. Will return.,4
Graduations,3
Ribeye steak ordered Double Chicago Medium Rare was perfect!,4
"This location was amazing. I really loved the fireplace upstairs and the setting it was very relaxing. The keg is always top level food and service 
I really like the patio at this location too. I encourage everyone to go to this location:)",4
"The staff from reception to table service were first class.  We were shown to our table (7 guests) and helped by 2 servers during our visit.  The restaurant was busy for a Monday evening an it took a while for our meal to arrive but the serving staff kept us updated on the progress at regular intervals.  
The food was good but not exceptional and I thought the prices were more than what I would have expected although the last time we ate out in Toronto  was pre-Covid and surely they have increased since then.  Most of our group went for either Seafood or their signature steaks, there were some shared apetisers to start the meal which were OK but nothing out of the ordinary.  
We had ample food after finishing our meal and decided not to have desert until two large Icecream ""share"" deserts were complimentarily delivered to the table. 
If I could offer suggestions on the menu, our group consisted of 5 adults and 2 Children (11 and 13)  Nothing on the Kids menu was appropriate for this age group and their choices on the Adult menu was too large and expensive, there was nothing in between.",3
The manager settled it well by taking care of the bill. I hope to try again and have a different experience.,0
Amazing food/place/staff! Will revisit for sure. Highly recommend 👍,4
Great service. Great food. We enjoyed our evening,4
"Very poor service
Waited 20 minutes for a cup of coffee, had to ask 2 x to bring bread, when I requested a steak knife it was brought by hand ,not on  a plate or in a napkin.
VERY UNHYGIENIC !
Food was over priced, moderate portions and lacking flavor.
Kegs realty gone down hill !",0
"Me and my boyfriend always come to this location and it’s the best! Great service! Amazing staff, food is always too tier. I also love that the place is always clean. As well as the bathrooms!",4
"Awesome service by two servers who helped with my special birthday cake request for my friend and even offered to make our fries extra crispy. Great ambience. The drinks and food were tasty, even though my steak was slightly overcooked. My friend and I stayed all night and felt no pressure to leave. It was a great dining experience mostly because of the service.",4
Our server was missing a bit more than we would have liked,3
We ordered the steak Oscar and it was by far the best we've had. We've visited many Kegs and how they grilled the steak at this location was fabulous! We will definately be visiting again. Service was also amazing.,4
"Food is a little cold when served, and icecream tasted like freezer burnt.",2
"Great, as always. Service, food, prices, location, decor! Way to go!",4
"Food was pretty good, per usual. Tables/parties were not too closely seated. Our server, Oreste, was great and we enjoyed his amiable personality. I was on a low-carb diet, so I swapped their delicious garlic mashed potatoes for the cauliflower mash, which was a pleasant swap. Good experience.",3
The steak and the drink was poor ...tasteless...certainly wasn't expecting it to be this poor,0
"Tuna tartare is excellent!  Steak was very chewy, not tender at all, it was ordered medium - medium rare.  I ordered a wedge salad on the side and it came in a bowl that made it impossible to manage as it needs to be cut with a knife and fork, I tried but it was a very clumsy bowl to serve something that requires you to use knife and fork.  Eating it was a struggle and I gave up.   Wine was excellent, service good but overall not food I'd come back for.",3
Everything was excellent except for the steak. It was overcooked.,4
Amazing food and service. Beautiful patio just a tad busy for my liking. Lots of people walking around you. Would still definitely recommend the patio though.,4
"Good service, good food, no need to have TV screens on.",3
Can’t go wrong with the keg! Awesome patio! Always a go-to spot.,4
My steak was well done by my request and was simply cooked to perfection!!,4
Alway excellent! Fun! Great annual visit to this location but enjoy others as well!   Congenial wait staff and happy and engaging.,4
"My mom and I love our witness Sue, she is so lovely and understanding!

I am vegetarian! My meal isn’t tasty! I knew it’s hard to prepare vegan food!

But I believe The Keg can do better!

Overall, me and my mom have wonderful dinner!
Thank u Sue, and reception!",4
There was about ten times more emphasis  made by our server on getting customer feedback over things like-- delivering wine in a timely manner.,3
54’th anniversary. We are regulars but food was not up to par. Salmon not cooked and steaks lesser quality than usual. Manager was great and made the bill right and offered extra coffees and dessert.,2
First time my waitress helped a lot Service was outstanding,4
"My family and I are frequent guests of The Keg, so when my 5th wedding anniversary came around there was only one place I wanted to celebrate it. I booked a reservation online and in the notes mentioned that it was a special occasion and that we would like the brownie sundae as our complimentary dessert. We got to the restaurant and after telling the hostess of our reservation we were seated at a small table in the bar area. As normally happens at the Keg we were NOT asked if it was a special occasion. We ordered a salad which came out wilted and looking the opposite of appetizing. We were given dirty cutlery which we cleaned ourselves and the rest of the meal passed uneventfully. Needless to say we did not receive our special dessert and we left disappointed and dissatisfied. I have apologized to my husband for this awful dinner that we were so looking forward to.",0
"Nice location. Seated quickly. Great server. Sadly, my sirloin was covered on one side by a tough gristle that made it impossible to cut and essentially ruined the meal for me. In retrospect, I should have sent it back but when your name is Karen, you tend to withhold your complaints  …",2
The low seats and oval tables were difficult to eat comfortably,3
"Reservation error.   Booked patio for 600 pm and confirmed with hostess who called and virtual. We were told that we never confirmed and thereby no patio seat.   No apologies.  We were reluctantly offered a table and told a hostess would bring us.   Then the hostess said just walk up ourselves.  We were not given a cocktail menu and requested.  10 minutes later did not receive and went to the bar to request. 
Food did not come as ordered.  Had to get corrections. 

However food was good, patio was nice and mostly we received good service.   

I’m assuming that staff is new and still in training as we observed errors made at other tables.",3
"Did not enjoy the side vegetables of sweet potato and broccoli, they were undercooked and dry. The steak was not as tender as I remember it .",2
"The service and staff was excellent and friendly. 
Thank you.",4
An excellent variety of menu choices and of course the steaks are great.,3
Amazing service by Suman! Always a good time at The Keg.,4
"It was fabulous dinner . We enjoyed the dinner,  specially delicious ice cream cake to celebrate my birthday, and it's on the house. Thank you",4
Great location and service. Food is excellent as always. I'm a regular now !,3
"The server was absolutely incredible. Very friendly and kind. 
It’s time to turn off the heating lamps outside",4
One of the best Kegs in Toronto,4
"in spite of the restaurant being empty, we we seated by the kitchen exit where all the wait staff ran into each other.

my first salad was made up with brown lettuce cores and i had to send it back.

steak was rather thin, not a grill mark on it, noticably smaller portion of mashed potatoes than my companion, and my vegetables were cold.

i've been going to the keg for years, this is the first time i've had such a lackluster experience.  given the choice, i would cook my own dinner rather than go through that again.  i hope you improve soon.",0
"Love the bar lounge. A bottle of wine, couple of appies, an order of ribs - great evening!",4
"Great service , nice ambience and delicious food as usual!",4
The service was great. This place has always been my go to.,4
Birthday for my granddaughter,4
The seats in the lounge were uncomfortable & the loaded nachos they served weren’t loaded at all. Too little toppings.  Beer wasn’t that great too.,2
"KEG is always the same - exceptional. 
However, there was an addition, a beautiful surprise for my birthday.
Thank you and see you soon.",4
Great layout and atmosphere. Very kind wait staff and manager.,4
"Dear support team, 
The reason that I decided to write the survey is the service was so slow however the restaurant was not busy. 
My family and I celebrate a special day and we ask several times for some bread and it's taken almost half an hour to bring it after our food is done. Also, you asked for extra spoons that we never get it. 
We can not deny that the environment and the food quality were perfect. 
Thanks",3
Keg is always consistently good. Baseball steak is my favorite.,4
"Food was Underwhelming, undercooked & uninspired.",1
Our server Shannon was fantastic!  The food came out fast despite the busy dinner time and the restaurant was packed.,4
"We had a wonderful dining experience. Food was terrific service was great. We were allowed to dine yet didn't wait to order drinks, food, tab",4
Celebrating my boyfriend getting accepted to law school! Was surprised with a small bottle of champagne from our waitress so we could make a toast to celebrate! Always feel so special at the Keg! Thank you for the experience!,4
Food was as delicious as it has always been. The service: WOW! Armand looked after us extremely well. He is a super server.,4
The food was great as always and the service was excellent.,3
"great service, must go back. more bread would be nice",4
The Keg is great.  Tried a few meals from their 50th anniversary menu.  The mains were great but didn't like the desert ordered.  Service as usual was excellent.,4
Lovely Mothers Day dinner! Excellent attentive server,3
"The service was impeccable, we felt we were really being taken care of.",4
"Service was great, if I remember correctly Victoria was our waitress. Never had to request anything as she was always ready and on top of everything! Will return",4
Food has always been great at the Keg however I don’t think they staffed enough for Mother’s Day. Took an hour before we received our entrées.,2
Amazing waitress. Whitney made our visit exceptional,4
"Marko was a fabulous server,  very attentive but not hovering!!
Food was great",4
Service was horrible and took the servers forever to just bring wine or refill water,1
Love the Keg for its consistency. Unfortunately our steaks were not cooked as requested and we had to pour our own wine.,2
"Great place, food and service!  Always a great time!",4
Food is great! And the people are very accommodating.,4
Marco gave excellent professional table service. We never felt rushed. Our prime rib roast was tender and tasty.,4
"Always consistent, great atmosphere at this location!",4
Service was great & attentive. Keg rarely disappoints,4
Server could have been a little more attentive,2
Great Service  can they include something similar for the desserts for Lactose Free?,4
"The level of service at this Keg is very high, and it is a well-coordinated team that ensures your experience is not lacking in any way. Delicious food ordered from the 50the anniversary menu was delicious. Cocktails are well mixed and presented smartly. A welcomed anniversary treat was our Billy Miner pie being on the House. All around a terrific experience.",4
One of the best kegs ive been to! Great service and food!,4
"Although presumably never guaranteed, we expected, as we requested several days ago, a private room on the second floor.  The private room was given obviously to a larger group which unfortunately reflects more of a money grab than anything else.  Very sad when profits come first, ethics second.",2
Had a fantastic server that was very patient and very kind.,3
screaming kicking kids at table next to ours. they were jumping on the bench and the steak was a little undercooked. We weren't served water until we we asked for some. they didn't ask what occasion we were celebrating or ask for dessert.,2
"Everything was great but the seasonal veggies (carrots and broccoli) seemed very unseasonal, the carrots were also cut up like cubes, just made the meal feel cheap, while the potatoes were pretty good, they looked like play dough. The filet mignon was perfect.  To be honest my favourite part was the free anniversary cake lol, it was delightfully delicious.",3
Zofeya was amazing very knowledgeable the manager solved my one problem quickly and to my satisfaction,4
"Looking for an enjoyable night out?
The Keg is the perfect place to go.

The food quality gives you reasonable value. The service is efficient yet casual and very pleasant. The server always seem to be there when you need them yet not hovering. The ambiance is casual and still perfect for special occasions.

I’ve been a Keg fan for over 40 years.
They never seem to disappoint. Knowing that if there was a problem they would do what’s necessary to correct it.

They get my seal of approval!",4
"This place is great! Atmosphere is chill and cool but the staff is also really friendly. We had a guy on training and he knows what he is doing and what he is talking about, and you can tell making the customers happy is their main priority. Food is pretty good and for their prices it’s 100% worth it.",4
"Great food, beautiful ambience, lovely service... totally recommend!",4
I had some dietary restrictions which were easily applied to my meal. Loved my steak and everything was fresh. Overall it was a good dinner (a little pricey) but I was happy with the food and service.,2
Overall the experience was quite good. The only issue I had was that this was my first restaurant experience since the Covid restrictions were lifted. I was  surprised that the reception desk and waiters/waitresses were not wearing masks. I was concerned. That is just me. I would have been more comfortable if they were wearing masks. Otherwise my Keg experience was very good,3
"My husband salmon neptune was excellent, but my New York strip needed more trimming before cooking. I was not pleased with the amount of chewy uneatable part of the steak presented to me.

It was by far the worst of all the dinners we have had there.",3
"This place is always a must to visit. Fantastic food, excellent service.",4
"Not happy no one of the staff  wore masks
Food
Wedge salad too heavy dressing
Tuna tartar too bland
Ribs also under seasoned",2
Always a great experience! I highly recommend visiting the Keg for a delicious meal.,4
"The atmosphere was very good 
Food was great service was great 
The dessert list looked good 
Wish there was more choices  
Lol Like something with coconut 
I will be back",4
"We ordered steak+shrimp from menu, which has 2 prices. Small one $44 and big one $48. We ordered the bigger size which is $48 and When we received our bill we saw there is $40 for sirloin steak plus $14 for adding shrimp. And server told us i think you asked for the biggest size!!!!! Is there any biggest size for $54 on the menu?!! It’s a kind of cunning",2
"The three main courses  and their accompanying veggies were excellent - prime rib, salmon and rib steak - I cannot recall having a better tasting rib steak.  The kids smoothie was excellent.  The wedge salads were ok - not a lot of flavour and there was some brown areas on the lettuce. 
Service started out fine but attitude seemed to shift and we all felt it.",3
We came for my Grandma’s 79th Birthday. She really enjoyed her experience. This location is very wheelchair/ walker friendly. Our server was super friendly and helpful,4
Our party was well taken care of. Elizabeth was amazing and food was wonderful.,4
Food exemplary. Service exemplary. Really comfortable and inviting atmosphere.,4
We had a nice time in the lounge/bar area. I love the atmosphere and lighting. Our server was very attentive and the food was great.,3
Great food and service!,4
"Excellent meal & service. The only qualm I have is the entrees took longer than expected to arrive, but otherwise we had a great evening.",3
"Our server was excellent, as always. The Keg is a reliable favourite.",4
"Although the restaurant is nice and clean but The overall value is dropping with time. 
Good things:
Nice starter warm bread
cleanliness 
Very well mannered staff
Areas of improvement:
Still with all the price increases, when you pay between 40-50 dollars for a meal. It should wow you with everything. Taste, presentation, nutritional value…etc. Non of our plates fit the above.
Staff could get busy at certain times specially around weekends. In a restaurant at this level, there should be enough staff based on the time of the day. This is not a reflection of staff performance, there should be just more of them at certain times.",2
Great experience from beginning to end. Our Sever was fantastic! Bubbly & nice yet efficient!,4
"Best service! Sooo impressed! I was at Morton’s last weekend and keg is 100% better!!!
Great job!!!! , great attitude, service impeccable! Food amazing",4
"Great food, great ambiance and we fully enjoyed as we always do!",4
"The NY Striploin was amazing. I feel like the seating arrangements could be a little different, I was sitting infront of the bar and there were people walking by my chair and bumping into it",4
"Went there for a birthday and had a great server, loved the food & the overall experience. We also got a generous slice of cake on the house which tasted delicious! Overall fantastic lively ambiance and will definitely be back!",4
We enjoyed our evening as we always do with good service and food.,3
"The place, food and service was great, we enjoyed our night out.",3
"Just one issue.  Steak ordered medium well arrived medium and had to send it back.

They gave us a free cheesecake slice so all was forgiven",3
My husband and I attended on a Monday evening so it was very quiet and most enjoyable.  Our server was super helpful and we were quite surprised to experience this kind of service from a chain.  The food was a little pricey but considering we ordered steak really can’t complain.  All in all I would give it 4 👍,3
Love this place.  The food. The service. The ambiance.,4
Service was spot on. Food was delicious. Nothing beats that bread n butter.,4
Usually the Keg is great. My experience at the Keg near Yonge and Sheppard was very disappointing.,1
Not happy that we booked a table & got put in the bar area across from the bar.  Was constantly getting bumped when staff was trying to seat people & by the customers trying to figure out where they are sitting & also by the wait staff trying to get through.  Did not feel safe as majority of the staff had no face mask on.  Would not feel safe returning to eat again as of now.  The bar area was getting really crowded.,2
"Always consistently delicious food and great, efficient service.",4
"We brought our 3 and 5 year old girls for dinner fairly early, at 5pm. We all had an amazing time! First family dinner out since the pandemic. The food was excellent; our server was wonderful and we can’t wait to come back to celebrate another occasion.",4
First time back at the Keg for almost 2 years because of the pandemic! It was perfect! Great service! Great food and a perfectly cooked steak! Loved it!,4
"The service was great, meal was good we enjoyed",3
"It was the combination of things that went right… Smaller room but open ,close to the fireplace, great service and you can never go wrong with the prime rib.

And although prices are higher than in the past certainly reasonable  considering the overall experience And in comparison to their  peers",3
"Food was excellent as usual. Service was terrific, friendly and server let us dine, not in a hurry.",4
"It was a nice experience, amazing food n the service overall.. the music choices were soothing in the moment.definitely recommend",4
"My sincere apologies, but steaks used to be much better...",3
Very mediocre food with overcooked and over spiced steak,2
"In Hamilton, there is no additional charge for extra black pepper sauce. I didn’t have enough yesterday. The little jar was only half filled.",4
"Our waiter Marco 
Was outstanding , he was the perfect fit for our group , professional and attentive but not overbearing .
The keg has always been our choice for a guaranteed good night with quality food .
If I could add only one complaint It would be that maybe a little less salt could have been used .",4
"We were sitting at some weird part of the restaurant that felt more like a living room where you sit and have drink and watch tv, surely not eat. It was very hard to eat there. The oval tables, huge chairs and tall seats. Horrible. We were very close to the bar and I don't know if that's the reason for the loud music or not but it was too loud. People come to restaurants to eat and talk, not have a disco party... Our server molested us coming every 5 minutes. My cutlery was taken from me in the middle of me eating my steak. And one final thing, the prime rib steak could have been better. We ate a few weeks ago at Eglinton location that same steak and it was amazing, the fat on the meat melted in your mouth. This one had fat that was very chewy and it felt like the steak was done fast which resulted in the loss of quality. I will not be back to this location.",2
"It is our first time to this location. 
Very nice. Food is good as well as service. Very decent.",4
Outstanding service - we initially requested the table by the fireplace but due to our party size they couldn’t accommodate us and didn’t tell us about that ahead of time. Also the table provided was in the dining area not by the bar as requested. However I spoke to a very nice manager and within a few mins he got us an amazing and private table in the bar area. Emma’s service and attitude were exceptional. The food was top notch as always. We will see you soon!,4
"I'm shocked I am giving the Keg a rating of 1, but for this visit it has to be done. The primary reason? We had a reservation in hand to visit this Keg and with a booth request. We got there and again asked about a booth, only to be told there are no booths available as they are busy. This was immediately followed by sitting a 'walk-in' at an available booth just feet from where we were sitting.

While that's a key issue, did find their steaks not as good as they used to be (pre-pandemic), less vegetables and smaller potatoes (ordered the twice baked potato). Maybe this is an issue across all Keg's, but seems like you are getting lower quality food now. Such a shame, as I had previously looked at The Keg as the ""Go-To"" for  good quality Steakhouse in Toronto.",0
"Excellent service, meal was great and staff very helpful",4
My first time at this location and while the ambiance was good my food was horrible. My server was great and accommodating. My friend and I ordered the garlic butter shrimp which was amazing! The mojito very good. My main course was the lobster and steak. The lobster was so overcooked I could taste the char. I ordered a medium rare steak and it was dry. It has the colouring of a medium rare it just tasted so unbelievably dry I don’t even understand how it was possible. I believe they have cheated out drastically on the cut of meat they serve. I definitely do not recommend.,2
Our go to neighborhood steakhouse.,4
Good time thank you to the server for engaging with our kid,3
"It was my Anniversary, and the Keg makes us surprised with a free Cheesecake😍 we love the Keg.",4
What a wonderful time! The food was super delicious and the service was absolutely wonderful!,4
"Had dinner with a friend, not only the server messed up our orders, but when we wanted to pay for our bill, we asked 4 employees to give us a bill, and they all insisted having the server to check out for us. We ended up waiting 15 minutes for our server to come and give us the bill, but he did not give us the machine, he took another 5 minutes to get the machine to us and left instantly right after. Terrible experience.",2
The server was friendly and professional.  Excellent customer.  I will definitely recommend all my friends and family to The Keg and Steakhouse and Bar North York restaurant.,4
"While not the best steaks I've had at the Keg, the food was good. The vegetables were the best thing on the plate. So good that I ordered more to go. The sangria was watery, however. I was disappointed. The service was excellent. Our server was friendly and attentive, he made the experience a good one.",3
"Our server, Aru, did his best to make our evening enjoyable, and it was. The celebration of two birthdays was graciously handled. 

Great food and great service.",3
"Amazing food and service, as always!  Great value, delicious steaks!",4
"The staff are welcoming and courteous 
Our server, Jasper, was outstanding. 
She made our evening extra special with her attentiveness. We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and especially the special dessert celebrating our 59th anniversary!",4
It was a lovely evening. The service was great. The food was delicious.,4
The service was excellent and our waiter was very patient with us. The food and drinks were excellent. I would highly recommend this location!,4
20th wedding anniversary,4
"It was my wives birthday, took her there for steak , we loved it , the staff were very friendly and they offered us a complimentary slice of our billy miner pie! Which was delicious",4
"The server was very nice, the atmosphere was amazing overall just great environment!",4
"Had a great experience start to finish! We enjoyed the ambiance, drink food and service.",4
Good food and service!!,3
Excellent steaks. We have eaten at a number of Kegs and this location ranks right up there.,4
Good experience with the cuisine and the ambience,4
"Service was great, really enjoyed the food.",3
Great food and service. Loved every minute and every bite!,4
"As usual the Steak was amazing great value (although more expensive than in the past)
Best one I've had there in the last 5-6 years. been a fan for 37 years
Tender Soft Juicy great cut bone in Rib Eye and cooked as ordered rare-med rare, chicago style. The chef nailed it!!!!!

In my top 2 steakhouses other is House Of Chan

i always recommend the KEG. good advetisinig",3
The seafood options were great and would be a great choice during Lent.,4
"I absolutely loved the peppercorn steak! The steak itself was cooked to my preference and the peppercorn crust was perfect. I'm glad I didn't have any of the bread offered, as the steak and its sides was just enough. The mushroom rice that came with my steak was rather plain tasting, but a perfect foil for the peppery steak. I also had the mini creme brule, which was just the right portion size after the main course. The staff were wonderful and I was especially impressed with the care and consideration that they showed to an older woman who had low vision. They were so helpful and considerate; the woman was very appreciative and I was very impressed. Kudos to the staff for making everyone who comes feel welcome.",3
"Great service. 
Otherwise very good. As expected.",3
"I was there for my birthday with a few girlfriends. I hadn’t been out to a restaurant for my birthday since 2020. It was a perfect night out. I loved this location, food and ambiance. Our server Shannon was excellent to attending to our needs. Great food & drink and great service. I’ll definitely be back!",4
"Amazing food, consistent every time you visit. Service is great. Highly recommend this Keg!",4
The server was very informative and friendly. Overall a great experience.,4
"Just WOW! Went to the Keg to celebrate a recent work promotion, and I was not disappointed. My partner and I go to the Keg often, but this was hands down the best experience we’ve had. The food was FANTASTIC, absolutely no complaints there. But what really made this experience even better was our waiter Gaurav. He was knowledgeable, available, and friendly.  Made our whole experience very special and memorable. 10/10 will go again.",4
"Peppercorn NY strip, twice baked potato. For an appetizer I had the mushrooms Neptune. Amazing.",4
"Nothing special about this place anymore, food has become average.",2
"There was a table of 6 really loud guys near us, so loud that we ate our dinner in silence because we couldn't hear each other.  V. uncomfortable, louder than you'd find in a sports bar.  Not sure what the restaurant could have done but when I looked around every other group was also not talking.  Service people were having to shout to be heard.  Somewhat ridiculous for fine dining.  Our evening out was ruined.  

Food was good, very standard Keg, no surprises.",2
"Service was great, our server was very nice and friendly. The garlic mashed potato didn't taste good and looked old.",2
"Front staff were great. Our waiter ""KEVIN"" was wonderful. Answered all questions, helped with food suggestions. Kevin really made our evening. Calamari: HUGE portion and done perfectly. Oysters Rockefeller: nice size oysters, very dry topping, not enough spinach\cream, too much bread crumb. Filet BlueCheese: this was my biggest disappointment. I had been looking forward to this dinner out for a few months. Not sure if the procedure has changed but the (again) dry, pretty tasteless ""topping"" that was to be the BlueCheese really was awful.  The steak was amazing, cooked perfectly. I ended up scraping off the topping and demolished the steal.  Vegetables were not nice !  Strange taste for the carrots and broccoli ? Maybe a seasoning ??  All in all the dinner was nice, just a few set backs.  I know this can happen from time to time so not overly concerned. Probably WILL NOT order the same dish - perhaps just the steak alone.  I can honestly say I have never had a bad steak at the Keg - no matter what location.  One additional item :  Not sure why there are tables for 2 ....  Once the bread plate, a couple of drinks are placed on the table, you guessed it, there is NO ROOM left for anything else. We were put in a table for 2 (between to tables for 4) and ended up requesting to be moved, which KEVIN was only to happy to assist us.  YOU HAVE A GREAT TEAM ON HAND - !!!!  Again, this is just my reflection on the meal we had, not everyone may agree with my notes.  I would suggest that you go and give it a try !",2
"Food was delicious and prepared as per instruction, server was polite and attentive,  overall...a fun and tasty meal.",4
"Everything was perfect, but there was one thing to be a little unsatisfied! it took a little long to have our food ready on the table. Apart from that, everything was great.",3
Very friendly and cozy,4
"Great food, great ambiance, great price, great service.",4
"Excellent waiter
Food hot and delicious
Presentation of food is attractive",4
"The keg is always amazing, the service at this location (and all locations) is amazing! Food was delicious",4
"Great restaurant, enjoyed the visit very much.",4
Attentive service. Steak grilled perfectly. Tasty desserts A great celebratory dinner.,4
Food was scrumptious. Staff was amazing. Happy to have us there.,4
Our server (from Napoli) was fantastic!  The 'manufactured' meal that we both requested exceeded our expectations - salmon on a farmers salad.  Thanks!,3
The Keg is always an amazing dining experience.  Menu has lots of selections and there are always specials. Great food. Never disappointed.,3
"Amazing service. Amazing food, amazing date.",4
Big table of 8 with three birthdays.  Great service and they didnt rush us.  Delicious steak as always.,4
Great location and ambience,4
"One of our favourite restaurants.  You know it's very well managed and run because the food and service are always good and they go out of their way to ensure customers have memorable experiences.
The only suggestion I have is perhaps not to dim the lights so much.  I know it's to creative that romantic ambience but it's really hard for older folks like us to read the menus lol!",4
"Everything was great..
My only complaint is that we arrived early and we would have preferred to sit in a better area of the restaurant. They put us on the very east side of the restaurant with all the young kids. And we were there as a couple.
Next time I would go to the lounge area & arrive later.
We asked to sit over there, but they didn’t want to put us there. They stated it was because their servers hadn’t arrived yet. We arrived at about 4:45.
I appreciate that our server Whitney was fantastic. She made it much more pleasant for us.",3
Nice restaurant and great food.,4
The keg was really good :) Sarah gave me and my friend excellent service! thanks Sarah!💗💗💗,4
Great experience very nice server,3
"The service, ambiance and the meal was good.  The shortfall is the lobster tail provided for both meals were extremely small.  Had to order a serving of shrimp to add to the meals.",3
"Absurd, I booked the table online for the location got the confirmation email it was for  Tuesday and guess what the location was closed. It just ruined my girlfriend's birthday",0
"Everything was fantastic, it was our first time to come to the Keg and to be honest was the best experience, beautiful restaurant and delicious food and nice service.",4
"had a good time, good food, good services, will come back as every year",4
"Ambience was less satisfying compared to other kegs that I went to. Food was good except for appetizer , when oyster Rockefeller came out there was no garnish, just 4 oyster with lemon. one or two cherry tomato would have made a difference.",3
"was assigned no server to our table, i had to go to ask for one after being left for 30 mins with no water offered at least.",1
Nice restaurant. Really enjoyed the steak it was nice and tender,4
Better than other Keg locations I’ve went to. Great service.,4
"As always great quality food, fun and friendly wait staff and hosts.
We love going to the keg",4
"Our server wasn’t super friendly, she wasn’t rude or anything but we could tell she wasn’t in a great mood.
The lobster tail was pretty good but my steak was dry and bit overcooked compared to our previous experience at other Keg location.",1
"The Keg did not disappoint! We ordered a filet mignon Keg classic meal and it was juicy and flavourful as we’d normally expect from the Keg. The restaurant was quite busy, but despite that our meal arrived on time, and we wrapped up our sitting in just over an hour. All in all, five stars!",4
Amazing and timely service - met all our needs and we had a terrific experience. Thank you KEG team for putting customers at the center of evrything,4
Always great at the keg. Prices has gone up because of inflation however compared to other places still great value for the times. Thanks again for the meal.,4
Our server was great! Food was so good as well.,4
"For the valentine’s date we were expecting a little bit more romantic atmosphere, our table was first next to the ordering desk I asked to be change to another table, our second table was next to the kitchen, I understand it was a busy night however My expectations were higher from Keg. Overall I always like keg.",4
Nice service.,4
"Excellent Food! 
Yummiest of Drinks, 
Topped off by Exceptionally Knowledgeable Staff
Definitely  come back again!

Thanks!",4
"Cozy place, good food overall experience was great.",4
"First of all, service was outstanding, both our server and the manager on the second floor but the food was average, we would like to consider ourselves a KEG regular, we mostly visit the downtown locations and it was our first time in at North York location.

Unfortunately, none of our steaks were cooked per our instructions, my husband had asked for medium well and got medium, I asked for medium and got rare. we already have complained about our shrimp cocktail so didn't wanna be a sore client but honestly, this branch's kitchen doesn't live up to the brand overall.",2
Amazing!  Miss the Keg so much! Well worth the wait! :),4
Everything was great except the temperature in the restaurant..we had cold air conditioning air flowing on top of heads ever 5 ministers or so..when I told the manager about it..he said that they will turn off the ac..which did not happen..it was -20 degrees outside tonight and I was freezing at the table..that was not pleasant,2
Fantastic service and great food as always. Highly recommend,4
"Food it’s cold my steak I ordered medium it was well done, lobster it’s so cold",1
"Of course during these latest Covid lockdowns in Ontario it is great to have the privilege to dine out.  I certainly haven't done so much lately.  It was such a great experience to dine out at this ""Keg"" location.  It had been two years since I last dined-out here.
The staff were all friendly and accommodating.  I know the restaurant was quieter than usual because it is still at only 50% capacity, but the food here is always delicious; cooked to perfection and is good value.  That's why this is such a popular chain.  
Look forward to returning soon.",4
Excellent food and outstanding service. Will definately visit in future!,4
"I go to the Keg for the prime rib but because of poor planning they ran out by 7:15. The excuse was because of takeout but it seems odd that they wouldn’t take takeout into consideration. Why even bother dining in if they are going to give preference to takeout customers? We ordered a 6 ounce glass of wine each but the waiter returned with a 6 and a 9 ounce. However, when we poured the wine into our glasses they were both 6 ounces. I would have complained but we didn’t see our waiter until the end of the meal and I couldn’t be bothered to pursue it. The steak was cooked to my specifications but the meat was tough and certainly wasn’t worth the cost 
It will be a long time before I return.",1
"Went for my sons birthday.  
After apps were cleaned and main course served no cutlery as provided, I had to wait and then ask while my food was getting cold.
Asked for ketchup on side for my kids when ordered food, server forgot and had to find him to ask while kids waited before they could eat.
Bought my sons slice of bday cake with the candle not lit, put dessert on the table , lit candle and walked away.  Shouldn't he have made it more a surprise and light the candle before he arrives? Very little effort from this server.

Really the server seemed not to care at all about being attentive and remembering what we ordered.  For a $200 meal with the service should have been MUCH better - My 16 yr old could do better!  I visit the Keg often, not sure how soon I'll be back, if at all.",2
Totally worth the price for the food. Will definitely be coming back!,4
"I ordered burger and was looking for their juicy gourmet burger. I was specific no lettuce. My burger came full with lettuce, fries with few fries in the side and the burger was their kids burger size. I called the waiter to clarify just in case there is a mistake and I got the kids meal. He was surprised and his answer was since he joined this is the burger size and as for the lettuce it’s his bad. 
Really the KEGG waiter answer is my bad. I’m sorry that this restaurant was my favourite till I had few mistakes with stakes that made me shift to burger and after this experience I don’t find a reason to go there anymore. The standard went down and I’m so disappointed",1
"The food was excellent, staffs are friendly and professional.  I personally like the second floor sitting.. less noises.",4
"It was a wonderful experience the location and interior is very beautiful. 

Had escargos and it was very delicious had mushroom on top of each escrgo and sauce had a hint of Curry. 

The teriyaki steak sirloin, with mixed greens. Very flavorful steak and very fresh salad. 

My friend had a caesar salad plus a side 6 oz sirloin steak it was perfect for her it was $13 extra for the steak which was well worth it.

Will definitely come again",4
Great staff … from the hosts to the serving staff !!!,4
Very reliable restaurant for consistently high quality food,3
"The atmosphere was relaxing, the staff was great, the Wait Staff, Kristen, was great.",4
"There was 4 of us. Appetizers and dinner was great.  One dinner was a steak. Very chewy. Our server asked if we wanted a new one. Did not. 
The real disappointment was the server with drinks. My guests came and waited 15 minutes for first drink. Rest of the evening was the same for our cocktails.  Otherwise all was good. Will not deter us from going back.",3
The keg is great for a dinner outing anytime of year. The food was a little overpriced but overall the quality was good.,4
Good as always,4
My steak was a tad fatty but was cooked very well. Service was on point and very quick. Would go back again,3
It was splendid. Nice waitresses and very nice ambiance. The starter bread is delicious,4
Keg is always great.,4
Food was excellent as always. Servers exceptional. Ambiance perfect to our liking. We could have a conversation without needing to shout. We will return there for all our special occasions and more.,3
"Maybe it was because of a big party of 8 but food was cold wasn't that good.
Service was excellent but food was disappointing.",4
We went to the Keg to celebrate my husbands birthday before the new covid closures take place and had a really lovely time. The server was wonderful and the food delicious and plentiful. Great way to celebrate a special occasion and we even got a huge piece of complimentary cake to celebrate the special day. We can’t wait until things reopen to return and enjoy another great meal!,4
"Great food, great service.",4
"The place was awesome, the food was nice as expected. will defiantly recommend it.",4
"Great Service and friendly staff, would recommend",4
"Had a great server, never can go wrong at the keg. Kids love it also. Hope to reopen soon, want to go back.",4
Great service with amazing food. Been here couple of times. I would still choose this one even if I have to drive 45mins to get here,4
"Outstanding hosting, beautiful table, very nice, very caring excellent hostess
Isabella Esposito!",4
"They couldn't get the cook of my steak right, first it was overcooked then undercooked, I was disappointed, I eat there often and was very disappointed this time.",2
Very good. The staff were very friendly,4
"Onion soup has a horrible smell with the combined cheeses. 

Not recommend. 

Recommend an original or classic recipe.",3
"Went for our New Years date back on Jan 1, 2022 and I can confidently say it was fantastic. The food was lovely, service impeccable, and the ambience was perfect. I got the salmon (lol yes take a pescatarian to a steakhouse), and it was incredible. We’ll be back!",4
Excellent food and appetizers...nachos and shrimp cocktail.  Delicious drinks too. Nice way to spend New Years eve.,4
"Great New Years Dinner.

Our server was lovely and we enjoyed our foods a lot. It was also happy hour so that is a bonus",4
"We have not been out to many restaurants since the pandemic. So our meal was a special treat for my husband‘s birthday. The restaurant was at half capacity and not very busy. However, we sat for 15 minutes before someone came to ask us if we want to drinks. By that time we’ve already decided on everything anyway. The drinks were brought out relatively quickly, but we were told there was a wait on our food because the kitchen was backed up. Again, the restaurant was operating at half capacity So it was unclear as to why everything would be backed up. It was a different keg location then we would normally go to, however, it is unlikely we will return to that location again.",3
Great for families,4
"Had a great birthday dinner out with friends last night! Wonderful in house dining experience! Friendly staff and service, delicious food cooked to perfection, nice presentation and good sized portions. The only con was the takeout meal we brought back home looked underwhelming and was not cooked to right temp (medium instead of medium rare). Different experience in comparison to our in house dining experience. Would dine in again, but not do take out.",4
Very accommodating staff and friendly service. Generously provided us with complimentary dessert to celebrate our special occasion. Thank you.,3
Really enjoyed our burgers; our server Gurav was friendly and efficient. This location seems to run out of different menu items.,3
Server was super friendly and attentive. Our meal was delicious.,4
"Thanks you for my server!
You are the best",4
Great service (Shannon the bartender? I think that was his name) and food was excellent as always.,4
Excellent as usual. Food was great & the server Michelle was very attentive.,4
"We have not been to The Keg for quite a long time and really enjoyed our experience.  We went for my wife's birthday and enjoyed every facet of our visit starting with amazing service, great food and an all around good time.  Will definitely try to come back soon.",4
"Attentive staff and a wonderful atmosphere. I felt taken care of, as I always do at The Keg. Liz was wonderful, making the whole experience seamless from start to finish.",4
"Unfortunately, we sat by the bar.  It was NOT the ambiance I wanted to celebrate my daughter's engagement.  I also had to mention to the server about it even though when we came in the greeter mentioned it to me; that we were here to celebrate an engagement.  The whole evening left me deflated to be honest.  I was expecting a little more attention.    
We have been at this location several times and unfortunately, this time - it did  not meet my expectations.",2
Excellent service and food.  Highly recommend anyone going there.,3
It was a very nice and clean experience and I would definitely recommend.,4
Wonderful!!,4
We were very comfortable with their Covid protocols and the staff were very friendly and polite.,4
"We had a wonderful time. We celebrated my mother’s 60th at the Keg. The service was impeccable. My two year old received some colouring items to keep her busy, warm milk and she seemed to enjoy the mashed potatoes which were delicious.  The waiter was very professional and helpful especially when it came to choosing my wine. My husband has a birthday coming soon so we’ll probably be going back there.
I would highly recommend. Tip: For those with children, just make sure that they are well behaved this is an adult atmosphere.  Overall it was a great experience.",4
"Excellent service and food.
I would highly
Recommend",4
"Everything was good as expected for the Keg as we go often.  But we were surprised that the food wasn’t as great as usual.  It was still good but there was too much black pepper and salt on all the steaks, the kids and my wife didn’t finish it.",2
"Excellent service 
Great food
Staff was amazing
Really enjoyed the evening",4
We felt as though the waiter was pressuring us into drinking. Also we asked for bread on the table and she never brought it. We reminded her and she still didn’t bring it. Then when we ordered dessert it took extra long and the waiter said sorry your order accidentally went to the wrong table so we had to wait even longer to get it. We felt very unwelcome. It was our first time at this location and my boyfriends first time overall going to the keg.,1
Had such a great time at keg with my friend after a while we caught up and the atmosphere at the restaurant is amazing can’t wait to be back there again,4
OK but nothing special.  Often feels a bit ore special -- maybe short staffed last night?,2
"Amazing service, food was delicious and beautiful environment.",4
We the most enjoyable evening. There to celebrate an 87th birthday. Our waitress was very friendly and efficient. Our meals were cooked to perfection.,4
"Good value and service. Despite vaccine checks, very efficiently carried out.",3
Great service and food! Definitely would go back for more!,4
It was an exceptional experience with great food and service. We will definitely be returning to dine again in the next few months,4
It was amazing! Food and service PERFECT,4
"Always a great experience!!!!  Good good, good atmosphere and great servers!!!",4
"Great service and ambiance, we can never go wrong by choosing the Keg.",4
Great night at there,4
"We have never had  bad experience
When dining at the Keg",4
"Medium rare steak cooks were oddly inconsistent. 
Kansas City bone in strip was average.",3
Fantastic restaurant. It would be much wonderful if the lunch hour could be regular.,4
"Great service, good food! Prime rib sandwich was ace. Their accessibility policy and attention to accommodation is one of the best I’ve seen.  
staff",3
Love this location. Great service. Food is always so good!,4
"Food was good and service was fantastic.  Ask for Roz at the North York location, she is very attentive and polite.",3
Waiter was polite and personable but not attentive. My filet muy on was undercooked and my husband’s rice was cold but waiter didn’t drop by to check on us until we were done with our meals. He also forgot about our special occasion and we had to remind him. We had to rush out early and requested the dessert to-go and had to wait for a while and remind the waiter who was busy interacting with other staff who had sat at the end of their shift for a meal. As a result we wouldn’t return to this location.,1
Absolutely wonderful all around experience.  My mother was with us and she has specific food allergies and the manager and server were highly attentive and responsive to the situation.  The service was outstanding.  Food was excellent; my husband and I requested dishes we have had in the past and we noticed a level of improvement in quality.,4
"Service professional, not hurried, staff extremely knowledgeable sand helpful and of course food and especially desserts were top notch.",4
"For my 1st time and anniversary and I have mentioned before this is special moment for us but they gave us an ordinary table in a noisy area… but honestly the food was fantastic, especially NewYork steak!",3
"The Keg gets an A for service. It was a little bit more packed than expected given COVID-19 measures. Nonetheless, it was a great dinner experience!",3
"When we asked the server for something we either didn’t get it or we had to ask a few times for the same item.   As simple as him asking if we wanted to try something, we said yes and it never appeared.  Water was empty and requested a refill a few times only to have to ask another time.",2
Outstanding service! We have dined at various locations but it’s one stands out as having superb service. Highly recommend,4
Amazing as always ❤️,4
The music was too loud  and not enjoyable. I could hardly hear my friend sitting across the table.,4
We celebrated our anniversary with our entire family at the Keg and it was a wonderful experience and everything went extremely well not to mention the food was delicious.,4
"Our experience was fantastic, particularly our server. We needed to be in and out somewhat quickly as we were going to a show, and she had us put in plenty of time. Ambiance and decor was great.",4
"the quality of the prime rib
at opening                              5 stars  
in 2020                                  4 stars
in 2021 August                      4 stars
in 2021 December                2 stars

the quality of short rib
October 2021                         1 star

Service was not available for a more reclusive table that i wished to take, ie #21.  That table remained unoccupied throughout the dinner.
I was given table #24, at high noise level.  Conversation was impossible throughout the whole dinner.  We gave up conversation for fear of having to shout.  It fared worse than a Chinese dim sum occasion.  But then the dim sum lunch would cost only 10% of the dinner price I paid at Keg.
It appears that the Keg has given up the original standard at opening.  I would still come for dinner, but will be for  occasions when I do not really care too much about.",2
"Such a wonderful visit to the Keg Lounge. Our sever Sarah was extremely accommodating and kind. It was our first time bringing our young baby out and she was so quick with our order, and really made us feel at home. Great job and many thanks to the Keg staff :)",4
"I found that the strip loin I had was not up to what I would expect from a steak house. It was quite chewy. My guest is not a meat eater and the salmon was not available, leaving him little choice. The young lady who served us was excellent.",3
"We waited a long time to order drinks
When waiting for drinks she brings Caesar salad instead of Caesar salad and still no water or bread

My steak was cold potatoe was wrong and cold butter and sour cream cold
Ordered double
Baked

Wanted dessert but took too long
And out of Salmon the one reason we come

Shame as is was our wedding anniversary",3
"The service was wonderful, but my steak was tough and they took care of the problem immediately!!! I will return soon....",4
This is the second time in as many trips that my steak was very gristly and sinewy.  Didn’t enjoy it at all.,3
"We denied during the busy late evening hour, where the entrance reception area was a free-for-all with absolutely no control. Understandably things move slower with extra checks in place, but there have to be controls to ensure people aren’t forced to be crammed together. Especially given that there’s no adherence to who arrived first in the reception area. So much tension for no reason. Also as a recommendation for those who aren’t contortionists or yoga instructors: stay away from the dining seats in the area adjacent to the bar. The body movements required to get comfortable and bring those “chairs” close enough to the table should earn you a spot on a reality dance tv show. Even then you end up being much lower than those sitting across you, which is quite uncomfortable. Service is also terribly slow, yet friendly.",1
"Out for Birthday dinner.  Food is always consistently
good at the Keg.  Great evening out.",4
"The server was very lovely. However, the resolution and approach, condescending behaviour by the manager when we tried to voiced our concerns about two failed attempts to rectify the issue was unacceptable.",0
Gracious staff and caring management.  Food is consistently good. Spacing of seating was excellent.,4
Generous prime rib portion for Classic meal. Calamari was fresh. French onion soup was hot and cheesy but not too salty. Pace of food serving was perfect. Great experience overall.,4
Everything was great!,4
I have a prosthetic needed a booth.  they acted like I was lying not impressed,3
"Excelent service and food. 
Table location was not the best but was the less of our worries. I would definitely go back !",4
"They've been over cooking the steaks recently, so it's been slightly disappointing despite the great from Shannon bartender/waiter.",3
"Just met with friends for drinks, good service, and had a nice time.",3
"Jon, our server was great. He checked on us regularly and went out of his way to make the experience great - it was my friend's birthday celebration and Jon made sure she felt very well taken care of!",3
It was a wonderful mean and a cozy atmosphere.,4
Kevin was a great host and suggested perfect wine with various food options,4
"The restaurant is amazing, my wife and I have a nice dinner there. The steak is very delicious. The desert can still be improved, may be due to our Asian taste. Overall, the unforgettable restaurant you will have.",4
Excellent food and great value as always.  Visit The Keg.,4
Excellent ! Superb !,4
It was for a birthday and we did receive the complimentary birthday cake but was hoping for a candle as well. All in all it was a great experience.,3
"The only reason for a 4 star instead of a 5 was the very beginning. We were waiting outside completely confused for the passport verification, there was no direction from the restaurant or any staff to help direct customers, otherwise everything else past that point was amazing",3
"This was my second time going to this location, it’s a great place with great service.",4
"We had a great time! Server was great, food was great and came out quickly, we will be going back!",4
Great food and service as always. I would come back again.,4
Keg is consistent and reliable. Always good service and good food. Fairly priced.,4
The venue is beautiful and nearby home.  Can`t miss.,4
"Our server was gracious and host Jack was a perfect young gentleman. 

Thanks to you both for adding to our enjoyment.",4
"First get together with friends since covid
Table for 6 was small.
Tiny lobster tails
Special advertised with garlic chips had 2
My medium rare was returned as it was incorrect order for another table 
Wamred butter was unlit...had to ask server
Coffee was cold! Had to ask for another 
Had to ask to separate bils and when they did...all bills were wrong
Disappointed with this location",0
It is a nice place with very friendly staff and good food.,4
"We have been to many Keg restaurants throughout Canada and the eating experiences have been consistent. This is restaurant visit to the Keg was different. I ordered the legendary Prime Rib dinner with loaded baked potato. The roast beef serving was warm and the side baked potato was ""stone"" cold. We arrived at the restaurant for the first sitting at 5 pm. I am not sure how something like that could happen at a Keg but it did. The server was very proficient and friendly. Great server. We will still patronize the Keg but it was a disappointment for me.",2
my steak was charcol ， they changed a new one for me,4
The food was so delicious and the waitress was so kind. She gave suggestions that made my dinner really tasty.,4
Great server,3
"The venue was rather loud, which made it hard to enjoy the meal.  Also, the tables were  a little too close together.",4
"Went for Happy Hour on date night. Elizabeth, our server, was outstanding. Really enjoyed the Baked Garlic Shrimp, and the bottle of wine was excellent value.",4
"great service and Food
5 Stars to the north york Keg Team",4
"Great atmosphere
But the food wasn't like what I expected",3
We have been there a few times and our family loves it. Have never had a negative experience. Great service as always .,4
"This is second time at this location.  First encounter was great so choose to try again.  The overall service was not what I am used to..steak either undercooked or overcooked…
Waitress really not attentive…aware there is lack of help but there seemed to be a lot.",1
Love coming to this Keg. Always great service. Friendly and attentive. The food was amazing too!,4
"Best dining experience, the staff were kind and so helpful. Made my birthday the best one. 10/10 would definitely visit again",4
"Great meal, as always. Most importantly an amazing and attentive server. Nothing but a positive experience.",4
"Our waiter, Armando, was top-notch.  Great service from him.",4
Value for money.  Tasty steak.  Booth where we could hear each other speak - that's a bonus as many restaurants are just too noisy.,3
"Busy night, staff were friendly and accommodating- food was wonderful and quick to the table. A fun, upbeat place for dining, drinking, sports on at the bar - well done!",3
We had a lovely waitress.,4
"The Keg on Friday night was quite noisy. Where we were sitting I could hear the music loud enough to know it was annoying, but could not make out what was playing.
The service was excellent, but my husband's Teriyaki Sirloin, which was ordered medium well, arrived quite well done and the meat was grisly. At the end of the meal we mentioned that fact to the server, who generously comped our glass of wine as compensation.",3
"It was the first time out to The Keg in almost 2 years, due to Covid.
My Aunt has mobility issues and there was no problem accommodating her wishes for seating.
I have severe allergies to nuts and once again the server was very good with ensuring my food was safe to eat.
The server was very nice. very professional and made us feel special.
We really enjoyed our meal and our visit.",4
"Everything was good, service and food were good. Only negative comment was that it was very noisy. Unusual because we have never noticed a noise issue before when eating there. May just have been a random group of patrons that we were sitting near.",3
"This place was amazing. Super friendly staff. Everything felt just really nice. Well done, and thank you for a wonderful evening",4
"excellent evening, food was great, service was amazing and not too noisy",4
"We came for the early night happy hour, stayed for main dinner, then continued for the late night happy hour!!

Waitress name was Franny. (Francine)",4
"The food was tasty, however the steak for both me and my partner was cool, and not enough salt as usual.

Our server Cam, was a amazing and offered us a free dessert.",3
Very nice overalls,4
We always have a consistently good time at the keg. Food is great and the service is fabulous. Keep up the great work!,4
"Best ever place, all staffs are very friendly and amazing service!",4
Our server was amazing!,3
We enjoyed a very delicious meal. The ambiance was quiet yet still busy. The service was perfect. And we felt safe was they were taking steps to make sure we felt this way. Many birthday celebrations around us. Nothing but positive things to say.,4
"Service was fantastic
Eden Served us and was kind, and efficient",4
"The food was great, atmosphere was relaxing, however the lighting was fairly poor which put strain on the eyes, plus a family with kids was nearby where they were screaming from time to time making the dinner experience not as great.",3
The service was professional and food was delicious! Beautiful restaurant,4
"Great service, great food, quick",4
"Great food, great service. Very consistent- you know what you are gonna get and it’s consistently cooked well. Appreciated the $5 parking.",4
Great family day net with the kids and grandparents. The server Armando was outstanding! So nice to have some relax time here after 18 months of pandemic!,4
"We have been to The Keg many times and enjoy it a lot. Yesterday we went to celebrate a personal accomplishment and the food was terrible (salty, burnt, etc). We went home very disappointed.",1
It was good. My daughter was offered their famous ice cream cake with a candle. It was appreciated and the cake great.,3
"Food is always good, but the steaks were definitely overcooked.  We asked for medium-rare and got well-done.  We didn't send it back because it still tasted good, but would have tasted better medium-rare and also because we were starving.",3
Service was slow and the servers seemed tired,3
"Excellent service, great food, and it felt like a safe environment for the COVID-wary.",4
"Great service.  Food came too fast that we weren't finish with our appetizer and our main came already arrived at our table.
This Keg at North York has professional services which we were surprised at especially when the server was fairly new in her job.
Management has done well.  
Their food or menu hasn't changed which is a good thing.",3
"Great branch 
I highly recommended better than many other locations",4
"Reserved a table for 4 a week in advance, got seated by a door that led to the porch. Very cold, very noise, felt like we were part of the crew with the amount of servers coming in and going through our table. One of my guests Ordered steak and lobster- butter for lobster was not served. Service wasn’t too bad but evening did not feel worth the buck….",0
We had a great time at this Keg. The staff was outstanding,3
"Awesome service, great food!",4
"Great service, nice to be back! I have missed the food and the atmosphere. The bar is a great place for drinks and apps. I’d say only thing missing was the people sitting at the bar.",4
"Nice ambiance ,
Love Prime Rib and Billy Miner Pie",4
It was an okay experience. The food was good. We had a mix up with some of our orders but the manager was quick and kind enough to fix and makeup for it. Overall it was a good experience with good food.,3
"I met with two slightly handicapped friends.  Downstairs there was a high top table.  Up stairs there was a door to the outside that made it drafty.  The staff were very kind and accommodating.  The food was very good and we had a nice evening.  I didn't like parking underground at night.  Next time I'll look for parking on the street.  We usually go to your Yonge Eglinton location, but it's difficult to get to right now for handicapped people.  We enjoy the Keg and can always count on a nice dinner there.",2
"noisy. order took one hour to arrive and was blah.
dessert was prompt and good though",2
"Great service and great food. I was very impressed by the quality of the meat. 

Also the server was friendly and helpful.",4
"Great service, food was excellent!!
Only suggestion would be that it was very cool when the side door was opened and left open on occasion for a short period of time to access the patio.",4
"While I asked ahead for a booth, we were put in a very small two top where I was worried our appetizers would not all fit. Aside from that, our server seemed genuinely pleased to see us and was attentive until the end. The food and plates came out hot and the quality is ever the same: excellent.",4
"Professional staff, nice and cozy environment, good food. Best for special occasions.",3
Much better then the old location was,4
"Great service! Recommended!!!
………………………………..
XxxxxxxxxxxxxxxX",4
"Great steaks and roast beef as usual, also the best Caesar Salad. A little noisier than usual as we were in the bar area.   Regrettably they have dropped the Alaska King Crab from the menu, something I have enjoyed over the years. 
Outstanding service.",3
"I love the Keg.
The only issue I had this visit is the section we were seated in, the chairs are extremely low. Impossible to eat comfortably for 90% of the population. 
Great experience as always.",4
"We ate on the Patio and were very pleased. The food was fresh and very tasty. The service was amazing and very quick.

The Patio is lovely with heaters, a roof, and wind protection.

All in all, the evening was exactly what we had hoped. Will definitely go there again.",3
"The Keg is The Keg. 
Keep it up.",4
"The Keg always delivers in terms of flavour and food, but it's the 'gift card king' for a reason: expect inflated prices as a result. Is it a great night out? Yes. It is overpriced? Also yes.",3
"Poor quality food really disappointed.  Thing have changed here, we were regulars before Covid but won’t be anymore.  Too bad!!",0
"We had our anniversary dinner and ordered the calamari, 10 oz prime rib and 10 oz filet mignon. Calamari was good. The prime rib was less tender as expected, and the filet mignon was good. Mushroom rice was a bit salty, so as the fried potatoes. Services from our waitress was excellent. We got a piece of almond ice cream cake for the special occasion. That was real sweet.",3
Service was amazing and the food as always great!,4
this is a nice space with good service and good food. weekdays are nice because it’s not super busy.,4
"After more than 30 years, still a great place for dinner!",3
Great food and service,4
"As always the food, service, table near the fireplace were all very good. We enjoyed a delicious dinner, easy to carry on a conversation with an attentive server nearby. We will be back again!",3
Waitres was excellent. Need her # short philipina. Thanks.,4
Great keg experience as always,4
After 18 months of suffering through miserable CERB tainted service it was so refreshing to get professional service again. Cant beat the Keg for consistency.,3
"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary dinner at the Keg. We both had the ""Steak Oscar"" which was a steak annd seafood combo and it was excellent. I recommend ordering the steak ""blue""- it was delicious and very tender. The seafood was  a bonus delight. We appreciated the dessert as an anniversary gift. Our waitress was friendly, charming, cheerful and efficient.",4
The food was fantastic and very friendly service.,4
Amazing service and very tasty food.,4
"Very accommodating, great food, great service. Thank you",4
Great experience. Food was delicious… service was caring. And the bread - yummm,4
"My go to is the Rib steak, Medium cooked at this location. 
Date had New York Strip and was a still pink when asked for Medium cooked.",3
"Ambiance was fine. For food, I ordered Baked Brie, Deep fried cauliflower (not good, sauce was very odd tasting) , Caesar salad (way too much dressing) 8ozsteak + lobster, and 6oz top sirloin. 

Our apps arrived first but server didn’t check on us — had to flag another server down to ask for aolio for cauliflower as it’s dipping sauce was too salty. 

Mains came later, my friends 8oz steak was cooked to MY done-ness, and my 6oz steak was cooked to HIS done-ness.. my server had casually been walking by when I mentioned this to him.. he said we could swap our steaks or he could send it back.. tbh, I was a bit uncomfortable having to choose between the two when I personally feel like he shouldn’t taken it right back to the kitchen— but being polite I swapped it with my friends even though steak sizers were different.  Our server never came back to check on us until our mains were done and it was time for the (surprise birthday cake) and bill. 

To sum it up, the birthday dinner was lackluster. We still tipped generously but I doubt I’ll come back to this location.",1
"The Keg is always a classic, can’t go wrong.

Our server was such a sweetheart and a lovely woman.",3
Our service was excellent! Our server was outstanding. We will return to this location.,4
"I don’t know what has changed, but the food was not what it used to be. Server was not attentive and didn’t get the memo on customer service.",1
"Thoroughly enjoyed our night out with Kam's superb table sevice backed by an incredible team that prepared our steaks, ribs and salmon to perfection. The entrees all arrived to our table simultaneously. Adding the unforgetable variety of delicious side vegetables, defined the most memorable meal. We'll definately be back!",3
Great food and service!,4
Staff did a tremendous job. Love the new location!,4
"The steak was cooked perfectly, tender and delicious. Excellent meal and beautiful setting. Very enjoyable way to treat myself! Would definitely do so again!",4
Our server Roz was very attentive amd efficient. She was great. Food was great as well,4
Very good experience. The dessert ( Billy Miner Pie) was on the house as we went on occasion of birthday!!,3
Very accommodating to my allergies and excellent service from Amir and Shannon,3
Food is great as always and got a great wine pairing suggestions for the teriyaki sirloin,4
Food was cooked to perfection. Probably the best i've had at the keg.,4
"Was able to get a patio seat as requested; service was good; food was great, same with drinks.",4
Just a wonderful experience. It was perfect and we had a great time,4
"The food was amazing, love every meal we ordered. The waitresses (Kristine) was super nice.",4
Great service.  Great attention to all safety protocols. Wonderful food and evening,4
Did not celebrate birthday even though mentioned on the reservation and discussed with staff.,3
"The food is amazing. 
The service is one of a kind",4
"I have been to the Keg on many occasions and had any different items on the menu.
On this occasion my companion had the filet which was excellent and we shared the Billie Miner Pie which was good as usual. I ordered the special (Braised Short Rib) which was too well done.
The service was excellent as usual.",2
Staff was very helpful in accommodating our food allergies and reassuring we had a good time.  Our dinner was excellent!  Thank you all.,4
"Our go to restaurant for an evening out. The New York Strip steak (Double Chicago Medium Rare) never fails to disappoint. The service is always friendly, prompt, and professional. Wine and liquor pours are substantial,  and the prices are more than fair.",4
It’s so gooddddddd,4
Great anniversary date with hubby,4
"The Keg never disappoints, our server was really professional.",4
"It was great! Our server Gafor  was so kind and very prompt. He informed us of the special drink special that night. 

My only issue was that it was COLD lol. The A/C was blasting. 

Nonetheless I’d definitely return to the keg.",4
"Thank you The keg for an amazing experience, our anniversary was a success and our server delivered everything we need, always checked on us and kept us welcome the whole time.",4
"Checking Vaccine Certificates were a little disorganized but once inside everything
was very good.",3
Incredible food and service. Steaks cooked to perfection. The whole experience was superb. Would recommend and return to this location.,4
We had the best experience!!! Food and service was wonderful. I will be definitely coming back!,4
Good food as usual but few flaws in the order we made but I am glad they acknowledged it.,3
"Everything was on point.  First time at this location.....
We'll be back 👍🏽",4
"Own server Shawn was so great to deal with! Funny, easy going and attentive.",4
"We love The Keg. Never disappointed. The service, the quality and the ambiance.",4
"Good food, good meat, good service. We enjoyed our time at the keg.",3
"Food was good and fresh , environment was elegant service was good price was reasonable I recommend at least try once I am sure you enjoy .",3
"I was celebrating my 35 bday with my parents. 
Everything was great as always!!!",4
Online booking is  super easy and they sent me reminders. Food was excellent. Superb drinks options. Been a loyal customer for 7 years. They never failed to satisfy us. They also gave us free desert for our anniversary ( which was delicious) !  Will definitely visit many more time.,4
Rainy evening and trying to navigate new covud rules. Food was really good and I'm definitely coming again. Patio with heaters is cool,3
Food was cold. Waitress literally disappeared for an hour.,1
"Great food, good service, and a quiet environment, I was able to have an enjoyable virtual dinner with friends in another country.",4
"I requested Patio when I made a reservation through OpenTable but they said Patio only available by calling them directly, not by OpenTable.
Also, I mentioned no peanut for one meal but they bring birthday cake with tons of nuts! 
I’ll go back there but not going to make any reservations through OpenTable to get Patio and to make sure No peanut.
None of my requests passed to them.",1
Staff at the door were able to accommodate the reservation on time.  The wait staff was friendly and helpful.  Food is always good.,3
"The steak taste has changed. we ordered classic steak menu, the meat marinated very less but the veggies (mushrooms) was a bit salty. That brought the mushroom taste stronger and killed the steak taste. however, the salad with blue cheese was excellent and still great. The server was kind and nice as well.
One thing I was waiting outside, the waiting line helper never smiled and seemed stressful. 
Before, if it was birthday celebration event, this restaurant used to provide free ice cream cake, but this time was nothing. ( I know that the restaurant doesn't need to provide, but still I expected to receive the cake from the previous experience and a bit disappointed).
However, overall, I feel still this is one of my favourite since I had lots of great experience before.",2
"Great ambience, we had a newer server who did a good job. We did have a few issues, service was slow to clean up our food, one of appetizers never showed up until we asked about it (they were very nice and took it off our bill) and our steaks were under done (we had asked for medium rare and it came more rare than I’d prefer). Overall a good experience but not typical of The Keg as usually service is outstanding.",2
Slow service.  No waitress for 10+ mins. Bartender came to take our drink order in the interim,2
Service was great along with the regular performance for food,3
Always a great experience at Keg!,4
"This was on a Monday night. So a slow night.
The food was good. the wait staff  were excellent and very attentive. I know that other reviews were hit and miss with the quality of the food. Chefs must have been having a good night.",3
Great location and great staff.,4
Food quality is not good any more,1
"I asked for Medium Rare steak Teriyaki Sirlion and I got over cooked and burnt steak.

For the amount of money I paid, I was expecting to get the top notch steak at KEG like I had before.",1
Date night,3
A very warm and cozy atmosphere to dine in. Restaurant has taken additional social distancing measures inside for the protection of the guests. Food items are always served with a high standard of excellence and tastes delicious. Definitely a great place to spend with friends and family during the weekend.,3
Our server Grant was not very friendly. It was my husband's birthday and he charged us for the slice of pie that is usually free for a celebration. Did not enjoy his service at all. Also the rice was very hard and tasteless,2
Our birthday experience was excellent.  Greeting was as it should be in this pandemic environment.  The service provided by MacKenzie was excellent and the food was delicious as we expected it to be.,4
"Perfect service, delicious food. Enjoyed our family night.",4
"Food is very highly salted and so very good, but prepare to be seriously bloated the next day.  Service is really good, prompt, polite, thorough.  Portions of meat are huge but everything was delicous.  House wine is good!",3
"It was my dad’s birthday and the server made it super special for him, thank you! :)",4
not bad but not at same level I remembered from another Keg. Nice place and super nice personnel,4
very nice place. Amazing food and a great service!,4
"Calamari starter is always reliably good despite what must be frozen calamari.  As were the Caesar Salads.  My wife wash v happy with pistachio encrusted salmon, I was less so with the two Lobster Tails.  They were cold and slightly overcooked.  Not rubbery but no longer delicate.  Also unseasoned so that they were bland and truly without taste.  The plating was attractive.  We took home an order of prime rib which our son wolfed down in obvious appreciation.",3
The keg is always a great option for everyday dining but a little overpriced,3
Great service and food was good.,3
Really good service and food.  Love my steak.  It would be good to have picture on the menu for each dish.,4
"We have always gone to this location prior to seeing a movie at Empress Walk.  We sit in the bar area and the Service has always been great.  Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. The food doesn’t take too long and alway the right temperature. 

I highly recommend this location of the Keg.",4
"Our server Dave was outstanding, and very accommodating and pleasant to deal with. The food was very good too. Dave was able to move us to in an inside table so we could have more time which was much appreciated. Only drawback was it was very cold inside. Other than that it was a great dinner and night with my friends! :)",3
Loved everything!,4
Our server Kristin C made our anniversary celebration a memorable evening.  Thank you Kristin.  And the food was delicious.,4
"We were put in a back corner beside the kitchen and it was so so quiet. One of the reasons of going out is seeing people and the ambiance.  It felt dead. I noticed some people seated near windows where it was more lively, we were not given an option. The food was average. I had the roasted chicken, it was small and nothing exciting. My husband had the 20oz rib steak with rice, he ate half of the steak (we took the leftover home to the dogs) and he wouldn't touch the rice, it was super dry.
The only good thing about this place was the waitress, her name i believe is Sophia.
Not coming back.",2
"Restaurant offered great customer service, my steak was not OK and the manager quickly fixed it, really good service.",3
"Have been a customer for years but this was unacceptable and horrible experience (2nd time in a row). Poor staff-training, poor- service of food in a timely manner, poor comprehension regarding serious allergies  serious lack of communication from waitstaff through to kitchen, floor-walker/manger until general-manager came over.
Apologies given, credit given but serious lack of system control when allergies are identified at time of reservation.",0
"Steaks cooked perfectly, escargot appetizer really yummy, service always very attentive.",4
We went to this location but our steak wasn’t so good. We enjoyed the mushroom Neptune and nice atmosphere. The shrimp cocktail was nice and fresh.,2
"No patio seating offered after we specifically asked for it and kept looking out on the patio to see empty tables. 
Manager seemed disinterested in accommodating us
Too many children running around shouting at 10pm!",2
"This was my first time at the location. The Manager was super nice, waiter was amazing, the energy of all staff was A1 & the vibe was perfect. Highly recommend going here & I plan to go again.",4
Yummy food! Our server Shawn was awesome and made the experience that much nicer.,3
"Great service and food, all served in a timely manner. Would highly recommend this location!!!",4
My husband and I had date night on the patio. It’s a really wonderful patio and what impressed us most was our server Jasper. She was smart and professional and was able to make adjustments when things didn’t turn out. We will definitely go back and hope to have Jasper as our server.,3
"Food and service were fantastic, great drink menu and the birthday dessert was a nice touch! Will definitely be returning.",4
"Armando was the nicest server ever! He came out with our food quickly and always had a smile on his face and a great attitude.  I've been to the keg multiple times but this time was especially pleasant thanks to our server Armando. 
Keep up the good work thank you so much!!!!",4
"Went with my wife to celebrate my birthday.  Ordered a New York Sirloin medium rare that came medium.  I’m not that picky so ate it anyway and it was very good.  Sent back my glass of wine because of a dirty glass.  The manager replaced it and in the end they didn’t charge me for the wine and also gave me a free birthday dessert.  Very satisfied overall.  Food is always excellent at the keg.  It was my first time to this location and I noticed that all the staff seemed quite young and maybe a little less experienced compared to my last visit at the Toronto airport Keg.  They did well all things considered while having to juggle covid rules also.  

I definitely look forward to my next visit.",3
The service was excellent. Very impressed. I will return.,3
"Waitress did not give good service, she was distracted when taking our order kept looking in the mirror, and around the room…. Forgot to give us water when we were seated and forgot I have ordered a Coca Cola, had to ask a waiter to find our waitress, after 10min she came and I asked for the Coca Cola again and she said… “ oh no one came yet” 

Food was excellent but service was terrible.",1
"Great food and although steak was slightly over, but still taste great!
Food was a bit slow, but that’s because they were doing a fresh batch of baked potatoe.",3
"Great environment, servers are very attentive, highly recommend this Keg",4
"Wonderful Lobster Feast plus desert the Billy Miner Pie, great service 
Thanks 
Mark Warsh",4
Great customer service!  Great food and the employees always make you feel welcome.,4
"Excellent!
Servers were attentive to our needs
Great conversation yet respected our privacy
Checked in on a reasonable level
Plates were cleared when meals were ended.
Very Happy from arrival to departure.
Thank You!

Kim",4
Great service and food as always. Despite it being “busy” when seated you could not tell that there were many people in the restaurant,4
"It was great.  Our server OD was outstanding.  The only complaint I have is about the flies.  So many of them.  Some were on my glass, and others were either flying around or were on the mirror.  That I did not like at all. You had to keep shewing them away with your hands to protect your food and drinks.",3
"Everything was great, I really enjoyed my time from front door to the coffee service",4
"Great people and service, nice vibed location (decoration, lights and everything). Food not so much, tastes bland in general except that the mixed vegetables gnocchi is pretty good. Portion is great though.",3
Table at entrance to patio should be used only as a last resort. Too many staffers marching by with plates.,3
All was good food and service excellent,3
"Great staff, great food, great service and takes reservations",4
Orestes was a very helpful and attentive server. Well done !,4
It was another great experience. Was at the keg North york 1 yr. Ago and had the same waitress and she remebered us. That is an amazing asset to have.,4
Anniversary,4
"The evening was a total success. The service provided by our server could not have been better. He was outstanding.
The food was great and was very tasty and enjoyable.
Thank you for a great evening.",4
The food was delicious and the staff was incredible. Our waitress was very friendly and made our dining experience 10 times better.,4
Great night as always.  Nice and consistent service.  Service was outstanding.,4
Very accommodating and great service and Elysse said,4
"The food was up to high Keg standards. The service was awful; my order was taken by one individual who kept interrupting me wile I was making my choices, it was obvious that he did not listen to me properly because what was eventually brought was wrong, every encounter with waitstaff at my table was different and I was not given the opportunity to complete my order. When brought to her attention, the supervisor did her best by apologizing profusely and adjusting the bill accordingly.",2
"Service is great. Never had bad service at the Keg.
Food is always amazing also.",4
"90 minute time limit. You will feel the pressure to eat and finish from all staff. Food was prepared well, but not as good as other Keg locations. Service was excellent, wait staff checked on us constantly (partially to speed us up). Not as relaxing as I'd hoped. Prices are inflated due to pandemic. Value isn't as good.",2
Always. Amazing,4
Our servir Amir was outstanding. Food was great.  Only suggestion we could give is the table to lounge chair height unacceptable and uncomfortable...table was to high for chair and vice versa,3
"Our server was so sweet, attentive and kind. She made the whole experience lovely.",4
"I didn't have any food, hence, the low rating for food since it required a response.",4
"Always a fun time with great food, excellent service, and good value!",4
"And yet again, The Keg on Yonge demonstrated why it's our go to restaurant for an evening out. Steaks were done ""Double Chicago, medium rare"", just as we asked, and the service was at it's usual friendly, yet professional level. All in all, another great evening.",4
"The service was exceptional. Our server was superlative, the food well done, and the entire experience was most enjoyable",4
"Went here to celebrate my fiancé’s birthday. Service was fabulous, food was absolutely delicious. Would absolutely go back!",4
Food was excellent . Nice touch to give us piece of cake to celebrate anniversary . Felt very comfortable with the social distancing and covid safeguards,3
"Excellent dining experience.   All of the food orders were prepared exactly as requested.   Our server (Thalia) was super friendly and extremely attentive.  Try to guess her background, my girlfriend and I couldn't figure it out so we just asked her.",4
"Hello, we have been very satisfied of Kam, our knowledgeable and professional waiter last night. We are so glad to be back to the Keg. The food, service and atmosphere are at the same high level as we remember them from before Covid-19. Thank you, we will visit you again soon. Regards,",3
As usual the food was very good however…The service was outstanding our server was spot on and she made for a lovely dinner! Thanks again.,4
Food was good but the service was excellent. Lovely young man was very helpful,4
Food was great.  Drinks could have been better.  They tasted watered down.,3
our food was very good but felt that it was a little overpriced.  our server was very sweet and efficient.  extremely accommodating,3
"I initially booked for my parent's anniversary and even put a note down about the special occassion. Nobody greeted them for their speical day nor were they given a complimentary cake to celebrate. Although our plates were hot, the food itself )main courses) came out warm-ish... More on the cooler side. I didn't have the energy to complain at this point since I was already disappointed and upset about the anniversary note being ignored/forgotten about even though I called 2 hours before to double check with the hosts. I also requested for dining on the second floor and did not get that either. Total waste of money. I would've rather taken all the money I spent it somewhere cheaper. Very disappointing experience.",0
Our waitress did not check on us. Had to flag other random servers down to get salt and pepper. Did not receive a refill of our drinks the entire time. My steak was also Luke warm.,1
"We've been going to the Keg for years and it really didn't matter what location you were at; you always knew exactly what you were going to get, it was the same. This is the first time we've been to the Keg since the pandemic started and it was a great disappointment. The steak was dry, the frizzled onions were something completely different than we've ever had before, and the service took forever (about 45m between ordering and being served).",1
"First our server put the knife on the table. We didn't like that , because of Covid, so we asked him to put it on a plate. 
Then we had a little bug in our Caesar salad. They changed the salad , dropped price for one calamari, but totally unacceptable. 
we never go there again. really poor service. We were also all time hearing servers laughing at the back. 
Seats were comfortable, social distancing was messing, but finding a live bug in our salad totally unacceptable.",2
Had an amazing time. Service was awesome.  Will definitely go back again and again.,4
"I was very happy that I was able to make a reservation, they were ready for us, food was excellent. Our server did an excellent job.",4
"The dinner experience was very good, the service excellent. From my viewpoint only (as I was with 5 other people), the off points were: the margarita was too sour and tasted like it was possibly from a mix; the steak was cooked as requested but still a little on the tougher side. Not what I was expecting from previous Keg experiences.",3
Birthday party,4
We had a pleasant evening and an excellent meal. We would have preferred not to be seated in the bar.,3
"Free Billy Miner Pie for our birthday celebration! Thank you, Keg North York staff!",4
"Thank you so much KEG, we had great night there , we celebrated my sister’s birth day and it was fantastic. 
The only problem is that we ordered 3 stakes with different side dishes and different cook styles but the mid cook one was in the wrong plate. 
But out of this everything was amazing.",4
"good service, food was done excellently. 50characters. 50characters.",4
"Everything was good but the steak. Given that this is a steakhouse, that might be something they work on fixing. We had two steaks and they were too thick and tough at medium rare. Too much salt on the frites and the meat. Rookie mistakes for a restaurant.",3
Love the lobster season,4
It was by far the best restaurant I have been too loved it and I’m totally gonna come back:),4
"Great food, great service, one of the best creme brulee in the city.",4
Steak wasn’t cooked the way I asked and when sent back the outside was cooked but inside was still rare. Very disappointed,1
"Food was delicious and waitress was great, friendly, prompt and made you feel comfortable",4
Had a 1 year anniversary and everything was perfect.,4
"Wonderful atmosphere and an excellent prime rib, my waiter Brandon was wonderful!!",4
"Victoria was great! Always very nice and fast, over great meal!!",4
Food quality and service are good as always and with lots of social distancing and safety protocols which would definitely make you feel safe,4
"We went for an early dinner on a Friday night. Our server was wonderful. My friend and I shared an app and a steak dinner. Our meal was nicely separated on to two plates. I like my steak cooked more than my friends and so they brought it out for me to see how it was and they were happy to cook mine more. We were asked when we arrive if we were celebrating anything and because we were we got a free desert, and boy was it big.",4
"First time on the 2nd floor patio and impressed by how spacious it was particularly now with COVID and safety protocols.

The meal choices were overall excellent but 2 of the steaks (top sirloin & New York cuts) were unfortunately slightly overdone.",4
Always a delicious and dependable meal and experience!,4
42nd wedding anniversary,4
Great service as always at this location..,4
Wonderful evening! Food was delicious and the staff were extremely friendly. Our waitress Natasha was amazing with great recommendations! Highly recommend! :),4
"Our servers name was Shawn V. and he was beyond amazing! Was very attentive and made our experience that much more enjoyable. The food was delicious, lobster fest is definitely a must when it's on",4
Excellent food and great service made for a wonderful date with my love.,3
"Great service, friendly, accommodating, great food.",4
Good customer service. Very accommodating.. foods are awesome! And place is cozy and clean,4
"We booked 2 weeks ago when there was only patio option available, when we got there , they didnt give us patio
But we had good time and  all staffs were very nice , specially manager And Zofeeya
We always have the best experience even we didnt get the spot we wanted",4
Great as always,4
"Having been to this location of The Keg many times, we were dismayed to be shown to a less than desirable table. Nonetheless, we didn't say anything about that. Our server was obviously very new, and didn't know much about the various menu items. On top of that, she advised us that we would have to vacate our table sooner than expected, because another party was coming in. That did it! We called over the manager, who rectified the problem. All in all, not our usual Keg experience.",3
Great to get out and eat in an establishment.,3
Service was above and beyond.,4
Everything was great - we were happy & enjoyed our night out,4
Was great. Service was fast and efficient and food was great quality as usual.,4
"The service was great, the food was good, unfortunately they didn't have my fav escargot but the wings, tuna tartar, and cauliflower mash were delicious. The noise was low and got moderate towards the end of the evening. The barroom 1st floor tall tables weren't most comfortable for a short girl, the stools are quite tall, I've been before in the lounge area which was much nicer but was reserved for a birthday this night. Have not been on the patio upstairs but seems nice. The bathrooms are only on the second level, there is an elevator though. Overall it was good.",4
Great Experience,4
Steak was way under cooked. All they did was reheat it and not  even change the plate. Still bloody and just disgusting. Manager came over and didn't even say sorry. All he said was heard your steak was undercooked and a new one was coming out. Which it wasn't even new just reheated and was still looking undercooked but didn't want to complain further. Very very very disappointed,0
It was awesome. Server was great,4
"great service, great staff and the food was really good as well. Love this place",4
Went with Dad. Get place and friendly help staff!,4
"Had a great night!!!! Ambience was good. Had an amazing server. Her name is Joyce, and she truly gave amazing recommendations to us. :)",4
It was a good experience,4
"Always a great dining experience!!!  Service was awesome as always and the food, fantastic!!!!!  So glad to be able to eat indoors again.  Happy to see people working and things betting back to “normal”.   Looking forward to going back soon!!",4
Great location with patio. Good place for a celebration or date.,4
"The Keg never disappoints but this location felt next level. The patio is gorgeous and the food was so good we cleaned our plates. The peach bruschetta was delicious, the salads fresh and the main course piping hot and cooked perfectly. It's not very often I can eat a 20oz steak but I sure did that night!",4
Our server was super nice and the food was amazing!,4
"Nicely spaced out for social distancing and relaxing atmosphere, great for families.  Quick efficient service. Permanent patio structure no worries about rain",4
Beautiful patio. Great service! Delicious meal.,4
"Good to be back in Keg. 
The steak is always perfect; the service was excellent, just slightly slower.
The upper patio is ok, although I prefer sitting inside in this restaurant.
Wishing you a healthy and beautiful summer. :)",4
Pleasant and relaxing in early evening rain under covered rooftop patio. Memorable 53 Anniversary. Waiter Abe was very polite and extremely efficient with his assistant.,4
Staff were exceptional food was great. Everything was perfect! Our waiter was so sweet it was a young Italian lady,4
"The ribsteak was fantastic, and the portion is huge.",4
"I was very disappointed due to our steak dinners being cooked not as ordered. My family and I like going to The Keg to celebrate our family occasions. It was my birthday when my daughter asked where would I like to go for my birthday dinner without hesitation I  immediately suggested The Keg. I left feeling sad and hungry this is not the norm for The Keg. On a high note, I would like to compliment the nice waitress, she went above and beyond to make the experience exceptional at every level. She was delightful and made great suggestions, we do not want this to go unsaid. She provided exceptional service and a superb dining atmosphere. 
Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this location to friends and family due to our meal experience and after all, that's why I chose the Keg for their steaks. If possible I hope The Keg management will reach out to me. Regards, Leanne King",2
"Seats were to low vs table height, may be okay for 6ft people but for shorter people was very uncomfortable.",2
"Food, Service, Staff and Upper Patio were amazing!",4
We love the appetizers and the steaks. It was a scrumptious meal. The servers and the host were very attentive and professional. Thanks for accomodating us to this special occasion. You've helped us create a lovely memory of dining at your restaurant. We anticipate creating more fond memories at your restaurant in the near future. Congratulations on maintaining such a great vibe at your restaurant both among staff and with the diners!,4
Best restaurant I’ve ever been,4
"Nice roof patio, food and service were excellent.",4
Loved the ambience. Outdoor patio was so nice. Would go back again.,4
Enjoyed the patio.. Staff were amazing. Food was delicious. A great evening out. Couldn't ask for more,4
Have tried several keg locations and their standards are consistent. Our server was really kind and considerate. Will definitely continue to come to the keg for special occasions!,4
Very good patio and good staff. The food was delish as always and will come back,4
Such a pleasure to be able to have dinner at a restaurant once again. The Keg is our favourite!,4
Great service!!,4
Perfect night out as always. Keg is always a good choice. Staff is friendly.,4
Great patio upstairs away from the street. Well spaced out tables and comfy chairs. Food was great as always.,4
"Service was exceptionally great. However, the foods could be better.",2
Excellent service.  Appreciate a dessert for our anniversary and we got to celebrate with our kids,4
"Our waiter Shannon was amazing and polite, constantly checked up on us to see how we were doing. Will 100% come back to this
location",4
"They serve amazing twice baked potato  which is my favorite. If I can,  I want it every  week.  also the steak is awesome,  I have  never had such amazing steak before. It would be perfect if I can have prime rib.",4
"Best experience ever! Been to different keg locations but this location is by far the best we’ve tried. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Food was amazing and cooked perfectly. Was seated on the patio, a little chilly but the outdoor heated made our experience very memorable.",4
Great dining during covid! Couldn’t ask for anything bette. Lowkey second floor patio !,4
"We were very happy just to get out and sit on a patio again. 
They staff were all amazing and followed protocol completely. 
Needless to say, we will be sitting on that patio again soon!",4
"From start to finish everything was excellent. Food was exceptional. Great ambience, patio was beautiful.",4
My fiancée 60 Birthday,3
"Thank you for the great service, food and ambiance this was my first time at this location and was very impressed
Especially during these times..
Appreciate al you do
Looking forward to seeing you soon! 
Appreciated! Thanks",4
As good as always,4
Great COVID protocols,4
"It was great, we celebrated a birthday. We had a nice private dining room for our family of 5.",4
We had a family dinner for my husban’s birthday. Joyce was serving and she did a fantastic job in making us feel special. The food was great as usual. We’ll certainly go back to this location more frequently. Thanks Joyce and thanks the Keg!,4
"Our server was very friendly, attentive and professional!",4
"great service! very attentive, food was delivered on time",4
Great staff and perfect ambiance.,4
"Always great food, service, ambience.",3
"Nice place to enjoy the meal in a quiet place . Social distancing and sanitizing was also very well regulated.  Unlike some of other restaurants with lots of fuss about the situation, they made customers comfortable so we could enjoy the moments. Good service overall.",3
"Joyce our server was excellent and the manager Andria.  

Great tine overall",4
Celebration,4
My wife’s birthday,4
"Shawn was our server and lets just say he made our family experience awesome!
He offered great food recommendations, was bright and genuinely happy to serve us.
Kudos to him and your team.",4
"Good food, only couple croutons in ceasar salad, service was not attentive enough and felt rushed when server was attending, yet food took long time to arrive. Overall did not have fine dining feel, which was disappointing , especially since was around $60 per person for food.",3
"This was the first time we'd been to a restaurant since Coronavirus.  It was a great experience.  We felt safe and our server was wonderful.  Social distancing rules were in place and masks were worn by everyone that wasn't seated at a table.  The food was fabulous, as usual.  I'm so glad we went!!!",4
"Server was great! Food was delish, I ordered a rare steak but it arrived medium rare which was fine. My friends who ordered medium rare got their medium rare. Always a great night at the Keg.",3
Our bar tender was so friendly and enthusiastic about the wines and food!,4
Service was excellent,4
"Amazing service, there was a mix up on the steak size but still pretty good.",3
"Almost non of covid protocols were applied.  Next table to us were les than a meter apart. Servants touches everything from other tables and served us. They put other cutlery on table which was not sure was disinfected. 
We ordered fillet mignon and bacon wee all burnt. We asked to replace it, they brought it back with another unprepared and well cooked bacon and food was already cold. Manager did came to our table and didnt care at all.  Everything was disappointing and the only a bit bearable was servant behavior which she was friendly. 
We were regular customers which before pandemic at least once month had dinner there.  But i will never step in there. 

Tooooo disappointing and not recommended at all...!",0
Raquel is very professional and patient. The location is relatively new and free parking on the side street after 6pm. The food has great value.,4
Great service and great food! Will be definitely be back!,4
Always the best!!!!,4
The meat was so soft. Nooo good. And the service was bad .,1
"We really enjoyed the wine and the items from the new lunch menu.    The service was also great.   Unfortunately, the noise from the street was extremely loud and the patio high chairs were not all that comfortable.   I think the next time, we will just go for normal inside seating.   Looking forward to trying some of the other new items on the menu.   Thanks!",3
"We ordered 2 filet mignon, 1 tuna tartar, and 1 calamari. All food and service were excellent!",4
Awesome ambience!,4
"We asked for a quiet table with low traffic. We were tabled beside front door and kitchen. We had about 1/2 dozen people walk by with in 5 minutes. We moved, food is always good. Staffs great, friendly.",3
Birthday dinner.,4
Food and service was great (Andres).  There was a loud couple near us that was arguing also but our experience was still great.,4
"We were celebrating the birthday of my son.
The restaurant called me 30 minutes before the appointment telling me that they want us to sit indoors. I objected and told the person that we booked 3 days in advance and we knew about the expected rain... we know the patio is fully covered with ceiling. She said they said many reservations outside. So I told her we will arrive on time as scheduled.
Second negative problem was 3 of the 5 steaks we ordered arrived with wrong cooking. 2 Medium well steaks arrived well done and 1 medium well steak arrived medium with blood.
Unfortunately this is not expected when we dine in the Keg.
The manager apologized and made a discount on the bill but it wasn’t a good experience for our celebration.",2
Great meal and environment for our first dine in experience since COVID. Well done The Keg!,4
The staff were excellent and the food tasted amazing!,4
Great venue and ambience food is always good. Overall great place,4
Everything was excellent,4
"First time visiting this location. Definitely our new favorite and will definitely be coming back. Food, service, everything was excellent. Nothing even remotely bad.",4
"Server was friendly, moved us to a booth upon request as it was later at night and not too busy. Food is always reliable and well prepared. You know what you're going to get and it's always good. Luckily for me I live around the corner :)",3
Not the usual Keg service.  Our server was missing in action for long periods at a time!,0
"We felt very welcomed on arrival and the waiter, Aru, was very obliging.",4
The food and ambiance was great.  I would come back again.,4
"We've enjoyed many a Happy Hour at The Keg, and decided to have dinner in the upstairs dining room. The ambience was delightful; or calamari appetizer and steaks were perfect. The only flaw was the service: The martini orders were incorrect, and we had no sooner finished our entrees, than the book was left at our table. Not a good thing.",3
"It was great
Michael was amazing at helping in everything",4
Good food but meh service,3
This new location is very well laid out and the seating arrangements are great. Food and service were excellent.,4
The service was efficient and friendly without feeling like we were being rushed. The food was prepared very well and cooked as requested. When in the area we would recommend this location.,4
"Sour dough bread delicious, fresh and soft inside, crusty outside. A must try. 
Scallops wrapped in bacon appetizer delicious. Very hot temperature wise. Be careful not to burn yourself. 
Filet Mignon and Prime Rib medium rare very good. 
Unfortunately vegetables were lukewarm. 2nd floor a bit drafty.",3
"Always a good experience at The Keg. Food was good but the service was even better. Rochelle (idk if that’s spelled right) was great and strikes a good balance between being present and leaving us alone to talk. She was knowledgeable about wine and cocktails and I think she’d make a fantastic bartender! 
I got the Oscar Sirloin (something like that) and I asked for it cooked medium rare and it was definitely more rare, but I enjoyed it none the less. 
All around a good experience, though aside from a good server nothing made it life changing.",2
"Service, while professional , alternated between attentive and unavailable. The kitchen was slow in getting out orders but everything was well-prepared and cooked to order. My suspicion that the restaurant was understaffed was confirmed by a ‘help wanted’ sign I noticed on departing.",2
The best Keg I have been to. Great new facility.  Clean.  Good kitchen.,4
It was a perfect restaurant experience. Our server was very attentive and friendly from the moment we sat down. All of our steaks were prepared exactly as we asked and they were all excellent. We ahve been to The Keg before and will definitely return.,4
Service and food were great - birthday cakes were a nice addition,4
Good attentive staff,3
"Nice restaurant with a nice dining room, artificial wood fire, dark ambience, soft light, very comfortable.
Good quality food, tasty selection of meat different style",3
"I’m keg regular customer
Great service",4
"Daughters steak was undercooked. Noise level high due to crying child. The at the end of the evening, our waiter dropped our plates when he was clearing the table. Ketchup spilled all over the table and on my daughters sweater. The waiter apologized but I didn’t think that was good enough.  No concessions were offered. Needless to say, we won’t be coming back anytime soon.",1
"Great service, food, atmosphere",4
"The waiter was friendly, attentive and the food was  great.",4
Chinese Lunar New Year,4
"Great service and delicious food,will suggest to my friends",4
Delicious week night dinner,4
Terrific server. Delicious food.  Ambience was warm and cosy,3
My fiancé and I were celebrating our engagement. We informed our server of his shellfish allergy. Generally we have somebody else delivery our food because of his allergy. But that didn’t happen tonight. To add insult to injury we had been for an allergy test that day and he showed his arm with hives to him. Later on in the evening I saw the waiter touch a glass from a table next to us who had ordered seafood appetizers and then delivered our dessert. I spent the rest of my night worrying that we hadn’t picked up an EPI pen. This is my second bad experience at this restaurant. We had our first date there and I’m so disappointed.,1
"The server was great. Appetizer was delicious (calamari). However, tenderloin was a bit chewy and tough at medium rare.",3
"We pleasantly surprised when we found The Keg has upgraded it the ambience and the menu since going there last several years ago!  Our compliments to the chef.
The food was very good except...the bread is not so great.  
Check out the bread at Cheesecake Factory...white, multi grain and pumpernickel something for everyone!
The lobster tail I was told did not taste good and very stringy.  The cost was removed from the bill.
My daughter and I are vegan, we shared a cauliflower salad, side cauli mash and gnocchi and veg.  Excellent, we would order it again if there were no other options.  We are hoping time to choose from a larger selection of vegan food.",4
Very consistent quality and service,4
"I had a 2 people reservation for 9.15pm
 Restaurant were quite empty, plenty of available seats. They made us sit just in front of kitchen.so loud noises coming from kitchen, and heavy food trafic. They said other tables are all reservation
We spend 1 hour and all those tables were empty until the time we left.",2
"Prime rib disappointing. Mostly tasteless, horseradish too strong, at jus became just a lot of the same. Filet mignon was great. Terribly slow service. Would not go to this location again.",2
Bday dinner for mom. Meat were not cooked to order.,4
Consistently a good experience.,4
The food was on the salty side but nothing big to complain about.  We went there on New Year's Eve and we were happy that the restaurant didn't impose on a $150/person menu.  Very good service.  Will go back.,3
New Year’s Eve!,4
Took my boyfriend for his birthday. We started with the garlic cheese shrimp which was absolutely delicious! I ordered the bacon wrapped fillet mignon and he ordered the the rib eye. Both wonderful! Atmosphere was nice and not too loud. Highly recommend!,4
Steak was good but under seasoned. Rest of food was good. Average steaks in a nice setting. But good value if you don’t want to cook at home.,3
"Poor service received at the North York location. Made a 7:30pm reservation and they did not seem to reserve us a table at all. Received really poor service the entire night, waitress said she is taking drinks and app orders first and she left the table after taking drinks order and appetizer order from just 2 out of 9 guests at the table!!?? Had to ask for bread after the appetizer came, servers had no idea who got which appetizer, it was just all a mess. Clearly said 5 of us sharing a bottle, waitress had such a bad pour that she filled 4 glasses (super uneven pour) and one person left with nothing. The bill was a nightmare as well. We question if they sent trainees out to serve us last night . Won’t return again",1
Everything was amazing. Our server Yasmin took great care of us. Thank you,4
Great night with Friends,4
"Christmas Eve dinner with all the family! Excellent service!! All our steaks were done exactly as each person had ordered, everything delicious!!",4
Pre holiday dinner with family,3
Enjoy the evening. Food was very good and the service was exceptional.,4
Great service. Perfect accommodations for our holiday lunch,4
"Great for a first date, casual get together.   Food is consistent and service is amazing.",4
Outstanding service and food.  Service and atmospheres were amazing,4
"Great food quality, consistently good experience, great for dinner events of all kinds. Celebrated two birthday this year and it was great from start to finish.",4
"Our meal was ending as we celebrate our Mom’s birthday when our server gave us free desert with lit candle. We’re a very low key shy type family so we didn’t want any attention of singing one for my Mom (we did it privately dont worry. We could have paid for it anyway but Yet this gesture was very special to us. 
To your team, we cannot thank you enough for it. It was touching for us!! And we hope you guys have a very great Holiday ♥️",4
My Note on Birthday Surprise was totally ignored. Had expected the note will be comminicated with resturant and appointed servants in advance which unfortunately was not the case.,2
Most of the meals were not cooked to the temperature as requested but because this was a business meal no one complained or sent their meal back. The dining room didn't seem to be very busy so there should have been no excuse for it.,3
We had great service.  Waiter was very accommodating.  Would definitely go recommend,3
Service was amazing! Very attentive and respectful of my keto diet... my friend and I were celebrating our birthdays... she received a complimentary piece of delicious cake and I was not left out and received a tea... it was nice that I was not disregarded because of my limitations. Food was good as always!,4
"Our server, Natalie, was excellent - pleasant and helpful throughout service. Our food was great as always.",4
"The service and food was excellent...a little to noisy due to a celebration next to my table. (not a fault). Over all I can also rely on the Keg for outstanding food and beverage.

Thank you",4
We held out team holiday lunch for 7 of us at this location. We were seated in a nice private area where we could chat and hear each other speak and also not disturb other individual diners. Brett our server was very accommodating and helpful and both he and the manger took great care to assist one of our team with regard to some food allergies. It was a great experience and I think we have started a tradition!,4
"Just let your customers know that the $5.00 parking starts at 5pm across the street. 
We got to the parking lot at 4:55 and the parking meter did not have The Keg selection to park for $5.00 for the evening.  We ended up paying $13.50.",4
Always good value and fantastic staff.  A well priced steak for smal or big occasions!,4
Waiter seemed to be rushed forgot our appetizer. Other than that great service,3
Great dinner,4
The food and drinks were really sub par. The food was mostly tasteless. Not a good experience.,0
The food is consistently excellent as was the service,4
"Great atmosphere, service, and amazing food. Little something extra for birthday celebrations.",4
"Our server Joanna, was incredible.  She was there when we needed her and she respected our privacy.  Made great suggestions for our meals as well.  Food was good Keg food.  Really no complaints but Joanna was amazing!",3
Fantastic service!,4
Everything was great. The only thing was we were placed beside a mom with 2 kids probably around 10-12 years old and they were a bit noisy. Maybe don’t place a couple next to a mom with kids.,4
"Waited too long for our table as lots of tables were just not cleared.  Then we were put into a really awful booth - next to kids and looking at 5 tables that were not cleared of dishes.  We waited a ridiculous amount of time to even be asked for drinks. I asked to move - what bothered me was, why didn’t they ask where we wanted to sit or at least offer the nice lounge area? Just seemed that they weren’t paying attention to detail.",4
You can always count on getting a great meal every timem,4
This location always has great service. Upstairs dining room is great. Steaks and salmon were both cooked to satisfaction.,4
Great service and food.,4
We were seated at an oval table next to a major hallway. The bench seat was not comfortable for one of the members of our party,3
Terrible service. Came for my girlfriends surprise birthday and had a booking for 9pm. They ruined the Surprise as they had us going from table to table until they can accommodate us at 9:30. The waiter offered us complementary drinks while we waited in the bar area and we still got charge for them almost $40. I didn’t wanna say anything that night and cause a scene and ruin my girlfriends birthday anymore than he was. I brought a cake with me and gave it to the waiter in the beginning before my girlfriend arrives and ask him to bring it to us at the end. Our waiter decides to bring the cake after food while I’m in the bathroom and not present and completely ruined your surprise then took the cake back to bring it again when I come back when everybody already saw the cake including my girlfriend. I am very disappointed in the service of this location of cakI brought a cake with me and gave it to the waiter in the beginning before my girlfriend arrives ask him to bring it to us at the end. Our waiter decides to bring the cake after food while I’m in the bathroom I’m not present and completely ruined the surprise Dan took the cake back to bring it again when I come back with everybody already saw the cake including my girlfriend. I am very disappointed in the service of this location of Keg.,0
"Baseball cut was a little tough in certain spots, second time this has happened. Other cuts were fine with my party.",3
Fabulous service and a great dinner.  This Keg is terrific.,4
Lived up to the Keg standard. Was accommodating for a last minute large group.,4
"Same as last two times, food was simply not good enough for a Keg. Somehow this location cannot figure out the food part, which is surprising since most Kegs are very consistent. Service was friendly but kept forgetting things. I guess enthusiasm versus actual skill set. Sad as this is the one next to our house. I will have to keep going to the one on Leslie, which is by far better for both service and food.

Wrote a similar review the last time and got no response or comments. Not sure why it helps.",1
Food wasnt as tasty as it normally is,4
never disappoints  i ordered the wrong steak  and supervisor went above the call of duty to make me happy  always the best value for the money  we go to this keg about twice a month,4
"Our waitress, Emily, was great. She was friendly and helpful. 
The food was really good. It's way better than the location at Beaver Creek area ( do not go there).",4
"Food was cold, did not meet expectations. Would not recommend this location.",3
"I have eaten at a lot of Kegs but this was the worst meal I have had at one of the Kegs.  I ordered the steak frites which comes with a 6oz steak and fries.  The fries were ok, and not hot but the steak must have had at least 2 oz of fat and gristle on it.

I made mention to the server simply as constructive criticism.  They comped a specialty coffee and Dessert at the end that totalled $15 but my meal was $27 so I was not impressed by that and further not impressed by the fact that the chef or sous chef or whoever was cooking that night did not come out and st least acknowledge the hunk of fat that was on my plate.

I am not sure I will be going back to that Keg.",2
Anniversary,3
Great night! Service was a little slow.,3
"We thoroughly enjoyed our experience at The Keg on Friday evening. 
From the time that we entered we felt welcome. The front desk staff was friendly and polite and projected a completely professional image.
Our server, a young lady from St. Vincent could not possibly be any better. We were quite favourably impressed with her demeanour and she went about her duties in an efficient and pleasant manner. (Her name unfortunately slips my mine).
We shared a Caesar salad and we each opted for the Steak Frites. Both were par excellence.
All in all it was a very enjoyable and memorable experience. We plan on revisiting and will be recommending  this to friends.",4
"Surprisingly, this was a bad visit.  While the service was excellent, our main courses were ice cold.  The French fies came hot!
The manager did offer us a very kind gesture however, we would have preferred a normal Keg visit.",0
We had visitors from overseas and we all thoroughly enjoyed our meals.  Great service ambience and reasonable,4
"Steak was over seasoned - very very salty, baked potato skin was burnt, pistachio nuts on salmon were burnt and had to be scraped off, halibut was dry and tasteless, brussel sprouts were so hard they were inedible.  Service was very very slow",1
"The Keg is always a fantastic venue. 
Food always cooked up perfectly. 
This location is pretty good, that being said - the only downside is that the bathrooms are upstairs and quite a flight of stairs when you're in a hurry or hungry. Other than that, it's a great venue. Would highly recommend.",4
"We had an awesome time.  The Keg never fails us for all our family special occasions and we have many
This location was a first time visit and it is lovely.  
The food is awesome.  The baseball sirloin is my favorite and is always cooked to perfection.  
Our waitress was very attentive and listened to us when we requested a bit more time between apps and our main so we could take our time 
Great job!
We always recommend the Keg!!!",4
"Service was very good.  Filet Mignon was one of the best. Noise level was high.  Overall, a great place to dine.",3
Teriyaki sirloin and filet mignon are excellent. Decor and atmosphere are great,4
We had a fantastic time as the waitress and staff went above and beyond as we both had allergies.,4
"I put this on the Keg's webpage:

We paid our first visit to this Keg yesterday, and it was every bit as attractive, welcoming and comfortable as all the other branches we've visited. What impressed us most, however, was the instant reaction we got to a small complaint/comment I made, about one of the less expensive steaks we ordered being a little chewy. The manager was most concerned, and the Keg style was handsomely evidenced by the fact that the cost of that serving was removed entirely from our bill, as well as the cost of a glass of red wine I had ordered to go with the steak. Thank you, Keg and staff: we'll be back.",3
"Nice to be able to reserve a table at this restaurant. We had a nice, relaxed evening, although the ambient sound level, even upstairs where it's quieter than downstairs, still bothers me.",4
"Celebrated my mother’s birthday and had a great celebration. Andreas, our server, made the evening extra enjoyable and his service was impeccable. Wonderful experience.",4
"It's the best choice for before a performance at the Meridian Arts Centre.  Our waiter, a lovely gentleman who had just come back from Vietnam and Cambodia, (Andreas? not sure, sorry) was exceptional.  He really deserves a pat on the back or better yet, a raise!",4
"Our evening started with an awesome experience from our friendly waiter, Alex. Before ordering, Alex was able to explain the difference between the Prime Rib, Top Sirloin and the New York Striploin. I ended up getting a medium New York Striploin with veggies, and my wife got the pistachio-crusted salmon. Our food came out perfectly timed. We also got the baked shrimp as an appetizer. My steak came out medium-well on one side, but it was perfectly medium on the other end, so my meal was amazing (ending the steak experience with the best part). Alex was really good overall and got us a Billy Miner ice cream cake to finish off our anniversary dinner. Thanks again, North York Keg!",4
"We had very enjoyable meals. Salmon, shrimp, drinks, sides, etc. All were very good,",3
We we’re seated at our table at the reservation time but that was the only thing they executed well on. From the time of ordering to the time the main meal arrived at our table was 1 hour. We ordered prime rib and two out of the three we ordered arrived cold and over cooked and had a really beefy taste to it. The steak was cooked well but it was tough and it was like biting into a piece of leather. For the price they charge the meal should have been better quality.,1
Great food. Great atmosphere. Staff very friendly.  Thank you so much for a great experience.,4
"Great service, great food, great atmosphere!!! This location very fancy",4
Food and service were good. Make sure you save room for the Billy Miner Pie!,3
This is honestly one of the Best Keg locations ever.... keep up the portions and amazing work guys !!!!,4
Always great place to go for a birthday dinner.,3
"Birthday 
Always reliable and delicious",4
"Best customer services I have ever experienced. Waitress and receptionist had tried every possible way to accommodate our needs, even during a busy FULL house Saturday evening, with a friendly smile always on their faces. Highly recommended to everyone who loved The Keg to experience this location on Yonge St,  just south of Finch Ave. Great food!",4
Usually this location is great but this time the service was a little over bearing with our conversation being interrupted at times every 5 mins. Also I ordered the top sirloin which should have minimal fat on it but I had to cut away a decent sized chunk of it. Definitely a great location but just this experience was sub par for Keg standards,2
"We really enjoyed our dinner at the new keg location in North York. The atmosphere was quiet and relaxing. All the staff were friendly and our server, Joe, took great care of us. We had the keg burgers which were yummy. The other thing we really appreciated was the accessibility of the place. The doors have automatic open buttons and there was a accessible washroom which also had automatic open buttons with lots of room for a wheelchair.",4
From the moment we sat down to the end of the meal our server was a delight. Highly reommend,4
"Nice patio.  Our waitress was ok.  Brought the bill unasked while I was still drinking my coffee (which my friend, who is a restaurant-owner, did not appreciate).  Also did not ask if I wanted cream or milk with my coffee and didn't bring any when she brought my coffee.",3
We like the consistency of food and service at the Keg...our waiter on this visit was extraordinary!,3
Birthday - enjoyed our dinner along with great customer service!,4
"The Keg is still good, but it used to be a lot better. Our waiters changed during our dinner because he was too busy. The waitress who took over was nice enough, though. But meal was still slow coming out.",2
Love the Keg. The food is always consistently good. Bianca our server was very professional and so friendly.,4
After using this location for many celebrations we were disappointed with the service and food. Will probably plan our next celebration somewhere else,2
"Fancy restaurant and great food  drinks and desserts, will definitely go back.",4
"Outstanding service with special attention to allergies by managers. Sirloin steak, prime ribs and lobster appetizer was amazing!",4
"We had wonderful attentive service and the food was great, but it was slightly noisy and a little bit chilly in there! Will go back!",4
"The lobsterfest that was going on was great. It might have been nice to have a few more options for appetizers with lobster in it like a lobster bisque. I have the seafood sirloin. It was delicious!
Billy Miner pie is always a favorite to share for dessert.",4
"As usual, the Keg is consistent in their service, food quality and taste and overall experience.  The waitstaff are unfailingly pleasant, helpful and accommodating and this particular location seems to be less noisy than others and accepts Saturday night reservations.  We always look forward to dining at any of the Kegs, but this is our favorite.  Yes, we would recommend it for a special occasion or for steak house fans who want to be sure of having a quality meal.",4
"The food was well prepared,and the service was divine. Definitely give it a go.",4
"Un excellent service et une très bonne proposition pour le vin. Le bacon pour le plat de pétoncles bacon aurait pu être un peu plus cuit. La pièce de steak était cuite à point comme demandé. Comme dessert, le Billy Miner Pie est à se jeter par terre. Mais c’est énorme pour une seule personne. Bref, une bonne prestation.",2
"Wonderful place for reunion with friends dinner,  prime rib always done right. Perfect ambiance to eat and make new memories. All guests very satisfied, and  friends wish to take Keg Steakhouse back to London, UK!",4
"As usual, the staff at this Keg location were outstanding.  Attentive, quick to respond and very pleasant.  Food was good except one of our companions had a problem with his steak, it was undercooked.  But the problem was rectified very quickly and everyone had a great evening.",3
"For 2 people, ordered New York striploin, peppercorn New York (striploin), escargot, French onion soup and crab cakes. All of the food items were great and steaks doneness met our expectations. 

Came for a 5:30 reservation and was seated immediately in a cushy booth seat in the lower dining area room. 

Overall we had a nice experience tonight - food was delicious, service was prompt and our server Chris was excellent.",3
Had a good time. Happy with the food and overall experience.,4
The prime rib was excellent and the service was well-timed.  The Billy Miner ice cream cake was a nice bday gesture.  We will be coming back!,4
"I am a devotee of the Keg, my regular restaurant is the Richmond Hill one. I  had eaten at the Winnipeg location on business a few days earlier. The new one in North York is visually beautiful.  My sister and I were taking by brother to dinner for his birthday but wanted that to be a secret. We had just arranged a get together dinner. We put Happy Birthday and his name in the reservation. I called several hours earlier to confirm they knew it was my brother's b-day. They said yes (and I know the Keg is great...ususally bring a dessert with candle). But I told the hostess it was a surprise. No sooner did we sit down at the table than our server says ""So are we celebrating anything today?"" I had to lie. The noise level at our table was so high we asked to be moved and the only option was a more shabbier table in the bar, but that was fine. We had our meal and at the end our new server had no idea it was a b-day, so I had to cryptically say...did you check the reservation file. Clearly there was poor communication between front of the house, first server and second server. On top of that, because I was eating so much steak in the past week, I ordered the tuna for the first time at the Keg and it was cold, dry on the outside and flavourless. I consider this a blip in the screen in an otherwise great chain.",2
"This Keg lives up to my and my guests' expectations for a Keg - the best food and value for money in that industry. The restaurants are consistently reliable whether you are in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Halifax, Scottsdale or the many others I have visited. If there is a problem (very rare) no other restaurant handles it better.",4
Excellent service from our waiter.   Nice atmosphere.  Will definitely return.,3
Was the perfect place to celebrate my birthday!,4
Great place to have a meal. The patio is very nice. Food prices have gone up a lot.  That’s too bad.,4
First time visit to the North York/Yonge location.  Nice upstairs area.  Great decor.  Server was friendly and attentive.  Food was good but the blueberry lemonade wasn't as good as the York St. Keg.  Prime Rib and cauliflower mash was delicious.  Billy Miner pie slice was huge.  Will definitely come back.,3
"This restaurant is very new so it looks nice and modern looking - The food was delicious as usual (the prime rib was perfectly medium rare) and the service was great.  We arrived about 15min earlier than our reservation and they had no problem seating us right away.  My friend and I hadn't seen each other in a while so we were busy catching up and our server was patient and gave us lots of time to chat, never rushing us to order or to leave later on either.  Highly recommend!!",4
You chose to eat at the Keg as the food is consistent with your past experiences at their other locations and always meets your expectations.,3
The food we ordered were very salty. It ruined the favours of the food itself.,3
Great waiter very attentive service amazing food and we got a free dessert to celebrate our anniversary. Highly reccomend this location.,4
"Yes, definitely I would recommend this Keg to a friend.  I would like to try the patio.  I will absolutely be returning.",4
"Loved The Keg Steakhouse Saturday night!!  It was a special occasion, my mom's 90th birthday.  We were served by Joanna who was wonderful!!  The service was fantastic and the food was delicious.  Thank you for a wonderful evening!!",4
Good customer service good food,4
"Everything was just...fine. Nothing that really blows your mind, which is kinda disappointing because the Keg used to be a really great experience. The hosting staff seemed a big disorganized, we were seated quickly because we had a reservation but those without a reservation were waiting even though there were a ton of empty tables and it looked like quite a few servers just hanging out. The food was fine, nothing wrong with it but there wasn’t anything that we ohh’d and ahh’d over how good it was. Honestly, I keep coming back for the Billy Miner pie because it’s a childhood comfort. If the Keg didn’t have that, I would find another chain restaurant for a standard steak and potato meal.",1
"Birthday dinner for my husband, wonderful time .",4
Food and ambience is great as always. We were celebrating my husband’s birthday. Even though I told them at the time of reservation and reminded them when I checked in and again to our waitress... it was missed. We left without getting a cake.,2
We always get the 10 inch prime ribbat the Keg but this time both our prime ribs were so small. Looked more like a 6-7 inch steak. We didnt say anything as they already served it but very disappointed server didnt notice. Will most likely not return to this location.,0
Our waitress Bianca was fabulous.  Very professional.  She provided excellent service,4
Our waiter was great! So was the food. Wish there was on sight parking though.,4
"The whole evening was a lovely experience. The food as always was excellent and the waitress was very obliging and knowledgeable about food. 
We were celebrating our 60th wedding anniversary, and it was a totally great experience.
Thank you .",3
"One meal sent back, steak has too rare",3
"We love it here! We've always loved the Keg, but thr cozy ambiance and friendly service will keep us coming back.",4
Service was great. Pretty chic interior and location.,4
"The restaurant is very nice, well located and the food is delicious.  I will suggest to improve the service.",3
My food came out over cooked and there were no prime ribs left in the restaurant.,0
Good food and wonderful service.  I would recommend bringing your date here.,4
Easy booking and good experience. this is one of my favorite Keg location,4
"Great experience, I went to celebrate my university graduation! Servers were very kind and they gave me a free slice of amazing cake! Food tasted great portions were large and filling! Would recommend for special occasions",4
"Food, service and ambiance were very good....only comment is music is too loud and not suited for dinner music....I could see perhaps it was okay in the bar but not in the dining area...",3
We really enjoyed our evening at the North York Keg.  We had been there once previously and the food was not in keeping with other Keg restaurants.  But this visit was a home run.  Excellent food and wonderful service.,4
Our service Adrian was excellent.  Very personable and engaging. He handled a small issue very appropriately.,3
Our server was Andres and he was awesome very nice and gave good recommendations.,3
"As usual the Keg was a good meal at a reasonable price.  This location was very busy and quite noisy.  It was difficult to have a decent conversation.  Service was very good and the food came in a very reasonable time.  I will return to the Keg, but possible not this location.  Like I said it was noisy and the parking situation was definitely not great.",3
Belated birthday—why do they bring Billy Minor cake for four people with no extra plates for everyone. ! And when you ask they bring you hot plates for ice cream. EVERRY TIME. I THINK our server was over tired,2
Amazing as always,4
"Surprisingly, the service was just ok (no enthusiasm, nothing special) and the food was not as good as usual - our prime ribs clearly had been cut in advance and sat there for a while. We are regular at this place, and the Keg in general, and it’s the first time I left disappointed. It was not busy either so I don’t know why the poor experience this time.",1
Very nice ambiance,4
"Was disappointed this time around, ordered French Onion soup (my favourite) and twice it came out burnt. Gave up on that and ordered the baked brie, that came out under cooked. Service was decent but not the greatest, understandable though as it was Game 6 in the NBA play offs. usually have great food and great service but was not impressed this time around, briefly spoke to the manager but as it was so busy I do not think he was overly concerned that we were not having a great experience.  Overall disappointing but hey ho!",1
Came for a late dinner on date night. Got a nice table on the patio and our server Alex took very good care of us. The hostesses greeted us upon arrival and we were seated instantly. Drinks came out fast and food was amazing. Will definitely be coming back.,4
"First off, two of the three place settings and cutlery on the table were visibly dirty. The restaurant wasn’t busy (5 pm sitting) yet it took a while for the food to arrive. While we waiting we were giving bread with only one butter. My filet mignon was not the best but it was hot, the mushroom side and veggies were cool to the touch and cold before done. Server disappeared. We were going to have desert but ran out of time. Had to ask passing staff to get our server. I won’t go back to this location.",1
We celebrated my mom's 89th birthday. We all enjoyed our steak meals. The free desert was a nice touch. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. Great evening!,4
Some of our food arrived cold.  Server was excel at handling the situation but by the time the replacement food arrived the others were finished eating.  Not a great experience.,2
Always the best,4
Mother’s Day,4
"it is my 2nd visit, but we were arranged on a table in the middle of  aisle. The table is too small for 3 adult. I will still recommend the keg north york to my friends, but next visitI will mentioned that i want sofa seat .",2
"Great service, from making the reservation, to revising the reservation, to on-site service before, during and after dinner.  Well done by ALL!!",4
"It was Saturday at 430PM when we arrived and I approached the receptionist for my reservation. She told me to wait for 1 minute as the table is being prepared. After 20 minutes of waiting, I follow up with the same receptionist and surprisingly she didn't know that I was waiting for my reservation. She forgot that I approached her and she had me wait. It was not even a busy time to forget your client.",4
I like my filet mignon blue and it is always prepared perfect!  Other steak places don't get it right.,4
Wonderful..our server Kevin was charming and attentive!,4
"First time at this location since they moved from a couple of blocks away.  This location, like other TO Kegs, provided perfect value for money.  Service was impeccable and the mains - in this case, prime rib and a strip with lobster - were excellent.  The side of lobster tails were good.  This was a first date, and I was delighted that nothing took away from the experience.",4
"when my main course came the steak was not cooked the way I requested, the server agreed and said he would return with another meal.  Twenty minutes later (after my wife had finished her meal) he finally returned with another steak, it was satisfactory, however I wasn't interested in eating my meal as my wife was finished.
The manager did bring us a complimentary glass of wine which also took considerable time to arrive and they did comp my meal.  
It was a disappointing experience as the The |Keg is one of our favorite restaurants and usually very good.",0
Joyce served us and she was both professional and personable! The food as well as cooked to perfection and delivered somewhat promptly.,4
Server was excellent as was my teriyaki steak and garden salad!!,3
"Service was good but a little slow on some things for our liking.  Food was good. My wife said her tenderloin lacked taste, however my prime rib was excellent.  Ordered the cheese bread for an appetizer.  There was some kind of cheese on it that I did not like, so it was pretty much a bust.",3
Wonderful service. Great food. Excellent wine selection.,3
"This is the first time we went to the North York location. We usually go to the Yonge and Eglinton and Leslie locations. 

We ordered the calamari as an appetizer but the portion and size of the actual calamari was very small compared to the other locations which was disappointing. 

It was our son’s 7th birthday as I indicated in the reservation notes, even reminded the server. Usually they do something special for birthdays. We finished our meals. Noticed the cake and candle were taking a bit long so we reminded the server once again it was his birthday. Not a very good experience service wise. We’ll stick to our regular locations.",1
Great food and service! Glad we came to this location,4
"Lovely Keg location, first time at this one, used to go to the one at Yonge Sheppard Centre.",4
dinner was excellent.  10th anniversary dinner.  No complaints,4
"There were two celebrations  for the dinner and three guests, one was a birthday and one was a job promotion. The staff did a good job of celebrating the birthday but had absolutely no acknowledgement towards the job promotion. This guest worked very hard to get the promotion so the lack of anyone caring was surprising. In the future I will not be celebrating any occasion at the Keg. It was extremely disappointing and embarrassing. The food was good as always but there are other steakhouses in Toronto.",1
Nice decor. Food was fine. Server was attentive. Open table can’t book for more than 4 people which is a bit inconvenient.,3
Great atmosphere and service. Great if you are watching what your diet,4
Asked for medium steak got well done. If immpaying 50$ for a steak the least they can do is get it done right.,1
Service is slow upstairs on a weekday... constantly had to look for our server for anything we needed...,3
"Amazing place especially for a special occasion. Food perfectly cooked and ambiance had a great vibe. A must try! Don't forget to ask for 3 cheese butter with your bread, you will love me if you did haha!",4
"Great location, great food and service!  Our server Joyce was fantastic.  Thank you for a great evening!",4
We had great service. The hostess remembered my wife and I from a previous visit. It is nice to be remembered. Our waiter was friendly and professional. The food as always at the Keg was properly prepared and nicely presented.,4
"While the food is consistently good, our most recent Keg experience was very lack lustre. Our server didn’t even acknowledge our existence for the first 10 minutes we sat at our table, and then was very non-attentive our entire meal. He made us feel uncomfortable and rushed. It’s too bad, as we normally love the keg.",2
Excellent food and service!! The twice baked potatoes are delicious!,4
We had a very nice dinner. Ordered the Filet Mignon with double baked potatoes and was excellent like always.Service was fast and good. Noise level was low because was early afternoon.,4
"Food was amazing, service was great. Very attentive staff without being overbearing",4
The waiter was very kind and we felt very welcomed.,4
Great service and even greater food. You just can't go wrong with The Keg.,4
Quick and easy to reserve a table using OpenTable. Nothing could be simpler.,4
Server was incredible! Extremely attentive. Great food.,4
We celebrated our anniversary there. They gave us a huge ice cream on house. The food and service were up to expectation. Will come back again.,4
"Our server, Bianca, was excellent, efficient and personable without being intrusive and really paid attention to our requests and was successful on all counts.  The noise level was excellent - we could talk comfortably.  I had specifically asked for a table with at least 2 chairs and that was the one that they reserved for us.  All in all, every Keg is a great experience, but this Keg seems to be a cut above.",4
"As always, steak cooked to perfection and delish!
Only downside is Keg is becoming too costly.",3
Their ribs are amazing!,4
"Great fun w friends
Not rushed",4
"i live in the neighbourhood, and this is my first time having dinner at the new North York the keg location. I normally go to highway 7 and 404 location. The waiter is very friendly and nice. It was my birthday, service and food are all excellent. I will definitely go back to recommend my friends for it.",4
Birthday dinner,4
"Food was not only excellent but well done.  Service was not as fast as I wanted, but it happened.",3
"Crap food, there are much better steakhouses in Toronto",1
"This started off as a very poor experience. We had reservations for 7:15, we arrived on time and let the hostess know we were there. She told us it would be 2 minutes as they were just cleaning our table. 15 minutes go by and still nothing. After 20 min of waiting I went to ask what was going on and again I was told 2 more minutes because they were cleaning our table. I was very annoyed at this point, as it doesnt take 20 minutes to clean a table for 2 people. I expressed my frustration with her poor poor skills and she went to check. 5 min later she comes and tells us that she forgot to check off that we arrived, so they kept giving our table to other people. TERRIBLE HORRIBLE customer service and really ruined the vibe for our night, as we then had to rush through dinner to make it to our next set of plans. Not impressed at all",2
We had Michael and he was great! The food was good and we enjoyed ourselves,4
"Lovely waitress, food was yummy",4
"We had a date night at the Keg due to the closeness to home. This was our first time at this Keg location & they did not let us down.
We had a great time, food was fabulous, service great & topped off with an awesome bottle of Banfi Col De Sasso.
Thank you Keg",4
"The Keg is a favorite go to place and especially this one.
Something must have gone wrong this time. Our server was lovely and when she delivered our main course she was genuinely surprised that we had not yet received our salads. We canceled the salad.
I nearly always do lobster tails and did again. They were not hot and neither was the container with the usually bubbling hot butter.
I will certainly go back and perhaps mention the food temp when I am there.",2
Amazing steak !!!,4
"Our first night out as new parents, we could only get a 9:00pm reservation. We got there a little early to have a drink and ended up waiting over half an hour past our reservation time. There was no apology or anything. As soon as we got to our tiny table squished between a bunch of bigger groups, we noticed another couple who had arrived well after us get seated at a big booth. 
I ordered two drinks of the same thing during the night, and the first one was pretty bad and tasted like water but the second one actually seemed to have alcohol in it! I’m surprised about the disparity between the two. Anyway, overall the food was decent - I noticed the price increase.",2
"Great service,we had a great table at the corner,perfect for Valentine's night romantic dinner. I really liked French onion soup.",3
Always enjoy there,4
"Reception and Customer service are always high on my list.  All the staff throughout our visit were very hospitable and polite making the experience from start to finish, excellent.  Servicetimes were as expected and the staff communicated well if there was any delay.  Kudos to the staff and management taking care of the North York area.",4
"My server Bianca was really professional and knew what to recommend with my entree, she was super nice and very attentive and created overall a great experience. Always love coming to the Keg. :)",4
This location never disappoints.   Food (steak) is always spot on.  Location is very convenient for me.  My go-to place when I need something more than a home cooked steak.,4
Great service from Brandon !!!!!,4
"Whether you want something casual or to dress up and “flex” with some friends this locations atmosphere can suit both. The food tasted great with little to no reasonable wait, the waitress was also very patient and reasonable with my friend and I who were first timers for the keg. It is definitely a place I’ll go to eat again.",4
"Felt like steak, can always count on the keg for a good meal!",4
Really great service and beautiful environment. Food was delicious!,4
"All was great except two of the 5 steaks ordered were over cooked. Outside of that, it was 8 out of 10.",3
"Good food, great service,very comfortable surroundings.",3
Requested to be sat in the 1st floor dining room was told there was no space. Did not want to sit upstairs in an empty room. When i was adamant we were givenna spit at the rear next to a large and loud group of 25.  Not acceptable.,2
"Excellent service, staff were polite, prompt and interested in you as people/customers. Food was excellent, served in good time, just the right temperature . Background music was listenable - all in all a very good start to the evening",4
"It was my birthday - told the person that when I reserved 
Told hostess also when we arrived 
Waiter was not aware 
Service was slow and servers seemed overwhelmed",2
This is a new location do we wanted to try it out. We were happy to find that it as great as I had hoped it to be.   The server was very pleasant and helpful. The good was great - just as good as I remember from previous visits at the old location,4
"I love The Keg.
The servers make you feel welcome. They go out of their way to be of service.
Combine this with the amazing food, convenient location and overall, a great time had by all!",4
We love Keg. Our experience of food wasn’t that great this time. Steaks were over cooked. But the manager took care of us and apologized for it.,3
"It was good, great for date night.",4
First time at this location. The ambiance was great and so was my server. Great way to ring in the new year :),3
"Great service, kind and enthusiastic staff. Amazing food, as always!",4
I found the music to be far too loud given the fact that we were just dining.,3
Food and service were fantastic. Server was so kind.,4
The Keg is my favourite place for steak.  I'm a picky eater and they get it right every time.  I like blue rare filet mignon and they do it perfectly!,4
Everything was good except we didn’t get anything even though I mentioned that it was our anniversary. Normally we get something when we go to the other KEGs but I guess this location doesn’t offer any cake or dessert for the special occasion,4
"There isnt much to add when it comes to the Keg.  You know what to expect, and, they deliver quality food and service every time.  I've had only 1 steak below my expectations here in 33 years, and that was on a Jan 2nd.  I give them high praise for an impeccable record.....the service is top notch.",4
"We were at this new location for the first time, but definitely not the last. Everything was amazing, including the food, the service and the atmosphere. Our server Alana (sorry if I spelled it wrong) was wonderful and took a very good care of us. I had crab cakes, which were great, and I tasted a prime rib from my hubby’s plate, which was excellent and melted in my mouth… I had no idea it could be possible…. And of cause we had Billy Miner ice cream cake that was to die for! We would definitely recommend this place and will be back soon!",4
"Special ambiance, attentive service, and exceptional food. The tables close to the fireplace are definitely romantic spots. Highly recommend it for any gathering.",4
Four of us went out for pre Christmas dinner together. Server was friendly and took care of us well. Food was very good. Would definitely go again!,4
The food was good but expensive. Server was nice but showed a bad attitude at the end when he saw the tip because it looked like he wanted more because he expected more. This was very ungrateful and just showed that your server was not genuinely nice but he just wanted a good tip. I was very upset because i really tipped within my means (10% as i simply could not tip more since i was paying a big bill in the first place). If other customers tip more is because they can afford to tip more. Does the restaurant really want to serve a clientele that is wealthy enought to tip to the expectations of the servers? How about people who can't tip 15% of the bill? They should not come eat at the keg???wonder if this is due to low wages that you pay them. I would not go again to any keg location as all they care for is money and money.,2
It was worst than usual,1
"We had a great time with a birthday celebration.   

The prime rib was excellent as normal!",4
Met with friends and the food and portion size was very good ....waiter was great ... we talked for quite a bit and were never bothered or pessured to leave,3
"Greeting at front desk in non busy time was not very good.  The two people working it did not acknowledge us for several minutes.  One was on the phone---the other just pre-occupied.  Finally they ""noticed"" us and it was a warm pleasant ride on the elevator.  We were seated near a lovely fireplace and then sat there ignored for about 10 minutes.  All the while behind us a large party was giving speeches etc very loudly.  Finally two waitresses arrived from down below and apologized when we asked if anyone was waiting on this section.  Service was good from then on.   The noise behind us continued.  They should have put the music up louder to make a better ambiance.  We  mentioned the large party spoiling a couples night out and  to their credit we were given a complimentary dessert.  We go to Kegs all over city .  Staff here should perhaps go to some other locations and be trained.  Won't go back to this one.  Too many other choices in the area and in the city.",1
"Erin was an awesomely attentive server.  Excellent steak/beef as always.
Seated upstairs in front of fireplace.",3
"Great for what they are know for..steak.
My guest's loved their steak! My fish came under cooked and tasteless...Service staff and manager were great. Ambiance was fresh.",3
A little loud due to the seating area arrangement.  The worst part was two tables over they were constantly playing YouTube videos and very loudly.  The staff refused to say or do anything.,2
"Loved the lobster gratinee appetizer, the suggested 12oz baseball top sirloin and my birthday cake treat  Bill Miner pie was to die for!!",4
"Delicious, reasonably-priced steaks.  OUr server could not have been friendlier and made the evening even more pleasant.",3
Overall we enjoyed our dinner.  The steak is always good no matter which cut.  The custard part of the creme brule was a little too sweet for my liking. The atmosphere is always comfortable.,3
"My husband and i have been to this location in North York a few times now. The service is impeccable .....and they have options for my dairy allergy. A gentlemen came out and explained how my food will be handled with no cross contamination from other foods being prepared in the kitchen.
They also do not rush you and you can enjoy the ambiance and relax.",4
Always Delicious!!,4
Great service. Great food.,4
Made reservations months before hand for a birthday event and was given a bad table in a bad area of the resturant.,2
"During the last 12 days I have been at the Keg, 3 times. I like it obviously and have had 2,5 very good experience.  The reason for 2,5 good once and not 3 is that on the last visit (Saturday night) it was busy and we waited a long time (much longer than normal) for our food. Also, the steak was well done and not medium. On the other hand, when we told the waiter about the meat, he offered a new steak without a doubt. Due lack of time we refused and they reduced the bill afterwards. All in all, a very good place, I am going again.",3
"Our server Andreas was incredibly helpful and accommodating to us.  It was our anniversary and he definitely helped make it special.  He notified the chef's that we had a gluten and dairy allergy and all of the dishes were taken care of with the utmost care and professionalism.

Andreas recommended wine, helped us at every turn and even recommended a dish that was not on the menu to us but being made as a special that day.

Thank you for a wonderful experience we will not soon forget.",4
"Great overall experience. Had a wonderful waiter by the name of Andres. Looked after us as if we were his  only table! Great conversation with him, and he knew the menu perfectly. What ever he suggested was bang on!
Would definitely come back...hopefully all the waiters are as attentive, courteous, friendly and knowledgeable as Andres!
5 STARS!!!!!",4
Steak is always good and cooked perfectly (though I order it without Keg spices.  I find it too salty. I add my own salt).,4
Our server was attentive and helpful.  The food was good as usual for the Keg.,3
"Steak was not hot, also not spiced. Coffee was not hot when served, just warm. Second cups were hot.",2
"Excellent food. Manager enhanced our experience, filling in when needed.

Great vive also!!",4
Excellent as always,4
The prime rib was delicious as always!  Haven’t had steak at the Keg in over two years and it reminded me how I should have it more often.   Great value and the sides were also delicious.  We ordered the garlic mashed potatoes and also the double baked potato.,4
"Very good dinner overall; service, ambience, food!! Can’t go wrong with Keg, in my experience! It was my first time visiting this location but it will not be my last!",4
"Went for a quick escargot and French onion. Overall great taste, atmosphere and service",4
"Our experience at the Keg was really good. Most of the staff were professional, and any mistakes or issues were quickly resolved. I had the special and my wife had the pistachio crusted salmon - food was delicious.",3
"The keg has been a staple for a long time as a place to go for a good not great place for steak.  They've all been renovated and have a nice ambiance.
Our server was particularly charming and helpful",4
"never lets me down, always friendly, attentive, excellent food and  you can now make reservations",3
Anniversary,2
The service was fantastic.  Not sure which wine to select so I was given the option to taste a few.  Very helpful.  The food was delicious and I was surprised when a birthday cake came for me.  Wonderful night!  Thanks very much.,4
"We were celebrating our 19th anniversary and had a great dinner. Staff were friendly and food was great. The restaurant was comfortable. We had ordered a 10 oz steak and a cauliflower steak (good for vegetarians). It doesn't sound like a lot but we were full from our meals. For dessert, we were given a free slice of cheesecake (to celebrate) because we couldn't have ice cream. The cheesecake was light, smooth, and delicious! Thank you to the Keg!!",4
"Food great as usual.
Service was weak....table maintenance, communication and weak service recovery.",2
"A little disappointed at the size of our table. There were four of us and they seated us at a table for two. We were very much crammed in and barely had room for our drink glasses never mind our food plates. 
When we asked if we could move to a larger table although they first said no they came back and said okay but they clearly made it seem like it was a problem to move us. So rather than be a problem we decided to stay at our assigned table. If the table we sat at is truly for four then they need bigger tables.",2
Great dinner. The steak was exchanged in no time due to be a bit blue. This was very impressive!!! Just love keg😍,4
"Honestly, I didnt like the Prime Rib steak since it is not basically grilled on the surface. I chose it by mistake. I should have gone for fillet minigon or something else. But the place was cosy and everyone were professional.",4
We ordered a special meal. It turned out the meal was not good and we didn’t like it. The restaurant took it off from our bill,4
Anniversary,3
"The service was awesome , Friendly, great place to go for a birthday ! Food was amazing",4
"Great service, great food and a very comfortable place to dine. Very nice ambiance.",4
"We always have a good time at this location. The restaurant is modern and calm.  The service is always excellent.  No complaints,  only praise.",4
"My family and I were celebrating a late thanksgiving and made up for it by coming to the Keg at North York. Our server was Andreas (I very well could have butchered that spelling) and he was fantastic. We ordered the special for that day and it was delicious, the manager Michael recommended it and it was amazing.",4
I've been to other Keg locations before but the service here was the best I've had ever. Would definitely come back. Food is always delicious,4
"I visit quite often, but service was a little off this evening.",2
Very nice new Keg at Yonge and Sheppard. Food was terrific but found the service a bit rushed.,3
Keg usually provides a good consistent experience. Nicecwelcome at the door. Friendly servers and goid food with a goid variety,3
Great dining and service! Dissapointed that we could not enjoy happy hour drinks as we were with my grandchildren and could not eat in the bar area. Happy Hour not in restaurant.,4
We had a great evening and our server was amazing.,4
The service was friendly and professional. The prime rib was cooked to perfection. Great value for money.,4
"The wait staff was great - friendly, quick, knowledgeable.  The food was great as usual.",3
"Chris our waiter was extremely nice, and knowledgeable. 

The food was amazing.

The lighting was great.

Nothing I could complain about even if I wanted too. 

Thanks!",4
"Our 1st time at this location and very pleasantly surprised by several factors. Spacious dining area, fast service, beautiful decor, quiet and above all, excellent and flavourfull meals for all. Keg Onion Soup is a must-have, the Prime Rib (medium-rare-medium) was one of the best I've had, ribs well done and Lobster Tails were 'like butter'. Definately coming back, even though the meal for 4 without alcohol was $200.",4
"As always a great customer experience, a couple of the prime rib came out slightly overcooked...they took it back right away and provided new ones no questions asked.",4
Great ambience and fantastic service! Food was good but pricey. You can go to a higher quality steakhouse for not much more.,3
Food was delicious as usual.  Service was great too.,3
"I always leave the Keg 100% satisfied, especially the one on Yonge north of Sheppard in North York.",4
"We had a fantastic first anniversary dinner there. The backdrop with the fireplace was a wonderful touch to a great romantic dinner. The staff even helped us by taking pics of us to make our special occasion. 

They should offer something special to people celebrating anniversaries. We got noting even though we told them what the occasion was.",4
"While the restaurant was ""with it"" insofar as understanding my allergies, the food that was served was inedible. The Keg should understand how to properly cook a gluten free piece of salmon without it tasting like a dried out, tasteless piece of wood. The service was terrible. It took us approx 30 minutes to get hold of our waiter when we had finished the meal. The restaurant was so cold we wanted to leave asap. On a positive note, my wife enjoyed her meal but not the service or temperature.",1
"The steak is not as great as I expect
My lobster is way better than the sirlon",2
We liked the feel of the place--lots of room yet cozy. I was impressed with the decent size of salad and the steak -medium rare-was done just as I like it. Also the baked potato was well done which is how I like it.  The service was very friendly and the waiter surprised my husband with a birthday dessert. I definitely am looking forward to going back again to explore the bar area. It looked very cozy while still being surrounded by all the action.,4
"As often happens with open table customers they gave us a lousy table that I had to change.
Service was ok but they brought the mains while we were still eating our salads.
Asked for HP sauce and took 3 requests.
Medium Rib steak was very fatty and came rare. When we complained the waiter tried to tell us that we were wrong and it was medium. What a dolt!
FYI - had a $26.00 Open table Reward. Took two managers to figure it out on the billing.
Sirloin was ok.
Keg seems to have gone a bit downhill. Quality of the meat seems to have suffered over the years. 
Would rather go to Mortons and pay more but get a good quality piece of meat.",2
Delicious for lobster fest. We had the steak and lobster and ordered an extra side.,4
"Service was fantastic, and food was great!",4
The appetizer salad was wrong ..... my husband's steak had to go back as it was undercooked and then the waiter dropped direly cutlery in my lap. The only thing they offered to do was take a matini off the cheque.,2
Iceberg salad had a tiny bug. The steak was cooked as expected but too cold. Mashed potatos was creamy and great.,2
Beautiful new location with great service.  Unfortunately no parking.,4
"Love the relaxed feel of this place. Food was delicious, and service was nice.",4
Both the environment and food are great. Tuna Tartar is highly recommended.,4
An excellent new Keg venue.  Great atmosphere and food.  Drinks are pricey.  That is a disappointment.,3
Dry steak. Unchewable. with a lot of fat. Wouldn’t go there a second time in my life.,0
Very nice. Food was great. Service was a little off this time but did get better.,4
Our server Sadar was exceptional!,4
Anniversary,2
"Our server was excellent I believe his name was Brandon orBrendon.
 He was very patient, I wouldn’t say we were the easiest table to serve. We did find the music little loud and did asked to have a turn down which he         
took care of immediately. We spent quite a long time in the restaurant and at no time did he appear to want us gone. The food was the usual excellent Keg quality. The lobster tails delicious. The only thing missing and it’s very small is that I asked for a Gibson martini and the bar does not stock the small Gibson onions.
All in all it was a great experience.",4
"Arrival was a bit strange; we'd reserved but they didn't seem to know which table to seat us at. However, it was fine as there were several tables available and we didn't have to wait. The server was knowledgeable about the menu and friendly. I had the cauliflower steak, which was very generously portioned and delicious. The sangria was excellent as well. Dining felt private but not disconnected. Overall a great experience.",4
Brought my parents for my mother’s birthday. This was my second time visiting and I was again blown away by the amazing service! They really made my mother’s birthday an incredibly enjoyable and memorable day!,4
Food and service are good - a little pricey but that's the same in most Toronto Restaurants,3
"It's great to splurge on a steak once in a while! I think if you want to go as a group or couple, it's a good choice.",4
"Steak was perfect, hot, tasted great. Service was fast and yet not hurried. Everything was great. Staff professional and happy to serve",4
"Service,  food , ambiance was good, Even given  a free dessert for our birthday celebration. My only 
Complaint is rushed service .... we were eating  and enjoying our appetitizer and said we were in no rush , however, our main course was brought to the table while we were still enjoyoying our appetizer and all the dishes had to be shifted around to fit on the table. I find this unacceptable. It wasn't busy and just not necessary to be rushed.  I didn't think it was necessary to control our ordering but I guess I was wrong. Next time I will just order an appetizer  and when WE are ready to order the main course , we will order. Live and learn......",3
Great location. The food was good.,3
"We spent our one-year wedding anniversary at the Keg North York and had a great time. Our server, Kevin, was very professional and attentive to any needs we had. Will definitely be back for sure!",4
The food is consistent as always at The Keg. The service is not what I’m used to from visiting other locations. Our server Bianca did not come to check on our table after our food was served. Water was not topped up until the end of our meal when our dishes were being taken away.,2
"Watched the Canada Day fireworks from the patio, great view and the patio is quite cozy.",3
"This was our third visit to this Keg, service and food were excellent once again.  We will return.",4
"The food was excellent! The service was great! Well timed and friendly. Our server's name was Gora. It is pricey. We would happily return for dinner again. I highly recommend the starter crispy friend cauliflower. I had the top sirloin 12oz., comes with roasted red pepper and green beans. My additional accompaniment was garlic mashed potato. At an additional cost I added sauteed mushrooms.",4
"The food was not bad and met the standard Keg expectations, but what struck me was how INCREDIBLY FREEZING COLD the temperature was inside on the 2nd Floor. We brought this up the second we sat down when we noticed the draft, and even the hostess and our server, Alex, acknowledged it as well. What we found strange was that they acknowledged it was cold for other guests, but said if they turned it down, the restaurant would become too stuffy, and then they promised to have the Manager turn down the A/C, but it never happened. We could even hear many other guests complaining about the cold temperature as well, in the dining room and in the bathroom. One guest even had to order the French Onion Soup, to deal with the freezing temperature. And I overhead their waitress even rationalizing and encouraging their order of the soup - last I checked, you should not be using the restaurant temperature to sell your menu items...??
It was so cold we had to order hot drinks, and even then the drinks and the steaks became cold at record speed, even when the dish the food came served on was piping hot when it arrived. It turned too cold to eat, in a matter of minutes. Very disappointed we were unable to enjoy our dinner under the frigid atmosphere, literally.",1
The food and service were great but the air conditioning was much too cold. Some in our group had to put on their jackets.,4
"Great food, great service.",3
"A very decent experience; was here for a family birthday, ambiance is great, good food, great service.  One miss is the kid's menu - overpriced and undervalued.",3
Father’s Day,4
"This was a steakhouse and when they ask you how you'd like your meat cooked, they should respect that.  We ordered medium rare, all 3 of us, and we each received medium.  And it was late.

We really like the Keg, but were not happy with how the meat was cooked at this location.  We will not return to this locat",1
Had the keg classic and added the shrimp tempura 👍🏻,4
"Excellent service. Very good food. We noticed a price increase. Hope it doesn't keep going up, we won't be able to afford The Keg. Keep prices the same.",4
The staff here are very welcoming. Briar was our server and was excellent and Swayne took us to our table and was most welcoming. Food was excellent.,4
Our waiter was awesome and piece of birthday ice cream pie unexpected . Everyone on staff was friendly and very helpful. We would return for sure and would highly recommend the restaurant,4
"This new Keg is quite lovely.  The experience, in terms of service, was quite good.  The steak, for both my son and I, was fine but not up to the usual Keg standard. Undersea Sones and plainish.  Ok but not great. Not my usual experience when dining at The Keg.  I assume this location is still in the learning curve.",3
having the toast from the waitress was a nice touch,4
no complimentary cake on my birthday....how disappointing!!!,0
"Occasion of the dinner was for my boyfriend’s birthday, we didn’t get the basic bread that every table gets nor the complimentary cake at the end. Will go to other locations next time.",0
Awesome service and food. The waiter got us a birthday cake surprisingly and it was delicious.,4
"Had a fantastic dinner. Our waiter, Andreas, was very friendly and attentive. We have dined at several Keg locations throughout GTA and this is one of our most memorable dinners. Will return again.",4
"Amazing food, every bite was delicious. I had the top sirloin classic with the garden salad and garlic mashed potatoes - great value for great taste!",4
Awesome service and food,4
"We went here on a Thursday night for our girls’ get-together. The waiter we had (we forgot her name) was really great. The food was also great although we waited a bit longer than expected. Overall, a very good restaurant!",4
"-Hostess at front desk not welcoming, and unfriendly.
-Feature crab added to meal was dry and flavorless. 
-Server was attentive to our needs as we had a child so she provides snacks for the child. After the order was taken she did not come by to ask how the food was, and took a long time to get the bill. 
-We were there for a special occasion and usually they ask, but no one asked.",1
"Poor food, poor service and so loud that I could not enjoy my meal with my wife. I have noticed that the franchise has gone down hill but tonight's experience was the worst so far. Unless you are going for drinks with the boys I'd stay away.",0
Excellent food. Probably my new favorite Keg location.  First time at that location. Great staff.,4
"The food was great.   The server was awesome.  Alana knew exactly when to approach us throughout our time there.  Alana’s suggestions were perfect.   It was a first date for my lady friend and I.  Alana helped the date go perfect.  It I don’t get a second date with this lovely lady I was with, it would have to be the company the lovely lady was with. (Me)",4
"Previously ......
always had good experiences... particularly with respect to service 

.... however .... not this time 

Had a very important business dinner with a principle of a top tier restaurant chain 

bill was $400 plus tip 

always had to search for the waitress in order to order more drinks .... or clear the table 
.... or to bring the bill 
.... she was never around",1
Waiter was awesome and made the experience much better. Food was good and it was quiet and relaxing,3
"As always the prime rib roast was cooked to perfection. The service was excellent. Our table server, Candice, was both friendly and professional. The dining room,although busy, was always quiet enough that you could easily carry on a conversation.",4
"Always reliable.  Very good steak and seafood. Our friend had a vegetarian dish of califlower and lentils and pronounced it excellent.  Pleasant service but slow.  New restaurant opening jitters perhaps.  In any case they recognized it and bought the first round of drinks, so we felt well taken care of.  The Billy Miner Pie is complimentary for birthdays - very good and a nice touch.",3
"We thoroughly enjoy eating at the Keg at North York.  The  taste and quality of food is  excellent, as is the service, the staff are friendly and courteous.  The design and decor of the restaurant is modern with an impressive roomy entrance/foyer.  We have a property almost across the street and welcome the addition of such a quality restaurant in the area and shall be dining here quite often.",4
"During this particular evening we were served very fast. Food was delicious. The salmon just melted in my mouth! Service was great as usual, waiter was attentive and polite and had good recommendations.  We really appreciated the rapid service that evening and made it on time for our movie which was right after. Thanks for yet another lovely evening, The Keg!",4
Very great food and service!,4
It was a really nice setting compare to the Leslie location.,3
"We all enjoyed the meal, but the noise level  and music at this location catered to a younger clientele.",3
Restaurant was so hot and the ac wasn’t turned on.  Service very slow.  The food though was very good.,2
"Great experience again, love The Keg - service was very also on point, kudos to Ian our server!",4
"I made mention of my wife and my allergies (dairy) on our reservation and mentioned it was for her Bday. We go to kegs around town regularly and this time, my prime rib was way below par.  The rest of the food, I understand, was good. When desert came around, the Keg was kind enough to spring for a free desert for my wife and offered her a most beautiful piece of... ice cream cake. Seriously? I did not say anything at the time because they clearly do not care otherwise, they would have paid attention to my informing them of our allergies. Unfortunate. Next time, I think we'll visit the competition across the street. That was a really stupid way to drive away business and it was irritating that their lack of apparent care for customers. They ultimately ruined, or at least put a serious downer,  on my wife's bday celebration. This is one location we will *never* re-visit.",2
"I went to the Keg for my boyfriends birthday. The food was great, however I told the server that it was my boyfriends birthday and he said he had something in mind. I noticed other tables receiving a birthday treat. The server forgot about his birthday by the end of dinner. I was disappointed because I had mentioned in the reservation and to the waiter about the celebration.",2
"As usual, had a great dining experience at The Keg and had a great time celebrating my husband’s birthday. Will definitely tell all our friends about this great location and will return for more meals in the future.",4
Good But noisy,3
"Keg Classic meals are great value and we are glad to have The Keg back in the neighbourhood.  The floor plan at this location  is a bit crowded, and we were at a table in the middle of the floor, surrounded by various booths & banquettes. As a consequence,   wait staff bringing meals to nearby tables had to hover over our table as we were enjoying our own food. Next time we will request a booth.",4
"Very comfortable surroundings.  The staff members were friendly and welcoming.  Out
server Nora was outstanding.",3
"Staff is trained to be very welcoming which is refreshing 
Our waitress was wonderful. We had a table a little out of the way which was nice. Beautiful ambiance! I had the blue cheese filet, my husband had the prime rib. Both were excellent.   
Id recommed a reservation.  We did this and were sitted right away",4
"we celebrated my birthday at the new Keg on Yonge Street, north of Sheppard Avenue. The ambiance is beautiful, our server Adrian was terrific, and they gave us a free piece of Billy Miner pie for my birthday.... the food was absolutely delicious.   It was  a little loud, but otherwise terrific.  There are no washrooms on the main floor, but there is an elevator to increase access.",4
"Sadra O., our Waiter, was great.  Friendly, efficient, great service.",4
"An amazing new addition to the North York restaurant scene, this Keg location has great ambiance, the staff are friendly and helpful, and the food was superb. My best Top Sirloin steak at a Keg restaurant so far.",4
"We attended this location for the first time, and had a great time!  The service was excellent, warm atmosphere and the food was delicious!  Will definitely go back.",4
"My guest had the special, which was outstanding. I had the 6 ounce sirloin and it was excellent except I should have asked for no Keg spice and unsalted butter on my potato. Too much salt.

Presentation excellent. Ambiance, lovely but it got noisy.",3
We all had the special which involved a lot of winter vegetables and it was very well done.,3
Steaks were fantastic as always. Very consistent. You can't go wrong with the Keg.,4
"We loved the experience of being treated as though we were extremely special!  Our waiter was phenomenal as he knew his menu and was extremely personable!  We were seated on time, our food came out in a good time and we loved the privacy of our seating.  Thanks!",4

"I have been to the Keg in other locations for many years. However, my best experience was at the Keg in North York. The service was fabulous and the food was excellent. My friends were health conscious and they were very impressed by the quality of the food.

I will return to the Keg in North York for sure!!",4
"Food, Service, and ambiance were all excellent. The only detractor was the coffee at the end of the meal. As coffee lovers, we enjoy a coffee after the meal to round things off. The coffee served this date was very strong and bitter, to the point, it was disgusting and undrinkable. To add insult, it was $3.50 per cup. That coffee has to go!!!",3
"All started when we were seated at a with dirty plates and wine 🍷 glasses with lipstick 💄 on them. 

Horrible  Service rude not trained staff. Bring the apatizers 20 mins after ordering and take our food order then bring the food as we’re eating our appetizers. Bring the food 🥘 back steak was cold under cooked as per there ordering methods. Ordered medium and got literally red in the middle not pick ? Asked to see a Manager apparently they all were not available?",0

Joanna was very attentive and at the same time she didn’t hover. There was a small issue but wasn’t a big deal and the manager was so nice. I was so impressed. Nice dinner date for me and Hubby for our pre-Valentine’s,4
